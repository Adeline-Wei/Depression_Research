102490375	dejaisdope	2014-12-23 04:40:07	People blame Obama for everything, lmfao. If it's raining too hard outside, it's "his fault."

102490375	dejaisdope	2014-12-27 20:11:29	I don't mind completely removing people from my life. God gave me one life to live, and I refuse to waste it with all the wrong people.

102490375	dejaisdope	2014-12-30 16:46:54	Many times, "friends" can't support you PUBLICALLY because of how they've spoken on you PRIVATELY.
102490375	dejaisdope	2014-12-30 21:37:28	You don't protect your feelings by acting like you have none.
102490375	dejaisdope	2014-12-30 22:12:13	"Life is short" isn't just something to say. This shit really flies by right before your eyes if you waste it.

102490375	dejaisdope	2015-01-04 00:40:17	Me being forgiving is literally a gift and a curse at the same time.
102490375	dejaisdope	2015-01-04 03:48:56	Girls will stop speaking to their friends over the littlest shit, but will forgive the same cheating, lying ass dude over and over again.

102490375	dejaisdope	2015-01-07 00:33:13	Don't be all in my face privately then try to switch up when other people come around. That's a quick way to get deaded, forever.
102490375	dejaisdope	2015-01-07 00:33:53	Most of the time when your "friends" can't support you publically, it's because of how they've spoken on you privately.
102490375	dejaisdope	2015-01-07 00:35:27	Keep grinding. Someone you don't even know is out there rooting for you, while someone you know isn't.
