104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-06 20:45:27	@ujhphoto no, this is the one you want: http://t.co/FiCJizcLYn
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-06 20:48:21	@viewfinder_m6 @HamishGill it's tiny but I can see the edges clearly. It's easier for me to use than the 50 lines in the M3 for that reason.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-06 21:01:22	@pdexposures this should actually be from the @PlasticImagery account, really. #idiots
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-06 21:11:18	@lenire I don't think I have, actually. I'm pretty good at keeping track - just my life has gotten in the way of recording.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-06 21:59:49	I think @patrickjclarke is my favourite.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-06 22:03:13	@ajleaps you make cakes with gluten and you don't mock Simon enough. You're slipping.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-06 22:05:30	@ajleaps well. Now I am HEARTBROKEN.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-06 22:06:43	Ayumi-ashi everywhere because my feet hurt. #skateboardingJudoka
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-06 22:06:57	@ajleaps how do we feel about cheesecake?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-06 22:08:31	@ajleaps it's only the best thing ever.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-06 23:10:06	.@MarisaWriting I assume he thought it was caramel.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 11:38:00	@dominik_mrzyk to me, good cameras are heavy. Lightness is a sign of cheap unreliability.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 11:38:25	@ujhphoto you'll love it - it's crazy in-depth.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 11:40:33	@ZDP189 I like the argument that lomographers are failed photographers.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 11:46:24	@dominik_mrzyk but that's the thing; the Symbol is cheap and unreliable. Weight doesn't necessarily suggest quality...
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 11:46:51	@dominik_mrzyk ...but for me, the lack of weight and heft generally signifies lack of quality.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 12:25:21	I hate Firefox; I have to quit and restart it every few hours or it just takes all the memory it can. Depressingly, Chrome is even worse.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 12:25:40	I wish Camino was still being updated. :(
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 12:32:22	@dominik_mrzyk But it's solid brass, not plastic.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 12:42:29	@dominik_mrzyk Because it's honestly not so heavy that it feels uncomfortable, but the bulk increases stability and usability.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 12:43:12	@dominik_mrzyk ...anyway, didn't you use a Praktica for a while? Those things are not only heavy, but angular and brick-like.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 12:43:46	@ujhphoto I think my Macbook's maxed out at 4GB. That would have been super-fast when this was new in 2008. Browsers have got too bulky.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 12:53:17	@dominik_mrzyk @jasonepowell Cheap plastic tat. :p
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 12:53:54	@ozalba I guess it's because new machines all have excessive amounts of RAM... plugging memory leaks isn't a priority anymore.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 12:55:24	@ozalba Pretty much. If you watch the activity monitor in OSX you can see the usage of any modern browser climb gradually over time.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 12:57:20	Fixed it! It's a shame the tripod hole is at the wrong end for this solution but it's still better than the lugs. http://t.co/STe2vDfsQi
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 13:11:40	I reset Firefox 45mins ago. This is its RAM and CPU usage now - it only has one Facebook window open. What a joke. http://t.co/ziyKz4peIR
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 13:15:12	@TomWelland it doesn't download fast enough! Maybe I need more RAM to download more RAM?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 13:44:41	That soul-crushing disappointment when you're working on an article, pick up your coffee cup and find out it's empty.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 14:15:16	@ChrisFecio This sounds like my last job. Absolute hell on earth.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 15:01:42	@jonasx70 @pdexposures I seem to only ever run across this one. http://t.co/xE1OFUcs1a
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 15:06:34	@jonasx70 Can't stand Opera. Sleipnir was nice, but didn't handle some pages properly. Camino was best, but it's now unsupported.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 15:07:20	@jonasx70 Hah! Thought you were referring to the X300. Yeah, it's an M5 setup, but on the wrong side.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 15:07:58	@jonasx70 The X-300 is pretty much dogshit. I mean, it's usable. But it's far from great.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 15:08:48	@jonasx70 Yeah - see my other tweet. I was talking about the X300. Which is dogshit. DOGSHIT.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 15:10:04	@jonasx70 It just represents the worst kind of 80s consumer-grade shite. Throwaway, disposable, plastic shit built only to upgrade later.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 15:14:24	@jonasx70 No; one for dads and tourists everywhere, later to be replaced by low-end DSLRs.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 15:15:00	@jonasx70 That's the great pity of the Minolta SLRs; a lot of the bodies are plastic tat but the lenses are cheap and great.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 16:19:45	@filmdevelop Isn't that the only reason people make cool videos now - to try and scam money out of people to fund their holidays?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 16:21:46	@filmdevelop You have to make the video first, along with a pseudo-justification for people giving you money. Like a postcard.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 16:22:06	Sorry @gosnapjet, but you have the most obnoxious twitter account I've ever seen.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 16:23:25	@jonasx70 2GB? On Windows? You must be a bloody masochist.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 16:25:02	@filmdevelop Hush money? I don't think they're organised enough for that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 18:56:58	@barneymccann jealousy: I haz it
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 20:32:38	"You'll no longer be kissed and kind, as you long for intuition; as you have to learn the lesson twice... Have you ever been all messed up?"
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 22:43:24	@JoeyPascoPhoto @BelieveInFilm The classic: Ansel Adams' The Negative. It's the most in-depth explanation you'll get.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 23:46:29	@JoeyPascoPhoto @cnhedeen @BelieveInFilm good call! If you end up setting up a darkroom, I highly recommend getting The Print as well.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-07 23:50:03	@cloudyimages that only works for early Barnacks. IIIfs need a SYOOM. 😞
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 00:13:57	@cloudyimages I don't know if the Zorki has the right coupling mechanism. It'd work on your standard, however....
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 09:11:30	@cloudyimages you should spend that money on a scnoo, then.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 11:02:58	@cloudyimages the scnoo's pretty small. You should give it a look.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 11:05:45	@barneymccann lolz. Bought a pint yet? Sweden makes even London seem cheap.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 11:07:05	@cloudyimages I think I might go on Monday or Tuesday, actually. You game?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 11:12:04	@cloudyimages bah. Work? I find that hard to believe.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-10 19:53:27	@DYPKA I favour this choice quote: http://t.co/zcSc4CQsqT
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 11:51:07	@cloudyimages ain't nothing wrong with that finder. Perfectly usable.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 12:25:30	@cloudyimages neither does your standard so it'll be a good match. 😉
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 14:25:46	Pleased to report that my basic addition to the Canon 7 makes it a lot more comfortable to use for a whole day. http://t.co/QyQZY7g69H
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 14:27:09	Now... does anyone know if it's possible to add another strap lug to a camera?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-09 13:29:30	As much as I was moaning about the town I live in last night, at least it's not as bad as where I grew up: http://t.co/r7FdYaUwmE
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 14:54:38	@Uncl3Rick I'm not technically "slinging" it; I'm using one strap lug and a tripod-mount one. Is that what you meant?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 14:55:56	@Uncl3Rick I've stayed away from slings because I don't like the single anchor point. Seems unstable.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 14:59:24	@ujhphoto @uncl3rick "upcycled" from an old seat belt, you mean. (Fucking hate that word and everyone who uses it.)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 15:02:15	Now this is a proper fucking zine: shit paper, shit photocopying, great zine. Nice one @MarisaWriting! http://t.co/LyrplgbMQu
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 17:58:36	So there's this website that lets you find people near you who like similar music, right? Well, I tried it. Nothing. No one. At all.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 17:58:44	Sometimes I feel so very out of place in this town.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:05:34	@yeknom Believe me, when I look through people's music tastes locally, my music collection looks fucking awesome in comparison.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:06:04	@yeknom There is a whole lot of Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, the Foo Fighters...
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:11:27	@yeknom @lenire LET'S JUDGE EACH OTHER. Name three of your favourite bands, Dan.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:15:10	@yeknom @lenire Duran Duran is a bit of a weird choice. What's the deal with The Magnetic Fields? I don't know them.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:18:47	@yeknom @lenire OH GOD UKULELES ARGHHHHH
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:19:43	@patrickjclarke I have to admit Radiohead are possibly the one band I truly hate... But more for the fanbase than anything.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:20:32	@patrickjclarke Quite enjoying Manchester Orchestra from the first track I've gone for on Spotify, though. Good stuff.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:21:00	@yeknom @lenire I skimmed through the album you suggested and tried a bunch. Didn't really sit right with me... and then ukulele. Urgh.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:21:25	@patrickjclarke I just don't see the fuss. I don't think they're geniuses and what-his-name's voice drives me nuts.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:21:52	@patrickjclarke @yeknom http://t.co/DzVNcAUW96. Quite a fun little site.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:23:18	@patrickjclarke The top played is "I Can Feel A Hot One". It's a pleasant little ballad - a bit twee, but well done.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:24:44	@yeknom @lenire You've not even seen my list yet. Three great bands: The Weakerthans, The Promise Ring and Placebo.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:27:23	@yeknom @lenire Okay. The Promise Ring I could get (if you lived in a hole in the 90s), but PLACEBO? Really? https://t.co/XbvHAqEHNt
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:28:10	@patrickjclarke That's almost as good a name as OFF!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:29:18	@patrickjclarke This is pretty damned good.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:30:21	@Beckwould Every night.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:32:35	@yeknom @lenire God, that was a HUGE hit for them. It was in the soundtrack to Cruel Intentions so I assumed it was big there, too.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:33:31	For those keeping track, my triggers are:
- Lomography
- Ukuleles
- Thom Yorke 
- Conservatives
- The phrase "I'm not racist, but..."
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:34:41	@yeknom @lenire Wow. And I thought I was inept with pop culture. http://t.co/bxYSGSOuS4
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-12 01:54:25	I'm seeing a lot of posts about coping with depression right now. This is a good thing. What isn't is that it will be forgotten in a week.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:36:08	@yeknom 1.5? I expect at least two from any sane person.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:36:51	@yeknom Unless you mean you only question why 1.5 of them would annoy me. In which case, proceed.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:37:25	@yeknom @lenire It's not bad as far as American teen movies go. Certainly the best of its kind (not that it means much).
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:41:05	@yeknom Ukes are a poor man's Mandolin; thin, no sustain or punch, and painfully, irritatingly twee.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:46:03	@JeremyKruger @yeknom Don't joke about these things, Jeremy. Violence that way lies.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 18:48:33	@lenire @yeknom It's not the best one, no. But it is the one most people know.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 19:01:20	@patrickjclarke @lenire @yeknom Thom Yorke's is whiny in the worst way. I can listen to bad singers, but Yorke grates.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 19:06:27	@AUL1969 Is it really a town of rich white girls who just listen to middle-of-the-road shite? Because sometimes that's what it seems like.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 19:08:20	@patrickjclarke I'd take that over Yorke, but it's not really my thing.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 19:11:12	@patrickjclarke I understand. I'm listening to this right now. She can't really sing but I'm still loving it. https://t.co/rJbrEN6OYT
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 19:13:21	@AUL1969 Ssssh, don't hashtag them. Someone else might eventually learn how Twitter works and find out.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 19:13:35	@patrickjclarke I think they predate the XX by a long way. ;)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-08 19:17:30	@AUL1969 Ah, yes. I forgot about that name conflict. That often made my job more awkward than it had to be.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-09 00:16:12	@RachelRayns You're talking about Forbrydelsen, right?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-09 00:18:10	@RachelRayns ENGLISH VERSION? Urgh.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-12 21:15:49	@giacomofrullani @filmsnotdead @ilfordphoto @BelieveInFilm That depends entirely on whether you're Winogrand or Cartier-Bresson.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-12 21:44:09	@MarisaWriting The Art of Manliness is a fantastic blog. I've been following it for years - it's always teaching useful skills.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-12 21:48:50	@cloudyimages @adamsimonstweet I'll fix yr link, Cloudy: http://t.co/C5m4fw6BfU

That 15mm would be amazing on the Standard.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-12 21:51:08	@cloudyimages @adamsimonstweet Yeah, I could do that for you next time I'm in town.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-12 22:01:10	@cloudyimages 28mm never comes with a finder. Expect to pay a pretty penny for the combo.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-12 22:20:29	@cloudyimages I've considered many screwmount wide angles. Best options are the 21mm Skopar and the 25/3.5 Canon, as far as I'm concerned.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-12 22:21:06	@cloudyimages The 28mm Canon lenses also come with a finder if you can get them in good condition.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-09 19:57:50	@dominik_mrzyk Are they like larger gloryholes?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-09 21:56:36	@amanda_raney ALL THOSE LOOSE HAIRS

#OCDoverload
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-09 22:01:13	@amanda_raney Why do you think I shaved all mine off?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-09 22:11:07	@amanda_raney Yeah. I tried growing it long and ignoring it when I was about 17 but it just made it worse.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 00:08:24	@patrickjclarke @lamlux I'm always bemused by people who walk around with Hassys with the prism finder. So unnecessarily heavy.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 00:09:32	Okay, guys. I'm supposed to be editing an episode of @pdexposures but I don't have any music for the intro. Give me something I can use.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 00:10:09	@patrickjclarke @lamlux the mirror is bad. The weight is worse. I understand using it for studio or landscape work. Nothing else.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 00:11:09	@lenire I am not using one of my tunes or songs. Nope. Not happening. No. Never.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 00:12:16	@lamlux @patrickjclarke holy fuck. Poor Rollei, being subjected to the horrors of a prism finder.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 00:30:03	@JeremyKruger @lenire somehow, I don't think that's you, Jeremy.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 00:30:53	@lenire @JeremyKruger also, ukuleles suck. And Jeremy knows this.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 00:34:03	@lenire @JeremyKruger it's a poor man's mandolin. As someone from bluegrass country I thought you'd understand.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 00:43:16	Sometimes I like bolting as many things onto my Leica as possible. Just because. http://t.co/aCYRKYymU9
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-10 00:57:34	I love skateboarding. I really do... But every so often, it makes me feel like Sisyphus.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-10 00:58:12	I can learn all the tricks I want, but I'll never be able to keep them all at the level I need.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-10 00:58:41	And on top of that, every new step forward opens a myriad of possibilities. Maddening, confusing, difficult possibilities.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-10 00:59:31	But then... "I say never be complete, I say stop being perfect, I say let... let's evolve, let the chips fall where they may."
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 00:49:58	@lenire @jasonepowell @jeremykruger To me, everywhere south of the mason-dixon is bluegrass country. hicks.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 00:55:12	@jasonepowell @lenire @jeremykruger Between southern and northern states. Couldn't tell you exactly which states fall where.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 00:55:27	@jasonepowell @lenire @jeremykruger Starts south of Pennsylvania and moves west, right?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 00:57:53	@lenire @jasonepowell @jeremykruger South, surely?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 01:26:03	Here's something from the @pdexposures cutting room floor; my thoughts on America and my six-year life plan. https://t.co/vaHGQsTPth
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 01:51:15	@JoeyPascoPhoto If @hvywts have a track they'd be happy us using, we'd love to feature their work on @pdexposures!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 02:08:12	@lenire @marisawriting @nmatospdx Listening to it during the edit, I think it's a great episode. It'll disappoint the GAS-heads, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 02:12:26	I am so glad I bought these bluetooth headphones. I can go and make a cup of tea while still working on a podcast. #Britishheaven
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 02:22:55	@hvywts @joeypascophoto Hey, I'm just always glad to hear some good new music - and it's nice to be able to promote it a little.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 03:25:54	BECAUSE PEOPLE ONLY BOUGHT EXPIRED AND SHITTY ONES “@mgagle: WHY ARE ALL THE GOOD FILM STOCKS GONE”
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 03:48:27	@samsnch @jasonepowell @mgagle Portra is a poor man's Provia. Which is going because people aren't buying it. Because they're IDIOTS.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 21:56:37	@filmdevelop @marisawriting @yeknom @eugenbaban We've not even bought @lenire a Leica yet. Marisa will have to wait.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 22:07:00	@MarisaWriting @filmdevelop That pink Leica M3 makes the lever wind look even more like a penis.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:24:44	Took a Canadian lad for his first proper fish &amp; chips and a proper ale in a proper British pub today. Welcome to the motherland, son.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:26:33	@IsaacLagarda Ha! All Canadians are our prodigal sons... led astray by their uncouth neighbours. :P
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:38:38	@alexwardphoto If you're going on holiday and have a car, try a trip to Falmouth. Beautiful town &amp; has a great photo lab w/ film selection!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:40:30	@viewfinder_m6 @cloudyimages I think you'd have to come to MW's offices too. Spent an hour in there today. SO MUCH STUFF
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:41:41	@HamishGill Notes from a long-time turret user: they often have a thinner "shoe", so they fall off some cameras.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:42:09	@HamishGill The parallax markings were originally measured for a Kiev, so don't expect them to be accurate for a screwmount Leica.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:42:30	@HamishGill And on many, the 28mm setting is far wider than a 28mm lens. Which is odd.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:43:04	@HamishGill BUT the crosshairs and additional space makes for a great compositional aid. It's especially good for a 135mm.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:45:13	@viewfinder_m6 @cloudyimages Nothing substantial. A hood and yellow filter for my Summar, a Weston, and a strap &amp; FILCA thrown in for free.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:47:14	@HamishGill 135 options: Jupiter 11 (not accurate on a Leica but BRILLIANT on a FED), Canon 3.5 (fucking HEAVY), Leitz Hektor and Elmar.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:48:03	@HamishGill I was thinking of getting the Canon but it's so damned heavy. The late 135mm Elmar f4 would be the best option.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:50:18	@HamishGill The Orion 15 - f6, actually. And no. I think it's more like a 24mm finder on my particular turret. Weird.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:50:49	@viewfinder_m6 @cloudyimages Keeping it screwmount, mate. It's all about the LTM.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:52:13	@HamishGill Damn. I was in MW today &amp; didn't spot the £49 Hektor. I probably would have had that. The £125 Canon + finder was a bit much.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:54:54	@HamishGill My Pentax MX + 28/2.8 has the same FOV as my 28/35 mini finder. The turret is noticeably wider.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 20:57:01	@HamishGill What are people asking for them now?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:00:00	@IsaacLagarda They don't count for much of anything.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:03:10	@HamishGill I paid MW prices for mine. =P 

Part of me would quite like a dedicated Leica 35mm SBLOO, though....
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:07:31	@HamishGill They're bloody great. Every time I've been there in person they've thrown stuff in for free, too.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:11:16	@HamishGill It's just all a bit sickly, pale, wishy-washy blergh. This is what I expect from colour film: https://t.co/Sd8DsqEV3b
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:12:39	@HamishGill Provia, motherfucker. The best colour film in the world.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:23:07	@HamishGill Nope. Still Provia: https://t.co/XdAbaDFWc3
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:25:09	@HamishGill I don't know why these aren't on Flickr. Because, you know. Provia. http://t.co/p92o2D17bE
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-14 12:27:41	@StephenSidlo well, it's an awesome box set!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:27:59	@HamishGill Take it outside, make it flare, and pretend @Beckwould is a folk singer who needs promo photos: https://t.co/3C5RoJngqi
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:28:22	@HamishGill But you know what else Provia does really well? Fucking everything. https://t.co/OBeTD9DXL0
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:31:57	@HamishGill WAIT I'M NOT DONE! It even does low light because it's reciprocity characteristics are AMAZING. http://t.co/J68W2SUYAP
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:32:15	@HamishGill Peak Imaging, of course. They don't charge extra for E6.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:35:01	Basically what I'm saying here is that Ektar and Portra can fuck off. Provia is the one true god. #believeinfilm #believeinE6
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:36:07	See, @eugenbaban knows. RT "Balda Baldix with expired Fuji Provia 100F #believeinfilm #filmphotography http://t.co/rXJlxeePCa”
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:39:40	@HamishGill I think I might have to as well once the weather picks back up. It's been ages since I shot colour... my Leica's never seen any.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:45:50	@eugenbaban It's beautiful, isn't it?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:49:44	@TomWelland How many a day do you have normally? I worked out today that a 20-a-day habit costs about £2500 a year.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:50:29	@tomwelland I say this because this is how @viewfinder_m6 justifies his Leica purchasing addiction.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 21:58:44	@eugenbaban 100F is. 400X is dead, which is a bloody shame.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-11 22:32:33	@cloudyimages @viewfinder_m6 they have the 15mm + hood and finder for £269...
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-14 12:21:03	@StephenSidlo Thank me later. http://t.co/xfKBXXskof
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 11:11:02	@cloudyimages It's similar to the Summar - but like most Soviet lenses, the chance of it working on anything but a Fed is slim.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 11:18:06	@cloudyimages Tempting, but I barely even use the 50/1.5 I have for it. A collapsible 50/2 would be nice, but a waste of money.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 11:22:11	@cloudyimages A Leica CL? Why?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 11:25:03	@cloudyimages Have you ever used one? Or even held one? I strongly suggest you do before you buy one.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 11:27:22	@cloudyimages Fun, yes. Comfortable, no. They're the most blocky and stubby Leica there is in my opinion. Totally anti-Barnack.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 11:28:51	This week's @Pdexposures podcast features @MarisaWriting, intellectual discourse on gender &amp; @NMatosPDX's naked arse: http://t.co/s0x6GbXzhV
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 11:33:00	@cloudyimages 40 is so close to 50 that it's pointless. Even 35mm is so close that it's barely worth using both. Go for Canon's 25 or 28.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-14 14:40:35	@lamlux You say that but I imagine it's going to cause you to use more film than any camera purchase. Congratulations!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-14 21:55:50	My god, everyone's getting married. I mean, I'm happy for you and all, but can you please stop? Us poor single peoples are being left out.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-14 18:03:18	@MarisaWriting hah, movement? The use of Instant film is not a political revolution. It's not even a social one. It's just a medium.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-14 18:07:42	@MarisaWriting but calling it a movement puts a lot of weight onto it when it doesn't have that significance.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-14 23:33:37	@ellacumber I ask myself that question all the time. Also, I need that t-shirt.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 01:33:13	@gavinstenhouse damn. I've wanted to play that game for ages. What's it like?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 01:34:00	I've felt sick all night. I think it might be that vegan gluten-free pizza I had for dinner... Tofu cheese just isn't right.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 01:43:48	@gavinstenhouse I really need to find myself a gaming group down here. I've not even cracked open Carcassonne since I moved. Urgh.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 01:48:29	@ClickErik I just need cheese in my life, obviously.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 02:14:04	@filmdevelop I'd definitely go to her parties.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 02:14:45	@filmdevelop Probably not. =(

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 13:59:50	@jasonepowell @pdexposures @MarisaWriting @NMatosPDX glad you liked it, mate.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 11:33:33	@dominik_mrzyk @samsnch @aglkxxp WELL IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE THAT THEN I'LL TAKE MY HELP ELSEWHERE. Humph.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 14:18:02	I have run out of clean teaspoons. I am not sure what it says about me that this seems like a valid solution. http://t.co/MFkMGBiGy3
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 15:16:25	@jonasx70 it's actually pretty good as far as instant coffee goes. Doesn't taste like burnt cat shit at all.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 18:16:01	@schneidan @shootfilmride good lord, why have I never thought of that before???
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 18:41:47	I've never really done backwards walk the dogs before. Turns out yes, they are bloody awkward.… http://t.co/y0ALGoi8aZ
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-13 20:07:51	@amanda_raney Actually the police write them for the suspect/witness &amp; the person in question merely signs it. But yes, still hand-written.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 20:26:56	@TomWelland Fuck the Hassy. You have an M6. You don't need a Hassy.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 20:31:00	Bloody hell. LTM Nikkor 50mm f2 for £119? That's a bit of a bargain.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 20:38:13	@TomWelland And whenever you travel you inevitably shoot more when you carry less.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 20:42:57	@ShellySometimes As much as I'm sick of losing my entire body mass in sweat, Autumn means rain, which means less skating. =(
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 20:44:33	@ShellySometimes You should try factoring in skating at all times.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 20:45:36	@ShellySometimes Come to England for six months and I'll train you.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 20:47:19	@ShellySometimes Well, you need to get energy from somewhere.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 21:23:53	@schneidan @shellysometimes And rhubarb crumble, and fish &amp; chips, and proper tea, and flapjack, and great curry, and non-plastic cheese...

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 23:52:45	@amanda_raney FP-100c has all the good instax colours but can be used in much better cameras. I just wish there was a faster one!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-15 23:57:43	@amanda_raney my Polaroid 100 has a seemingly untraceable light leak that makes FP-3000b impossible to use. Polaroid really were a bit shit.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-16 21:13:05	@adamsimonstweet correction: it's not A standardised measurement.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-16 21:13:47	@JeremyKruger @juliarevitt hmm... Servicing is rarely worth it now. Replacements are cheap. What's the problem? I could probably fix it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-16 21:44:24	@juliarevitt @JeremyKruger entirely possible. Is the needle exactly on zero when the back's completely covered? And which model is it?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-18 18:37:13	I'm personally quite surprised the last episode of @pdexposures hasn't had more downloads. What are you waiting for? http://t.co/f0p9sPGhDC
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-18 20:24:50	@StefanLillis It started raining as soon as I turned up at the park today. Thankfully there's a covered piece of flat around the corner.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-18 21:11:16	@lancekingphoto @marisawriting Understandable - but it's like using inches instead of centimeters. The world has to move on.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-18 22:55:20	@MarisaWriting you're a dick.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-18 23:00:22	@cloudyimages thanks mate, you just inspired me to have a cull. Amazing how you rack up so many worthless accounts in your feed!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-18 23:45:35	@lenire @MarisaWriting I had an involuntary swearing fit simply from the memory of it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-17 00:02:30	@juliarevitt It's okay. I've fixed most problems on these meters before. And yes, those screws are a pain.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-17 00:05:16	@juliarevitt I've had some success pushing them round with a screwdriver like this, but it ain't pretty. http://t.co/M9SBs1OPvj
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:35:41	@MarisaWriting My thoughts are that this is too serious, and too complicated, a subject to be dealt with effectively on Twitter.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:36:33	.@MarisaWriting The short version - as difficult as it is - is that "citizen journalism" is as bad, if not worse, than mainstream media.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:36:56	.@MarisaWriting It's half-baked, amateurish, dangerous, incompetent, and putting proper journalists out of a job.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:37:25	.@MarisaWriting Moreover, it's skewing the mainstream media, and making THAT amateurish too. Too many photojournalists can't get work now.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:38:41	.@MarisaWriting Is it "exposing the tyranny of the system?" Yes. But it's also undermining REAL journalism....
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:38:59	.@MarisaWriting ...and it's that which we badly need, not a bunch of well-meaning idiots with iPhones.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:40:07	.@MarisaWriting Then they should be fighting back. "Citizen journalism" is often without proper context or understanding of the situation...
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:40:53	.@MarisaWriting ...and as such is largely untrustworthy, and as dangerous as consciously biased reporting.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:44:44	It feels strange for me, as a Marxist, to be arguing against direct democracy and proletarian involvement in the representation of events...
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:45:23	...but the actual results of the recent democratisation of journalism are too deleterious to ignore.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:45:58	As Chomsky has himself pointed out, trying to fully comprehend a subject requires a lot of work, a lot of reading, a lot of time.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:46:47	You can't just wade in blind and try and create a defining viewpoint of an event based solely on the fact you happen to have an iPhone.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:49:53	Anyone interested in how badly democratised journalism has gone, read up on the kids who've ran off to play at war photography lately.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:50:28	Too many casualties because they don't have the training, the know-how, the guidance or the support.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:51:16	@MarisaWriting @jasonepowell Sorry, Marisa. That's not how it works. It's bad enough in the UK at protests. I imagine America is worse.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:52:35	@jasonepowell @marisawriting I've seen  police attempt to be arrest someone filming an event based on fake drunk &amp; disorderly charges.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:53:10	@jasonepowell @marisawriting He wasn't even in the way of the police - he was just filming their behaviour. And he was stone cold sober.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:54:38	@MarisaWriting, have you ever spent time reading IndyMedia? Or heard about FITwatch in the UK?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:55:14	@marisawriting The reality of what you're talking about is far darker, far more dangerous, than you seem to appreciate.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:55:38	@MarisaWriting Filming police at riots and protests has literally ruined people's lives. It's serious business.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 00:56:35	@MarisaWriting Bear in mind that what you're advocating is a revolutionary act. You can't dress it up as anything less.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 01:12:56	@lancekingphoto @marisawriting The courts? HA! You think they'll ever find in your favour? You think they represent your best interests?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 01:14:05	Part of me thinks this should be mandatory reading for everyone involved in #MarisaChat: http://t.co/lxqtaNygm4
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 01:18:52	@jasonepowell Or, alternatively, turn you all into well-read fellow travellers.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 01:19:10	@jasonepowell (because I suspect everyone involved in this chat will be on the watchlist now anyway)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 01:51:23	@ShellySometimes I'd also like to add this to the discourse: http://t.co/1JRhSrRqGG
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-16 15:08:56	Any idea what these things are, Twitter? I've never seen owt like 'em. http://t.co/Q4PFm0Gz0f
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-16 15:26:39	@The_Old_Penfold looks about right but that's an American plant. What's it doing in Kent?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-17 23:52:15	@cloudyimages those colours look fucking weird, mate.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-17 13:19:43	@juliarevitt I honestly don't think it's worth it - it'll cost you more in shipping alone than a "new" Weston would cost.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-17 13:20:22	@juliarevitt I know a place in London I can probably find you a mint, working Weston for about £5 - £10, for example.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 14:23:27	@Mattmar10 @nmatospdx @lenire No, but I'll make sure we do. Thanks, Matt!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 15:02:36	.@FujiInstaxUK I like it (and have the piles of prints to prove it), but you know what I like more? Black and white film. Combine the two!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 21:27:44	@dominik_mrzyk KIEV! What do you make of it so far?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 21:39:19	@yeknom I think I know someone in Canada who might be interested. I've passed it on to him, so maybe it'll finally get sold.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 22:00:40	Classic (and probably my favourite) Powell-Peralta advert featuring one of the greatest freestylers of… http://t.co/UedQakhGsu
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 22:22:32	@yeknom Just hope for your sake that he bites.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-20 00:11:53	@filmdevelop Peach crumble sounds amazing and now I want six of them.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-20 09:25:07	RIP, Kodak BW400CN. Buy as much @IlfordPhoto XP2 as you can afford to ensure at least one C41 B&amp;W film stays around! http://t.co/Ua8yhCWgnq
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-20 10:52:14	I’m fairly certain I’ve bruised a bone at the base of my spine. While we’re at it, my ankle doesn’t feel great, either. I’m falling apart.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-20 16:06:14	@ShellySometimes @lenire But Shelly does not have the epic booty.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-20 16:11:28	@lenire @shellysometimes Agreed. It's been part of my daily routine for years. See also http://t.co/4IVOWH4nuB.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-20 16:15:17	@MarisaWriting I'd say when results reliably match intent.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-20 19:05:58	@lenire @ShellySometimes @NMatosPDX I think we'd make a beautiful (and angry) couple.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-20 23:02:09	@NMatosPDX The official Twitter client has started doing that, too. Great, isn't it? Urgh.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 22:57:23	@adamsimonstweet 3 minutes!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 23:33:31	Assuming @adamsimonstweet is still alive &amp; has successfully avoided joining the 27 Club, it's now his birthday. Give the old man some love!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-19 23:51:12	@filmdevelop You always want cake.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-20 00:04:59	@filmdevelop How do you feel about crumble? That's what we really need to ask.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-20 00:07:14	@filmdevelop Well, the latter is a given. I am a (gluten-free) crumble eating machine.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-22 12:28:26	Editing a submission to Pdexposures.... it's double spaced. RAAAAAAGE

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-22 14:07:10	@Ade968 Luckily it wasn't long, so I managed to get through it okay - but the Find/Replace tool is always a good choice.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-22 22:03:55	@viewfinder_m6 'appy birthday mate! Here's a present for you - a Rollersnakes vid from 1991. https://t.co/QrXkehik8B
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-22 22:04:08	@cloudyimages Didn't you say 21 earlier?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-22 22:16:30	@cloudyimages Well, I'll keep an eye out. MW has the Canon 25 in LTM and Voigtlander in M, but no finder.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-22 22:25:37	@cloudyimages I think I'd actually prefer the Canon for 25 - RF coupled, comes with finder, and more solid with a classic look. So tempting.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-22 22:34:34	@cloudyimages Here you go mate - a bargain: 
http://t.co/TvGHFOYOIu
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 01:18:37	@cloudyimages well, if I had the money I'd grab the Canon. Keep it in the right time period, and no dirty plastic!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 01:27:43	@cloudyimages If you wanted to go the Summaron route you could borrow my turret finder until you found something better.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 01:30:28	@cloudyimages Bloooooooody hell.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 01:34:27	@cloudyimages There's a chrome one on eBay for about £270. It'd be interesting to compare it with the Voigtlander mini-finder.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 01:38:59	@cloudyimages I'm not seeing a turret. Do you mean the VIOOH?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 19:41:04	A basic #freestyletricktip for the easiest way to do a proper Casper. No feet on the ground, and only… http://t.co/Y2pmq45daD
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 01:42:25	@cloudyimages Yeah - that's a cropping finder, so it gets stupidly small for 90mm, but who cares for 35mm???
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 01:45:26	@cloudyimages Sounds like a good setup - but the Summaron needs a different, shorter, expensive, hood.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 01:46:23	@cloudyimages Scratch that - MW have a FOOKH hood for the Summaron for £49. That's half the price I've seen elsewhere. Bargain.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 01:52:13	@cloudyimages HURRAH!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 20:05:04	@AUL1969 For a second there I thought you were on about one of these: http://t.co/zz7KvenFfd
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 20:08:08	@AUL1969 Beautiful bit of tech! Shame Leica Geosystems and Leica Camera split up years back or you could have blagged one.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 20:26:15	Practicing Wing Chun drills to stretch my muscles after a skate seems surprisingly effective. @StefanLillis has his yoga, I'll have this.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 21:27:06	Just got a bit of shocking/not-so-shocking news. I guess I'm going to stick with the ply wife; so much easier to deal with.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 21:47:30	@TheRobertBowman Basically irrelevant. Get whichever is in better condition. Also consider the standard Yashica Mat or the Yashica 12.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 21:48:06	@TheRobertBowman (And trust me, I've had most of the Yashica line... the D is the sleeper and probably my favourite.)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 21:52:16	@TheRobertBowman Best response ever? Quite possibly.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 21:52:29	@cloudyimages Don't think I can afford it, mate. Gotta save the pennies right now....!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 21:58:45	@amanda_raney ply wife = skateboard. And yeah. Women are EVILLLLLL... or something equally over the top and overly-generalised.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 22:03:35	@amanda_raney At least when something goes wrong on a skateboard I know it's my fault.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 21:38:38	@PhotoGopher but AUTOFOCUS, yeah? #nevertrustautofocus
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 21:38:58	@BelieveInFilm A mouse. The bastard thing won't come out. I've tried cheese but it's persistent.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 21:41:43	@PhotoGopher Hah! I bet I could drink a bottle of whisky and focus a 1950's rangefinder better than that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 21:41:48	@PhotoGopher Actually, I know I can.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 00:03:01	@karligle I'll be fine (well, as much as normal, anyway). Was angry for a bit. Now I'm back to my flat, emotionless self.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 00:59:39	@samsnch 's bullshit, mate. 's all bullshit.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 01:30:23	@samsnch Hey, one day, my man; Leicas will cross paths and whisky will be poured.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 01:32:29	@DrShitlord @samsnch ply wife = skateboard.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 02:50:00	@DrShitlord @MarisaWriting all skateboards are for girls. A ply husband would just be a skateboard owned by a girl. #egalitarianism
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 03:19:52	It's 4:19 am and I can't sleep and I just want to go skateboarding but it's raining and I'm going to be so tired tomorrow and fuck my life
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 15:24:08	I just found out there is a Ju-jitsu club FIVE MINUTES FROM MY HOUSE. Why did no one tell me this sooner? FUCKING YES.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 15:30:25	@seecarlashoot It'll be my third martial art but it's so closely linked to Judo that I should have a good start for it. EXCITED.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 15:45:41	@The_Old_Penfold Bugger - yes! Totally forgot to thank you for that. Sorry, I am a terrible human being.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 15:45:59	@The_Old_Penfold It's great - very much of it's time, with lots of focus on 90s graphics. Very cool. Cheers!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 15:47:04	I finally wrote a review of the Canon 7; it's as obsessive as you may imagine. Read it on the @Pdexposures site at http://t.co/9NgPnGoQBC!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 16:05:38	@ArneKuilman @zdp189 I wouldn't pay anywhere near that for a P. It's a nice camera, but probably only €150 (€200 at most).
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 16:06:33	@arnekuilman @zdp189 ...although, if the lens is included and it's not a piece of crap, it could be worth €349. Tough to tell.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 16:10:15	@ArneKuilman @zdp189 I think I'd rather have the pre-war Contax behind it, personally. They're lovely.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:08:37	@PhotoGopher "Show us your best manually focused drunk photo! no zone focusing or wide-angles allowed. Extra points for a 135mm lens."
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:09:00	@amanda_raney What's that in English? I can't use this old-world scale.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:10:28	@lenire @photogopher As long as you're not over f4 on a 50mm, yes.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:11:49	@lenire Fix it. With hammers.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:15:39	@amanda_raney Well that's fucking horrible, but at least your humidity is low. We average 80-90% in Summer.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:19:42	@jasonepowell @lenire @karligle Nintendo has been coasting by on Zelda and Mario games for decades. So predictable and boring.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:24:08	@jasonepowell @lenire @karligle I'm kinda over videogames. The vast majority are getting tired and predictable. Some more than others.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:25:02	@jasonepowell @lenire @karligle Franchises are the worst part. That's what leads to lazy game design. Anyway, I'm going backwards in gaming.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:25:20	@jasonepowell @lenire @karligle I'm currently somewhat obsessed with Theme Hospital. Now that was a FANTASTIC game.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 16:31:24	@amanda_raney There's nothing benevolent about @nmatospdx.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:26:54	@amanda_raney GAH! We obviously have very different eyes.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:27:39	@jasonepowell @lenire @karligle Other things I'm feeling: Final Fantasy VI, Final Fantasy Tactics, all the Final Fantasys, ever.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:30:31	@amanda_raney It's just too oversaturated - and not in a good (i.e. Velvia) way. That's why I ended up giving it all away.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:32:00	@amanda_raney Everything looks vaguely cartoonish; I met and photographed Arthur Scargill and it ruined the shots! http://t.co/Ibc3dmvujV
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:32:29	@lenire @jasonepowell @karligle I had a Master System. It was so much more awesome purely for Sonic. SO FAST
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:32:56	@lenire @jasonepowell @karligle It was like pinball! That you could control! And FAST! Fuck Mario. That was tame in comparison.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:34:04	@jasonepowell @lenire @karligle Oh, wow. We had the 2600. I loved that thing. Adventure was AWESOME.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:34:30	@amanda_raney Exactly. Bloody horrible.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:34:51	@amanda_raney The depressing thing is that it was SO good before Lomography changed their supplier without telling anyone.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:35:16	@jasonepowell Wow. We never had that. We had such a huge stockpile, though. Did you ever play Superman? That was laughable.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:37:02	Finally started tackling my library of scans. This is my "unedited/uncurated" section in Aperture. It keeps going. http://t.co/cgUWY1ph1E
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:37:52	@lenire @jasonepowell You say that like it doesn't happen now. In fact, now it's even easier to get away with - day one patches are common.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:42:14	@amanda_raney Hm. Interesting. The shutter mechanism is pretty solid on a Contax/Kiev. Could be something stuck inside it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:43:42	@jasonepowell I can't even tell what the fuck is happening here.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:48:39	@karligle Rollei 80S, actually. Good images, terrible film.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:49:11	@amanda_raney That's odd. Must be a result of the slow-speed escapement not being setup right. Not familiar enough with that on a Kiev.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:51:50	@karligle It was cut too narrow meaning it wouldn't fit in the reel properly. When I finally loaded it, two parts of the film were touching.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:52:17	@karligle So the developer couldn't flow properly, and three images were ruined. That's 1/4 of a roll in 120.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:52:47	@amanda_raney That's apparently safe on the Kiev, but you're right to be wary of it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 23:53:22	@jasonepowell Ahhh, classic game design. I miss those days.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 00:02:21	@amanda_raney Incidentally, no notes on my repair guide about your problem. The closest I find is this: http://t.co/tbMNJRzZJG
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 00:03:12	@amanda_raney I do quite like this book. http://t.co/U0uSN2rAgH
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 00:26:00	@amanda_raney But you don't know what's in there from the previous owner. Another common problem is film chips.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 00:49:20	@amanda_raney Certainly possible. Who knows?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 01:02:55	@amanda_raney Unlikely. That just keeps the bottom shutter up while the camera is cocked.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 01:15:40	@ShellySometimes Wait, Tyler Durden ISN'T REAL?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 01:20:42	@ShellySometimes does that mean I am Tyler Durden?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 18:37:03	Thinking of buying a rangefinder kit? Like 35mm lenses? Wear glasses? You should read this: http://t.co/GQmkj0VAMr #believeinfilm
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 03:04:28	I never understand why people tape over camera logos. As if anyone in the street will notice or give a shit.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-23 14:03:44	@Jpncamerahunter they should have gone one step further and started shouting "crypto-fascist!"
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 19:22:40	@dominik_mrzyk yeah - that's basically the gist of it. Canon so very nearly got it right; just remove the swing back and make it smaller!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 19:26:04	@dominik_mrzyk swing back is no better in this case. Removable baseplate with or without M-style back would be better.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 20:42:03	Like #filmphotography but hate Facebook? #believeinfilm but not Flickr's communities? Try this group out on Google+: http://t.co/z7Hm34y1it
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 03:07:45	@lancekingphoto Well, @cfclark raises a good point....! http://t.co/XCok0n4XBy
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 03:08:29	@lancekingphoto @cfclark I've seen people tape over weirder... like hiding that one bit of white makes you more "stealthy". Yeah, right.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 03:09:29	@cfclark I just think it's a ridiculous "you must do this" rule that all internet street photographers get drummed into their heads.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 03:09:55	@cfclark Which, of course, also includes using super-wide lenses and shoving their camera into people's faces to provoke a reaction.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 03:16:12	@DildoAaron @lancekingphoto @cfclark Eyes tend to react to movement more than they do a tiny bit of white lettering anyway.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 21:21:04	@dfdy_ You're missing out. It's a pretty tidy system and because everyone and their mum isn't on it, it's basically bullshit-free.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 21:29:17	@dfdy_ Just got to get involved with the right groups, then.... *nudge nudge*

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-25 23:19:01	@patrickjclarke @cfclark I'd love a Yashica 44. Beautiful cameras... just a shame the format's a pain in the ass to get hold of.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-24 15:18:32	@lamlux Moreover, it's much harder to find or fabricate parts when they break. Circuitboards and the like are difficult to replace.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 14:43:20	@cloudyimages Every shot I've seen so far the colours have been way out. What's going on with it?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 14:54:15	@cloudyimages This is my biggest problem with C41; chasing the colour issues.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-27 20:23:45	@adamsimonstweet Hah - wish it was! It'd hurt less. Now, if it was a Hassy, it'd probably have to be amputated.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-27 22:13:56	@cloudyimages you should have bought it and borrowed my Soviet turret.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 00:10:03	Although I buy local as much as is possible, Amazon Prime really is a bloody amazing service for things you can't buy on the high street.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 20:11:12	I am not sure if I have more or less respect for Kid Rock now, but damn, this is funny: http://t.co/Ad0fTIynoP http://t.co/jxSeAnGzJk
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 20:17:18	@ChrisFecio I bought the full reading list in the first year of University/college. I realised how pointless it was &amp; never did it again.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 20:17:34	@ChrisFecio I dread to think how much students spend on overpriced academic books they barely use.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 20:33:57	@dominik_mrzyk Jesus fucking christ. I knew it was bad, but that's something else.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 20:45:52	@dominik_mrzyk I'm going to have to save that because there's a common notion here that Capitalism "saved" Poland.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 20:49:14	@dominik_mrzyk I'm not entirely sure why that made me laugh uncontrollably but it has.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 20:54:16	@JuloPeter @dominik_mrzyk Basically, what we're in agreement about is that everything is shit everywhere.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 20:56:27	@JuloPeter @dominik_mrzyk Here's a fun economic infographic for you: http://t.co/cFohoOTiba
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 21:00:34	@dominik_mrzyk @julopeter I think including Poland would skew the point somewhat. We KNOW you poor bastards are... well... poor.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 21:01:49	@dominik_mrzyk @julopeter The Daily Mail, as ever, hammers that sentiment home nicely: http://t.co/1Fo4h2eLKa
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 02:31:00	Poorly foot. #skatelife http://t.co/QWRMV9OYaO
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 21:02:14	@dominik_mrzyk @julopeter Note "Poles, Lithuanians and Hungarians wealthier than the Cornish" - I lived in Cornwall. I can well believe it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 21:11:22	@dominik_mrzyk @julopeter Yeah. I had to leave Cornwall because it's economically fucked. It's probably worse than Poland for a few reasons.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 21:11:53	@dominik_mrzyk @julopeter The biggest issue there is the second home situation; rich Tory-voting Londoners buy holiday homes there.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 21:12:16	@dominik_mrzyk @julopeter which ramps up the price of local property, leaves half the county empty half the year, and wrecks the economy.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-26 21:28:52	@cfclark I love the Kid Rock shot in combination with the headline. it's just too perfect.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-29 03:02:18	@jasonepowell @MarisaWriting I used to be properly arachnophobic. Amazing what good application of logic can fix.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-29 03:03:44	@jasonepowell @MarisaWriting I couldn't get a clear abdominal view for identification, sadly. It moved too fast. http://t.co/kN2Wx1UxCr
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-29 03:13:12	@MarisaWriting @jasonepowell nah, I threw him out. I'm not willing to keep him around; he moved too bloody fast.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 17:40:37	@MarisaWriting Underexposure - or rather exposure for the highlights. You can almost see the scanner fighting for shadow detail.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 17:43:53	@MarisaWriting Well, yeah. Of course. Given perfect (or easily readable) light, a compact can do just as well as a manually set camera.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 20:37:37	@cloudyimages we'll have to do a shootout: 21mm Skopar versus 28mm Orion.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 20:38:37	@cloudyimages also, if it doesn't fit in the shoe, pick one of these up for cheap: http://t.co/f9ZFFGtGvH
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 20:44:33	@cloudyimages well that sure looks pretty.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 20:49:07	@patrickjclarke no thanks. It'd be overpriced, have an unnecessary kickstarter campaign and never work properly. Fuck Lomography.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 20:50:45	@cloudyimages Don't hack it - you'll lose money. Either upgrade to a If later, or pick up something like this: http://t.co/rkOmSGhLbS
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 20:52:01	@cloudyimages Part of me wants to upgrade to one of these: http://t.co/iketJ0eLeS

Not sure the improved image is worth the size, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 20:52:51	@cloudyimages That's crazy talk.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 20:58:10	@cloudyimages I wouldn't buy from them anyway; too expensive for my blood for something so relatively common.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 21:03:52	@cloudyimages Yeah; you're better off waiting until MW have the gear you need.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 21:34:20	@ChrisFecio well, my foot's still heavily bruised but I can just about walk, so, you know. Not too bad.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 21:41:10	@ChrisFecio I've got a friend visiting to skate on Saturday so I've got to rehab quick.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 21:54:36	@cloudyimages chipped, inner glass scratched? Fuck that!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-29 14:25:49	@RachelRayns Explosions in the Sky, Mogwai, Sigur Ros. Post-rock is a good brain stimulant.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-29 14:26:40	“@BBCBreaking: UK raises terror threat level from "substantial" to "severe" in response to conflicts in Iraq and Syria”

OH NOES! PANIC!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-29 14:33:00	Can I just state that I abhor any company that uses the term "analogue" for film photography? It's marketing speak for "I don't use film".
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-29 14:33:47	Seriously, "analogue photography" only came around as a way of marketing against digital. And to say "analogue film" is even worse.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-29 14:35:27	My favourite response to this was @cloudyimages': 
"Is that an analogue camera?"  
"A what?"
"Analogue."
"No, it's a film camera, you twat."
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-29 14:37:16	@ILFORDPhoto I'm using AGFA's APX100 and feeling guilty. I need to slam some HP5+ into something, quick.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-29 14:54:55	@AlexxxxCorona Well, the core reason to call them "digital" is the conversion of analogue signals to binary...
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-29 14:55:24	@AlexxxxCorona ...but that's no different to the workflow of 95% of film shooters. Scanning film isn't "analogue". It's digital.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-29 15:03:45	@AlexxxxCorona Now that's a nice word. I mean, it's still not as good as just calling it "film", but it's more inclusive (wet plate, etc.).
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-27 00:28:32	This might be a new record for me; this is what happens when you get wrapped up in writing instead of cooking. http://t.co/XvG4crXARl
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 22:38:09	@cloudyimages Now that's more like it. Might be worth trading some unused gear for...
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-29 02:52:57	@jasonepowell @MarisaWriting Jason, you're so full of shit. You can't even make out the abdomen from those shots.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-29 02:53:21	@jasonepowell @MarisaWriting (and, of course, spiders aren't mammals, so they can't even BE pregnant)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 08:18:24	@lenire just landed on it wrong and folded it over. No biggie; common injury. Few days of ice and limping and it'll be fine.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 12:09:17	@The_Old_Penfold I'm using peas, not rice.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 12:10:18	@ZDP189 and when those photos are taken, they have to be as intrusive as possible; extra points for flash and 15mm lenses.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 12:11:25	@The_Old_Penfold and I thought my joke was bad.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 12:14:08	@The_Old_Penfold nah, it's not much. Just an inconvenience. Didn't hear anything pop or feel a tear, just folded it over.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 12:23:17	@The_Old_Penfold I don't have a rolling pin but do have a Jupiter 11 lying around doing nothing. That'll do the job nicely.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 14:27:47	@lenire Nah; landed with the board on it and it bled badly underneath but stayed on. It's been growing out for MONTHS.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 16:45:55	@patrickjclarke @pdexposures it's worth it specifically for LTM 35mm lenses. Other than that... Well.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 17:04:49	@patrickjclarke The Fed 5 is the loudest RF I own. The Kiev is a totally different shutter, and almost whisper-quiet; just a little "snick".
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 17:36:42	@MarisaWriting Out of curiosity, what did you shoot that with?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-28 17:39:14	@MarisaWriting Not in trouble, I just wanted to see if I was right, and I was.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-29 16:56:03	@cloudyimages It's a fair comment.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 12:24:30	Saw an article in Amateur Photographer today talking about the "Weston-inspired" Lumu.

They've obviously never used a Weston.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 12:27:55	@filmdevelop They got 4 stars for the review, so it must have been the big bucks. £50, maybe?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 12:29:01	@artsemergency Guys, PLEASE learn how to use @buffer. Spread the message out through the day!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 01:41:34	@cloudyimages you'd think that, but I've heard of people drilling holes into cameras to get extra light leaks. They're idiots.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-31 14:52:52	@amanda_raney @AlexxxxCorona If you do want a Fed, go Fed 1 or 2 with a collapsible lens. They're the best options.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-08-31 14:54:33	@cloudyimages get some FILCA cassettes. Best option there is.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 13:40:31	A fun afternoon project; recutting an old single kick into a 1980's style #freestyle board. This thing… http://t.co/rgPU5Wmwqa
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 14:20:41	@iainkendall @filmdevelop That's unusual. I've never had a bad one. Where are you getting them from?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 14:26:12	@TomWelland @iainkendall ...and which is unusable if your phone battery dies, which is likely to happen if you're using the camera a lot.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 14:47:32	@iainkendall @tomwelland Does the needle line up at 0 when the back's totally covered?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 14:48:19	The new anti-terrorism measures being announced sound worryingly fascist... surprise, surprise.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 14:50:32	@iainkendall @tomwelland If they didn't move (and it's a late one - IV, V or Euro) the bar that locks the needle is usually to blame.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 14:52:42	@iainkendall @tomwelland If it's not that, the other reasons would be a trapped needle (because glass is loose) or faulty wiring (resolder).
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 14:53:45	@iainkendall @tomwelland The cells in them rarely stop completely, just "fade" - and most of the time that can be fixed.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 14:55:41	@iainkendall @tomwelland The fix for a fading one is apparently using an eraser to remove oxidisation from the contacts of the cell.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 14:56:10	@iainkendall @tomwelland I've never had to do it (I've only had trapped needle problems), but it's worked for people on RFF.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 14:58:04	@iainkendall 's alright. Just let me know how you get on; I'd hate to have to revise my "indestructible Weston" stance.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 11:10:32	@ZDP189 Hey, that's not my idea. But I find his project interesting, anyway.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 11:16:15	@dominik_mrzyk I was having them feelz and then I scanned two rolls of APX100 from behind my Summar. Gawwwwd, they're nice.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 11:19:30	@dominik_mrzyk Assuming you're talking about C41, I'd rather gouge my own cock off with a sharpened lens hood. Sod that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 11:22:33	@ujhphoto @dominik_mrzyk I rarely shoot colour but I only ever use E6 when I do. Much higher quality and easier to handle.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 11:24:12	@ujhphoto @dominik_mrzyk I love Velvia, especially in 120. But it's terrible for portraits; Provia's much more versatile.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 11:24:32	@dominik_mrzyk @ujhphoto Pay less, get less. Simple as. If you want quality, you've got to pay for it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 11:28:04	@ujhphoto @dominik_mrzyk I've not been in my darkroom much lately - only really printed a few portraits. Need to correct that soon.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 11:34:11	@ujhphoto @dominik_mrzyk But produces a higher quality output and is actually enjoyable? I know which I'd rather have.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 11:35:22	@ujhphoto @dominik_mrzyk Hopefully? Is this going to be your first time in a darkroom, Urban?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 11:40:39	@ujhphoto Tell me about it. I changed my enlarger and paper supply and now everything seems lower contrast than before. Learning curves...
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 20:48:23	@MarisaWriting @chrisfecio Under Marxist-Leninist theory, countries need a vanguard party to build their economy and progress to Communism.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 20:50:12	@MarisaWriting @chrisfecio No, because of outside interference. The USSR's development was redirected due to the Cold War.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 20:50:45	@MarisaWriting @chrisfecio They put too much emphasis on military development and internal suppression, but they had to.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 20:51:19	@MarisaWriting This is why Trotsky and Stalin fell out; Stalin thought he could build the USSR into a superpower that would survive.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 20:52:11	@marisawriting Meanwhile, Trotsky realised the only way Communism could succeed is via constant global revolution.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 20:53:33	@MarisaWriting What is interesting is that communism HAS existed successfully in small areas, but been destroyed by capitalist intervention.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 20:55:19	@MarisaWriting It's inevitable. It can only continue to function via constant conflict and exploitation. It's inherent to the system.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 20:58:16	@MarisaWriting Then learn, organise, educate and do something about it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 20:42:46	@MarisaWriting @chrisfecio If you think communism would be bad (or that it exists today) you don't know what communism is.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 20:45:56	@MarisaWriting @chrisfecio North Korea have a Communist party in power. They've not achieved communism. These are totally different things.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 21:15:01	@MarisaWriting Don't just do that... print an extract. it's copyright-free. Distribute it as much as you want.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 21:15:41	@MarisaWriting @chrisfecio I'd love to gather a bunch of like-minded people, buy a super-expensive house in the rich areas of England...
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-01 21:16:30	@MarisaWriting @chrisfecio ...turn it into a commune, change all the immaculate gardens into a vegetable plot and fly the hammer and sickle.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-03 00:06:34	@cloudyimages eeee, I don't know. I'll definitely have a go with it next time I see you but I don't know if I'd use it much.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-02 19:50:04	Post-skate lethargy. Every. Single. Time.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-02 23:13:22	So this came today - pretty stoked. The only issue is that I can't decide where to put stickers on it;… http://t.co/vGwEvPFV4i
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-02 23:56:33	@cloudyimages @mswildthyme when you said you were taking the Standard to bed, sleep wasn't what I was thinking you were doing.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-03 21:08:04	@ShellySometimes they still follow me. Which is interesting, considering I've never bought a single pack of their film.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-03 21:12:12	@ShellySometimes well, I do REALLY like tits, so I guess I'm part of their new target market.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-03 21:14:00	@ShellySometimes only if we can do borderline tasteless photoshoots involving tits. That's all I'm living for now.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-03 21:15:04	@ShellySometimes let me get some thicker glasses and lets get this on!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-03 21:16:43	@ShellySometimes I'm perfectly okay with one of those. The other, not so much.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 00:07:39	Sorting through my print boxes. There's some pretty good stuff in here, actually. Totally forgot about most of it. http://t.co/MqRfqQqgLP
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 00:33:35	So that's a whole pile of stuff organised into loose collections. Now what?! http://t.co/0GjE2AKi8W
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 01:00:52	I don't make 5x7s often but when I do they're a bit bloody lovely. Maybe I should sell these little things. http://t.co/tWUfV7hS89
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 01:24:28	@NMatosPDX it doesn't feel significant enough for me most of the time. They are nice artefacts, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 01:27:29	I just collated a portfolio of sorts. Out of 34 spaces:
- 21 were taken with a Leica
- 5 with another RF
- 9 with a TLR
- only 4 with an SLR
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 01:28:55	@NMatosPDX that's a stupid idea.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 01:30:39	Although people say "gear doesn't matter", you obviously produce better (or stylistically personal) images with a system that suits you.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 01:32:37	@samsnch and one needs the tools he or she feels most comfortable working with. An 8x10 produces higher quality images but wouldn't suit me.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-03 01:26:55	@ChrisFecio Maybe you're allergic to me.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 02:17:31	@DrShitlord yes, hence "another RF"; that's a mix of Kiev, Zorki and Canon RFs. And maybe you just haven't found the right RF.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-03 02:32:52	Most of the time I got nothing to say; when I do it's nothing, and nobody's there to listen anyway.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 03:52:54	@NMatosPDX @patrickjclarke @lenire I'm trying to sleep; barf!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 14:20:31	Finally recut the single kick; modern #freestyle and 80's freestyle side by side.… http://t.co/FOxeYB0TRj
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 12:25:37	A #throwbackthursday/#tbt to 2005, Callum Bowran with the best railwhip I've ever seen and the longest… http://t.co/2R6S2GFpox
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-03 14:02:55	For about the thousandth time I'm considering starting a ska band... And playing bouzouki in it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-03 16:41:19	Another depressing concession to the realities of being a #freestyle skateboarder. #freestylerproblems http://t.co/tmgfEX4YTM
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 17:49:26	@filmferrania So, the big question is... is that enough demand for you to restart 127 production? Or even... *gasp* 220?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 17:56:51	.@filmferrania (Can I just say that I'd kill for a reasonably-priced black and white 220, and I think many others would too.) #bringback220
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 17:59:14	@jasonepowell @filmferrania During my brief Kodak-heckling #bringback220 campaign it seemed like a surprisingly popular sentiment.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-03 19:28:24	This is probably the best satire of vaccine scaremongering I've ever seen. Thank you, internets. You're wonderful. http://t.co/DbwS2GO2UW
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-03 21:19:20	@Ben_Innocent @ShellySometimes you're more than welcome to it. I'll stick with the topless part.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-03 21:25:29	@lenire @MarisaWriting the classy boob shots demand TLR action.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 01:10:59	@ChrisFecio mine has been "I'm cold and dead inside." I'm glad you're now able to change yours.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 20:44:49	@jasonepowell @patrickjclarke @filmferrania no, but hardcore 126 and 110 users have been recycling and reusing cassettes for decades.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 21:36:18	The newly cut single kick in the middle of two "normal" #freestyle boards. It's not that much shorter… http://t.co/Ca219y1beh
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 21:42:18	Just been to the first meeting of a new #TunbridgeWells camera club. Seems like a good crowd; who wants to come with me to the next one?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 21:43:11	@ChrisFecio Sitting on someone else's couch in your underwear? Nicely played, son.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 21:45:18	.@cloudyimages Thursday 2nd October, 7:30 to 9:30 pm.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 21:53:13	@cloudyimages There's always a bed here for you if you want to crash.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 22:08:22	@Mattmar10 bit of a non-event though, isn't it? It's just a refined MP. I'd love it if they did something that was truly different.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 22:08:48	@Mattmar10 like an M mount version of the Barnack, or revisiting the M5.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 12:28:59	@lenire sorry! Ein moment.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 13:34:33	@HamishGill That's a bit bloody great, that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 14:16:27	@ShellySometimes well that is a source of much disappointment.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 22:30:56	Why did no one tell me about Rainer Maria while they were still going? You BASTARDS.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 22:31:22	@dominik_mrzyk solid combo. Depends on what you're likely to be doing. Kiev might be more useful.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 22:32:36	@Mattmar10 The M5 experience really ruined Leica. They've been pretty scared of innovation in their film cameras ever since.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 22:47:37	@dominik_mrzyk then Lubitel it up, my man. I miss using mine a bit. Great camera.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 22:52:58	@dominik_mrzyk ah. That's a bugger.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-04 22:56:16	@dominik_mrzyk well, duh.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 01:28:47	As ever, @karligle is doing amazingly well at our late-night Dead or Alive sessions. http://t.co/9MasleWefW
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 01:30:25	@cloudyimages tasty.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 01:46:28	I think this is a new record, even for @karligle. 30-0. http://t.co/Idh7KvGnPL
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 01:50:06	@cloudyimages yeah. Very nice - the lady, the lens and the shot. Good job.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 02:39:20	@ShellySometimes do you have dead or alive 5 on that PS3 of yours?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 03:14:42	@amanda_raney @filmdevelop a hammer will get it moving.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 03:21:16	@jasonepowell @amanda_raney LESS TALK MORE HAMMERS
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 03:22:27	@jasonepowell @amanda_raney LESS TALK MORE SLEDGEHAMMERS
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 16:37:04	.@seecarlashoot A Zorki IIc? That is a weird camera to put on a t-shirt.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 16:40:52	@seecarlashoot It's very distinctive. No other Barnack-style rangefinder has that weird extra space at the top.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 13:24:27	Well, it's not every day you get woken up by a phone call from one of your childhood heroes.

Bloody tired now, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 13:25:53	@samsnch You do realise the Myers-Briggs is absolute bullshit, right? It actually means nothing.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 13:41:19	Breakfast of kings. http://t.co/VTqgO0l98G
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 13:48:19	@mondostic If you start a podcast with a photographer from Portland and spend a year fixing his bad grammar you might earn one too!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 13:48:33	@samsnch @lenire Meaning it is not the same as it being correct.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 19:39:43	There's a party going on upstairs. I have an invite. Instead of going I am sitting here drinking coffee and trying to stay awake.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 19:46:12	@TomWelland @the_old_penfold I don't have the energy for that level of socializing.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 19:49:16	It's a little bit silly, but I'm quite enjoying this first trick. I can't figure out where I've got it… http://t.co/aS4ypv3jIz
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 20:20:33	@MarisaWriting It sounds bustling. I don't think I can handle that right now.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-07 17:39:52	@viewfinder_m6 oh, god. It's the worst soviet rf there is!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-05 21:40:56	@filmferrania Love the Breaking Bad aesthetic, guys.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-07 18:48:53	@viewfinder_m6 some of 'em are bang on, but not many. Got any wide open samples?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-07 19:01:50	@viewfinder_m6 definitely a bit out but better than most.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 19:51:58	@dominik_mrzyk If you shaved the quiff off and grew a beard we'd look identical.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 20:04:43	Spent this afternoon teaching a 13 year old lad some proper freestyle tricks; fingerflips, etc. Good to pass it on to a new generation.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 20:31:50	I may or may not be waltzing around my room on my own to the Amélie soundtrack and grinning like an idiot right now.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-07 20:59:19	I'm not alone in my bedroom for once; I hope she stays the night and doesn't run off. http://t.co/ttkpiqqhCG
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-07 20:59:36	@ChrisFecio no, I write okay too. OK is just a bit weird.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 03:23:56	@jasonepowell That stinks almost as much as the original setup. All anyone cares about re.. Maier is money, and I hate everyone involved.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 20:43:42	@MarisaWriting The weird thing is this just makes me want to skate. That is my dancing.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 21:09:35	@SoVeryBritish WHAT. Is this a test to see whose citizenship we need to reject?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 21:15:37	@MUFC_Sysum7 @soverybritish Hand me your passport. Now.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 21:24:58	As a Brit, I'm fairly happy with this outcome so far. @SoVeryBritish #alwaysmilklast http://t.co/JWPukJRdSR
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 21:29:34	Every time: “@SoVeryBritish: Hearing a recording of your own voice and deciding it's perhaps best never to speak again”
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-07 21:14:45	@ChrisFecio I think I prefer the capitalised version but would rather see neither.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 22:44:29	I swear Dr Pepper is like liquid crack. One glass just makes me want more.... injected straight into my veins.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-06 23:52:25	Things I like:

- When @NMatosPDX finds toys I like 
- When these two things combine
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-07 00:53:41	@cloudyimages You and me both, brother. You and me both.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-07 22:56:33	@MarisaWriting I think you should buy this if you haven't already.  https://t.co/3RU6cq1Orm
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 23:21:05	@MarisaWriting @shellysometimes @nmatospdx @patrickjclarke Lomography = low quality, huge markup. I expect most of these will break quickly.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 23:32:03	This is the most beautiful song I've heard all year. ♫ Situation: Relation – Rainer Maria http://t.co/ozQv8Fhibk #NowPlaying
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 23:46:17	@MarisaWriting It's a bit twee for my tastes, but it is lovely. #toopunkfortwee
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 23:49:04	@patrickjclarke @marisawriting @shellysometimes @nmatospdx Considering how much they reduced the Diana Mini in the last Kickstarter... yes.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 23:51:24	@MarisaWriting @patrickjclarke @shellysometimes @nmatospdx How much was a Yashica T4 brand new? Because half that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 23:53:30	@NMatosPDX @marisawriting @patrickjclarke @shellysometimes So half that, because Lomography build quality is half of Yashica's.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-09 00:36:49	@MarisaWriting She probably deserved it. You know, short skirt or something. Maybe a low-cut top.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-09 00:50:47	@NMatosPDX @marisawriting Actually, no. Economically you've reverted back to 1920s America. Politically you're not far off.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-09 00:54:53	@NMatosPDX @marisawriting They're basically trifles. Irrelevant details. The political background is similar, the narrative the same.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-09 00:55:08	@NMatosPDX @marisawriting Just now instead of women, it's muslims and homosexuals.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 11:29:08	“@filmdevelop: I was hoping this was a joke. http://t.co/kGsfj93gGz http://t.co/qWQg3msiYh”

Hey, at least there's no kickstarter this time.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 11:34:53	@lancekingphoto @filmdevelop my Holga actually has less vignetting. Have you seen the corners on those sample photos? No, neither have I.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-09 19:59:34	@dominik_mrzyk Nope. That's what you need. One 35mm, one 120, one instant. Sorted.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-09 20:30:26	@dominik_mrzyk instax is cheaper? That's crazy talk. Also, wait until you get your 120 developed. It'll blow you away.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 13:09:07	RT @ILFORDPhoto: "What's your favorite analogue blog? What makes it special?" 

Surely an "analogue blog" would be a zine? Just a thought.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 13:25:10	@ILFORDPhoto Then consider me biased but @pdexposures - http://t.co/XDZeD1cEca - is where I'd point you.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 14:09:52	@The_Old_Penfold Part of me thinks I could fill a @Buffer queue with Twitter snark for a week and no one would notice the difference.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 14:38:50	@The_Old_Penfold Buffer is a social media scheduling tool. It's pretty useful to space things out so you don't flood Twitter all at once.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 14:39:26	@The_Old_Penfold For twice as much as a Yashica TLR, too! Crazy bullshit is crazy.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 14:43:42	@buffer No - you rock! Thanks for making my life easier.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 15:11:10	That classy #freestyle look is so in this season. #freestyleskateboarding http://t.co/HEh59fJV3g
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 19:58:55	Falling asleep on the floor. Why does skating always make me so drowsy?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 20:02:59	@AUL1969 did you accidentally send all your drafts out today or something? That is quite the eclectic barrage of tweets.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 20:30:15	A spot of #casper nonsense from tonight's session. 

#freestyleskateboarding #freestyle #skateboarding… http://t.co/vG7Q1EEIS3
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 20:34:36	@Ben_Innocent thanks, Ben. I've been working on caspers a lot and they're about killing me.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 20:44:12	@Ben_Innocent it's never too late to start. Freestyle is tough physical exercise but it's not as hard on the body as street.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 20:50:53	@Ben_Innocent a dedicated freestyle board is actually fairly cheap and easy to get hold of now.... about $110 - $130.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 20:51:56	@Ben_Innocent The Marco Sassi one here is VERY similar to mine: http://t.co/lwsbVVM54u
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 20:55:20	@Ben_Innocent It'll take a while to get the skill level up, but it's worth it. There's some #freestyletricktip vids on my instagram to help.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 21:15:04	She's in my basement. I'm not letting her out.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 21:19:18	People don't get my subtweets... in every sense of the phrase.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 21:20:44	@DrShitlord But you are the king of the subtweet.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-09 22:05:36	Every. Bloody. Time. http://t.co/9xENlwlEes
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 22:11:41	Managed to win a girl over on Tinder with talk of counter-revolutionary bourgeois owls, and I have no idea how.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 22:13:41	Sometimes, I wonder how I've ever managed to even get a lass to agree to have a drink with me. Counter-revolutionary owls. Honestly.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 22:15:01	@karligle Well, not at this moment. I'm on a chair.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 22:16:26	.@lenire @karligle My Tinder game is SOLID. I've also managed long chats about Twister and won over Japanese girls with arty skate pics.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 22:19:57	I have no real clue what other guys do on Tinder but I gather it involves tranquillised tigers and Grey Goose vodka. I prefer my way.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 22:28:53	@karligle You should try kentish women. horses, tiger photos, holding indian children and more horses.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 22:29:32	@cloudyimages Someone should have told teenage me that earnestness does not work. Absurdism, apparently, does.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-09 23:37:53	Got to edit. Can't be bothered to edit. Better put the kettle on and settle in; going to be a long night.  #pdexposuresproblems
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-09 23:46:08	Fun fact: every @pdexposures episode for the last year has been edited while I play Skate 3. It's my little ritual. http://t.co/NV5b5gYUVz
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-09 16:26:58	@The_Old_Penfold Because it makes sense. Well, that and the fact you're secretly a communist.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-09 16:29:49	@The_Old_Penfold @marisawriting It's Stalin vs Trotsky all over again. Who's getting the icepick?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 01:30:21	@pacificYO @filmdevelop I strongly recommend you don't. It's not sturdy enough to make wings with and it'd be a bit of a waste.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 18:33:10	@adamsimonstweet @sq_peg_pinhole CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 18:37:05	I'm both amazed and surprised this shit fest is still going; somehow I've eradicated it from my consciousness. http://t.co/jDwPHjIY02
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 01:33:05	@amanda_raney @filmdevelop the biggest (read: only non-cosmetic) change is the control layout. Focus ring is a BIG improvement.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 18:55:03	@The_Old_Penfold I know that's what it is. That's why I hate it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 20:12:38	@HamishGill How very Stalinist of her.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-08 20:46:46	@HamishGill only if your friends start disappearing after they disagree with her.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 09:25:01	This came through to my @Pdexposures email this morning. Somehow, I don't think they've listened to the podcast. http://t.co/3TmoFJXaGt
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 10:46:40	@barneymccann wait, what - 240fps? Seriously?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 10:58:15	Every time I do my laundry my house turns into a @jimmyzworld84 merch booth. Love it. http://t.co/JSGf2GR8a2
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 08:54:20	@barneymccann the improvement is exponential.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 15:12:06	@lamlux It's depressing that people pay attention to these test scores. Where's the "how good the results actually look" score?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 15:14:34	@adamsimonstweet I have not seen that until now but I'm glad someone has written it. #egalitarianismnotfeminism
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 15:16:50	@lamlux @ben_innocent 
- Spends $$$$ on gear
- Photographs the cat
- Uploads heavily-compressed JPGs to only be viewed on tiny screens
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 15:17:33	@lamlux @ben_innocent 
Oh, I forgot:
- Spends more time arguing about DxO test scores and resolution than actually using the gear
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 15:21:03	@Ben_Innocent @lamlux Buys a Noctilux then complains he's not winning awards with his inspirational series of wide-open baby portraits.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 15:21:20	@lamlux @ben_innocent Oh, I know. Doesn't make it any less funny/depressing, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-10 13:02:47	@barneymccann It'll make my instagram skate videos approximately 2,000,000 times better. ALL THE SLO-MO
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 19:18:02	@lamlux I make a point of adding ridiculous tags to @Pdexposures posts. I thought no one'd see them until I realised they end up on Tumblr.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 20:25:25	@cloudyimages I'll be around on Saturday but I don't know how free I'll be. I might give you a call in the evening, perhaps?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 20:48:48	Feeling fuzzy; how close do I go with the crew cut? Grade 3, 2 or 1?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 20:57:09	@lenire @the_old_penfold But guys, I haz date on Saturday. Gotta look my best.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 21:01:55	@lenire @the_old_penfold as ever, thanks for the support, Simon.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 21:02:27	@lenire @the_old_penfold I have some skinhead friends who would really disagree with that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 21:04:37	@MarisaWriting @shellysometimes @lenire @the_old_penfold As if I'd date someone who wasn't down for the skinhead lyf.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 21:15:46	@lenire @the_old_penfold @shellysometimes @marisawriting Fuck off, you cunt. Who do you think I am?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 21:19:33	@lenire @The_Old_Penfold @ShellySometimes @MarisaWriting In case any of you needed a reminder... It's done. http://t.co/7s7fpPj8be
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 21:20:00	@lenire @The_Old_Penfold @ShellySometimes @MarisaWriting honestly, I have NO idea how I've been single this long.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 21:21:12	@The_Old_Penfold @lenire @shellysometimes @marisawriting I should mention that it's directed almost entirely at Simon, who isn't.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 22:58:08	@cloudyimages @beckwould @mswildthyme Yeah, I could do that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 23:00:53	@cloudyimages @beckwould @mswildthyme Bloody hell, mate. Asking a fair bit there, ain't ya?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 23:03:49	@ineedhelp2015 @cloudyimages @beckwould @mswildthyme Well, someone has to show your mum some affection, mate.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 23:05:36	@ineedhelp2015 @cloudyimages @beckwould @mswildthyme I like your top hat. It really shows off your best side.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 23:08:38	@ineedhelp2015 @cloudyimages Okay, maybe Cloudy IS a butt pirate. But what does that entail, exactly? You need to define bizarre insults.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 23:11:12	@cloudyimages @ineedhelp2015 I did not breach international law when boarding that butt... but I did give it a jolly rogering.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 23:11:41	@cloudyimages @ineedhelp2015 Also, look at this dog. Just look at it. http://t.co/muuXRYlBxL
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 23:14:30	@ineedhelp2015 @cloudyimages Seriously, mate. Look at this dog. http://t.co/hYrEGGKkKy
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-11 23:14:54	@ineedhelp2015 Are you looking at this dog yet? http://t.co/8zJEnPt68v
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-12 00:16:19	@ineedhelp2015 I hope you've looked at the dog by now. Because it's there. Right there. http://t.co/8PVxV676F3
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-12 04:42:00	@ineedhelp2015 I never get tired of this guy. http://t.co/UmbiwYqEau
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-12 01:28:57	That moment when the appointment you thought was at 2pm in the afternoon tomorrow is actually at 10:20 - eight hours from now. Urgh.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-12 09:25:08	@ineedhelp2015 ITS EYES BURN INTO YOUR SOUL http://t.co/qUioCyiwDH
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-12 11:45:31	@barneymccann Okay - check your emails. My pitches are in there. Let me know what you make of 'em!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-12 10:52:13	@ineedhelp2015 This is your regular reminder to look at the dog. http://t.co/XrN3leVGYf
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-12 11:10:45	@barneymccann Ha! Thanks, man. I've got a couple of considerably more complex things that haven't made it on there yet, too....
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-12 11:16:23	@barneymccann To be honest, we could do a freestyle video in one day - maybe two. All we'd need fund-wise is travel and your time.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-12 11:19:29	@barneymccann For what it's worth I've got two ideas/plans that I'd like to run with if you could make one of them work...

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-12 22:52:17	@amanda_raney I am a one man rangefinder pushing machine.... even on myself. I bought another Kiev today.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-12 22:52:46	@amanda_raney Oh, it's bloody BRILLIANT. Genuinely. I just have to hide it until I can film it. (I'm talking about skating, to clarify!)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-12 22:57:52	@amanda_raney It's been a borderline impossible goal since 2006. Physically demanding. Big step for me.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-12 23:01:49	@amanda_raney Largely shout celebratory phrases and call each other cunts, if I'm honest.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-14 21:14:56	@cloudyimages a ridiculous idea: is your roof solid and smooth enough to skate on? How much space is there up there?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-14 21:35:17	@cloudyimages yeah, that wouldn't be an issue. I'm thinking of controlled stationary stuff. Could I head up there with you at some point?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-14 21:36:58	@cloudyimages fuckin' rad. I might drop by next weekend if you're game?

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-15 01:42:43	@NMatosPDX BUT YOUR BOOK DISPLAY MAKES ME RAGEY

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-15 12:45:41	@adamsimonstweet NERRRRRRRD
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-15 12:45:55	@adamsimonstweet I repeat: NERRRRRRRRRRD
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-15 12:50:17	@adamsimonstweet Very true. but still.... NERRRRRRRRRRD
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-15 12:59:05	@adamsimonstweet It's a fantastic album. I often skate to it; so good.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-15 13:01:46	@adamsimonstweet Here's a slightly different tangent on the idea. https://t.co/OfX7SboEfx

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-15 23:31:01	@ajleaps Wait, I missed this. You broke your wrist? How?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 00:46:20	I have four SLRs lying around with film in. Some of them have had that same roll of film for over a year.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 00:46:38	Hell, I've carried around an SLR in my backpack for two months and not shot a single frame on it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 00:46:48	I don't know why I even own SLRs.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 00:48:25	I've never even finished a single roll in the OM-1 that I got 18 months ago. It's just sat there on frame 8, doing nothing.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 00:49:06	@amanda_raney @nmatospdx @ajleaps OOOH! Buy liquid emulsion and actually PRINT onto the cast! Do that!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 00:50:43	@jrphotographybc Yeah, that's not my problem. I can burn through film in a rangefinder. SLRs just don't inspire me.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 00:51:25	@jrphotographybc Somehow they change how I shoot, and I get the results back and just feel dissatisfied. It's never as good as my RF work.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 00:53:08	@jrphotographybc If TLRs weren't so big, I'd probably be the same. A Leica is much easier to carry.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 01:01:07	@jrphotographybc OM-1 and 50mm/1.8 Zuiko &amp; Pentax MX &amp; KX with four SMC Pentax-M primes vs Leica IIIf, Summicron 50, Summaron 35, Elmar 90.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 01:01:31	@ShellySometimes I want to just finish these rolls in what they started in then turn all my SLRs into lamps.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 01:02:16	@ShellySometimes Yeah. If anyone believes I'd ever do that they should put the crack pipe down.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 01:03:55	@lancekingphoto @mgagle auto-focus + auto-exposure = less considered, less critical shooting. Or is that just me?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 01:05:49	@mgagle @lancekingphoto I can understand that. Starting out with a TLR makes me appreciate each frame in a 36exp roll more.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 01:09:46	@IsaacLagarda Who knows? Too big, too bulky, mirror slap, constant razor-thin focus in the VF, general use and feel, all of the above?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 01:12:04	@IsaacLagarda Yeah, that's part of it. But playing with the OM, it definitely feels like it's the viewfinder. Hate it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 01:12:30	Guys, I just took a shot with the OM. Isn't that exciting?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 01:20:04	@IsaacLagarda Two systems: screwmount and M. Screwmounts are higher magnification, but separate viewfinder. Ms are combined, but lower mag.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-13 19:45:22	@jana_obscura @paulbarden Scala - as in the B&amp;W reversal film that can be developed as transparency? I never shot it, but know about it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-13 19:54:40	@flyinggazelle Okay, what on earth is with this Vert Yes Evil bullshit?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-13 20:02:59	@paulbarden @jana_obscura These guys are going to be your best option: http://t.co/uBKHipI90E I wouldn't want to DIY that one.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-13 20:03:24	@paulbarden @jana_obscura (assuming, of course, that you want transparencies, and not regular negatives.)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-13 20:12:33	@paulbarden @jana_obscura I'd argue that's a waste. You could probably get enough selling it for transparency use for 3-5 rolls of Tri-X.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-13 20:13:00	@flyinggazelle That may be so but it's the worst name for a shop I've ever heard!

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-14 18:57:33	@cloudyimages @isitthe80s yeah, that's zero adjustment. Cover the cell completely and see where the needle is. It should be EXACTLY on zero.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-14 19:06:36	@isitthe80s @cloudyimages No worries man. These old selenium meters are solid - much prefer them to modern TTL ones.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-14 19:18:39	@isitthe80s @cloudyimages Ah, I've got one of those lying around somewhere. I think @karligle has it right now, actually.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 01:20:25	@DrShitlord @marisawriting I SAW IT ANYWAY
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 01:21:19	The Leica version was much more convoluted but much more fun. http://t.co/NmkACWpkQS
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 01:22:19	@IsaacLagarda Yep - Leica I (which has no rangefinder at all) up to the IIIg (which has a bigger, fancier viewfinder).
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 01:26:26	@DrShitlord It's alright. I'm busy taking over-elaborate selfies for @marisawriting. You're safe.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 01:33:48	@ChrisFecio I just don't like other  people enough to share myself with them.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 14:16:14	@dominik_mrzyk That's not their target market and they have no interest in reducing their cachet or compromising their quality.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 14:16:36	@ujhphoto @eugenbaban @filmhasgrain @filmdevelop This depends strictly on the instant coffee. Not all of it is bad.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 14:18:29	@dominik_mrzyk Not going to happen. They've cornered a certain market. They can't compete with budget brands, but this works for them.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-16 14:19:35	Well, I WAS finding this oddly hypnotic. Damn gravity, spoiling all my fun. https://t.co/LrlB4m3Rfi

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-17 12:12:02	@dominik_mrzyk EXACTLY. And, amazingly, the meter works perfectly and the lens is immaculate. Bargain win of the year? Yus.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-17 12:15:02	@dominik_mrzyk it was much better than my first J-8M. Now I have a mint one I'm going to do a proper comparison.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-17 12:21:07	@dominik_mrzyk in short, very sharp. Very contrasty. Lots of punch. http://t.co/cEyNKlEHAQ
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-17 12:30:32	@dominik_mrzyk Don't. That's money that would be better spent on higher quality film, darkroom kit or a scanner.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-20 22:36:18	@dominik_mrzyk You'll buy it, complain about its shitty bokeh and how unsharp it is, then sell it again. Stop buying shit you don't need.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 00:03:16	@JeremyKruger @DrShitlord @dominik_mrzyk I should say I'm partially being flippant but both are just ways to piss money away.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 00:08:44	@JeremyKruger @DrShitlord also, know yr audience. @dominik_mrzyk is always complaining about lack of money and low quality results.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 00:09:00	@JeremyKruger @DrShitlord @dominik_mrzyk for him to buy a spinner would be the worst possible idea.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 00:18:50	@DrShitlord @JeremyKruger and it and the sprocket rocket hardly have the sharpest "lenses" available. @dominik_mrzyk would hate them.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 00:30:14	@yeknom @DrShitlord @JeremyKruger @dominik_mrzyk if I had a sprocket rocket I'd question how I'd ended up with one. Then smash it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 00:36:06	@DrShitlord @yeknom @jeremykruger @dominik_mrzyk Not enough smashing; needs more hammers.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 00:37:33	@DildoAaron @dominik_mrzyk Yes. Or, if you're on a budget, Horizon. Any Horizon would be better than a Sprocket Rocket... even a broken one.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 00:38:05	@yeknom @drshitlord @jeremykruger @dominik_mrzyk They do - they learn that it's fun to smash terrible plastic cameras.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 00:39:55	@yeknom @DrShitlord @JeremyKruger @dominik_mrzyk true... But that's a lesson people seem to struggle with for some reason.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 01:45:23	@JeremyKruger @DrShitlord @yeknom @dominik_mrzyk my ex had one of the Horizons. Surprisingly good cameras. The cheap one is noisy, though!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 02:49:15	@yeknom @cloudyimages I wasn't that impressed with Chivas. I think I had Yamazaki once - it was some expensive Japanese whisky, anyway.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 02:49:46	@yeknom @cloudyimages if it was Yamazaki - and it's possible it wasn't - it was really bloody good.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 03:09:53	@yeknom @cloudyimages my money's always on Aberlour. That's a stunning whisky.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 03:32:24	@NMatosPDX get some Final Fantasy in there, lad. http://t.co/wZS1GK7dUD
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 10:27:55	@jasonepowell @NMatosPDX I use my PSP for all my emulation stuff. It's almost the perfect solution. Love it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 11:27:56	@adamsimonstweet The most pathetic thing about that is the overly earnest twitterstorm that it's created. Jesus fucking christ.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 11:28:54	@adamsimonstweet I mean, seriously - some fucking perspective, please? It's not like they're raping kittens. http://t.co/AE5TxfiYZX
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 11:43:17	@adamsimonstweet No it isn't - not by a long way. http://t.co/bHDDUhqBXj
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 11:55:07	@adamsimonstweet Yeah, that sort of mistake happens all the time. Honest.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 13:05:43	Forgive the somewhat grim view of my leg, but does anyone have any idea what these weird lumps are? http://t.co/cQwuqNsfWW
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 13:22:20	@sunderland_andy nah. Soft and painless.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 13:24:20	@1jamiefoster @sunderland_andy because I've had them years. Not really concerned, just curious.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 13:27:28	@sunderland_andy makes sense. Not sure it's worth bothering a GP with, though.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 14:54:16	@NMatosPDX Probably have done at some point. Those lumps have been there for years, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 14:58:29	@AndrewGronow I like that. I like it a lot.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 16:39:57	@cloudyimages *50-50 fingerflip.

*No handed 50-50.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 16:40:56	@Beckwould Aye, that sounds about right. You can't see them when the leg's at rest.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 20:58:39	The first rule of #devclub is that you don't talk about #devclub. Unless it's with your split personality, anyway. http://t.co/hefACfflgp

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 21:32:26	@dominik_mrzyk hey, it's a good price! It's not a fair one, but it is good.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-21 22:22:04	Well, I thought my shin felt a bit battered. This is all from 45 minutes of learning one trick; freestyle HURTS. http://t.co/GRyNZusisR
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 01:39:10	@DrShitlord apart from the military industrial complex and the war economy, anyway.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 11:07:37	@davepnd Is your missus fave-cheating on you?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 11:10:31	@MarisaWriting @theadamgoldberg Provia, every time. More clarity, more luminous, but still more realistic-looking.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 01:07:37	@jasonepowell Leica digital stuff, on the other hand.... http://t.co/oL5eYOwW2w
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 01:12:58	@jasonepowell Exactly. If you want to be a financially sensible digital photographer, buy a Leica. High investment, good buy-out later.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 01:19:02	@jasonepowell I disagree; even if you buy new, you'll lose far less money than if you buy anything else new. Camera, car, computer...
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 01:22:54	@jasonepowell Oh, of course, but then the gamble is condition and lifespan. Is warranty &amp; service worth the 50% depreciation?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 01:26:47	@jasonepowell Isn't it? If you buy a IIIf for £250, a full overhaul is typically £125... an M3 is £450 and again, about £125/£150 for CLA.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 01:27:20	@jasonepowell Of course the amounts are greater, but the percentages are similar. And you get that box-fresh feeling!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 01:29:34	@jasonepowell I know, I'm merely playing devil's advocate. I just think people don't consider these things on the "high price" of a digi M.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 20:03:52	@FilmShooter66 @marisawriting @jasonepowell Urghhhhhh. I miss my Yashica D so much. That camera was fantastic.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 20:06:01	@FilmShooter66 @marisawriting @jasonepowell Agreed. It's better with a flash bracket, quieter to use, and less prone to failure.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 01:39:58	@jasonepowell But isn't that the point? Lenses, in particular, hold their value. Want new lenses? Sell yours and get all your money back.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 01:42:02	@DrShitlord Where was your outcry about Gaza? Those were USA-funded weapons used by a USA-funded military killing Palestinian children.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 01:43:39	@DrShitlord Basically, yes. Morally bankrupt, at least.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 01:45:47	@DrShitlord It's a shame because your country is beautiful and has some wonderful people... but the politics are horrendous.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 01:46:56	@DrShitlord religion and money: the two-headed beast.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 01:47:54	@jasonepowell @drshitlord "The USA" is not the citizenry; it's the political, economic, industrial machine. The citizens are just the cogs.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 01:51:20	@DrShitlord Don't fall into the trap of "government = evil". The core part of the problem is lobbying. Not government per se.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 01:53:57	@jasonepowell @drshitlord And where does that funding come from? Lobbying corporations. Not the populace.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-22 12:34:49	@ZDP189 I laughed because my dad is a computer technician who had the same problem when he made the switch. Bloody awful OS.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-22 12:35:47	@nwclark_ @ILFORDPhoto Yep, 70mm, used for motion pictures, I believe: http://t.co/LUvEfi2Jci
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 20:47:57	@viewfinder_m6 I just wish the 135 frames were a bit better. This is where external finders win out. http://t.co/BPxbWnonZc
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 20:49:12	@viewfinder_m6 35mm frames are probably the best I've ever seen. It'd make a great dedicated 35mm body. http://t.co/8mEhMD2R37
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 22:14:03	@cloudyimages @dominik_mrzyk There's no JPEG option. You're shooting DNG only. I assume white balance is auto.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 22:17:05	@cloudyimages @dominik_mrzyk The M9-P is the best digital camera I've ever used because it doesn't feel digital, and the M60 is better.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 22:17:53	@cloudyimages @dominik_mrzyk Seriously, an M9, M9-P or M-60 is the only way I'd go digital at all. Not sure about the M-240.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 22:19:08	I "invented" a new trick today - which is to say Rocco probably did it first in 1981, the jackass: https://t.co/Yf969QP77u
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 22:26:50	@jasonepowell I don't think @dominik_mrzyk has ever used an M9.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 22:49:28	@dominik_mrzyk @jasonepowell they'll fit on anything mirrorless, but nothing is quite like an M8, M9 or Epson RD1.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 22:49:37	@cloudyimages gone already? Bugger.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 21:44:37	@filmdevelop @yeknom @marisawriting I like heroin and barbiturates.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 18:12:52	@MarisaWriting @jasonepowell I tend to define Portra as "tumblr-bait" - it's that washed-out, dreamy look Tumblr kids love.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-25 10:52:29	@BPMonkey because Cameron is friends with the head honcho of Tesco, perhaps?

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 18:16:54	@ShellySometimes This is why I believe in #egalitarianismnotfeminism. also, #contentioustweet
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 18:19:02	@ShellySometimes Exactly. I've been in relationships with abusive women before. It's frighteningly common.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 19:09:07	@MarisaWriting @jasonepowell No, I just think it's a very specific aesthetic style that's overplayed.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 19:15:15	@MarisaWriting @jasonepowell Not a fan. I don't find the colours realistic or appealing.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-25 12:09:28	@ZDP189 Like that's even a question! Soviets copying a screw mount but using Zeiss specs because they had the Contax machines? FASCINATING.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-25 12:11:23	Whoa. @lenire just turned 30. THIRTY.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 19:17:41	@jasonepowell @marisawriting Just pale, overexposed C41.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 19:23:03	@jasonepowell @marisawriting Why bother? Fomapan 400 is cheaper and gives you great B&amp;W with less faffing about.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 19:24:59	@MarisaWriting @jasonepowell Velvia IS harsh. It's designed for high-saturation landscape work, and is useless for skin tones.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-23 19:29:58	@MarisaWriting What I'm trying to say is that Velvia is STUNNING. Just don't photograph people and you're fine: http://t.co/sUGuneGPo4

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 01:59:32	@MarisaWriting I like Google+ as a platform but there's not enough regular users in my social group. Ello might be for my flippant side.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:07:30	@MarisaWriting No, I think I'm done sharing photos. I see no point in it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:10:17	@MarisaWriting No, not really. I advocate traditional darkroom methods, am anti-scanning and pro-print. Why would I share digitally?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:12:08	@jasonepowell @MarisaWriting I have a couple of projects in various stages. This is my only portfolio. http://t.co/Co16GOLEkE
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:16:59	@MarisaWriting @jasonepowell I don't know if I want to share. Why would I? What's the point in doing so?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:17:56	@MarisaWriting @jasonepowell I spent YEARS putting stuff on Tumblr and Flickr. Why was I doing that? What did that achieve?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:18:25	@marisawriting @jasonepowell ...plus, it seems like a very piecemeal way to approach anything. There's no coherence, cohesion. Sloppy.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:18:52	@marisawriting @jasonepowell I started readdressing how I thought about that when I started doing a project I actually fucking cared about.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:20:06	@marisawriting @jasonepowell I put a shot from it on Flickr and then went "wait, why am I denigrating it in this ridiculous fashion?"
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:21:04	@marisawriting @jasonepowell If I believe in the value &amp; meaning of this work, doesn't it deserve more than this masturbatory like-seeking?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:22:16	@MarisaWriting @jasonepowell Imagine if Dorothea Lange debuted her Migrant Mother on Flickr. What a shitty way to show it to the world.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:24:41	@MarisaWriting @shellysometimes @jasonepowell Some people have been trying to get me to make a website. That's still a possibility.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:25:14	@MarisaWriting @shellysometimes If these photos are going anywhere, they're being carefully curated, not ejaculated onto Flickr in bursts.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:27:17	@MarisaWriting @shellysometimes @jasonepowell NO. I AM GOING TO SHOUT AND SWEAR UNTIL YOU'RE AS MISERABLE AND CANTANKEROUS AS ME.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:28:02	@MarisaWriting @shellysometimes @jasonepowell Oh, fuck off. You're making me want to vomit.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 20:38:11	Happy freestyler; that's Fairbro's blown away face. Best curry house I've ever seen... Ever. http://t.co/B4YZZxrstn
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 20:41:24	@ShellySometimes @samsnch Fake? Thank god for that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 21:38:21	@HamishGill Tatty but still very beautiful. The lens is good, too.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 21:40:08	Every time I use Terminal I feel like a computer god. Command line interfaces are like geek nirvana.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:52:46	@amanda_raney @MarisaWriting it was a reference to my increasing belief that blogging/photo sharing is a form of masturbation.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:58:14	.@amanda_raney @MarisaWriting if children are sexcrement maybe flickr is more like a drawer full of discarded wank socks.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 02:59:07	This is how I am feeling. Read into this what you will. I need to sleep. (Credit: pictures for sad children) http://t.co/lf9K8L0X0U
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 22:06:05	@jasonepowell I used to work in a CAD office. While everyone else slaved away with the GUI, I worked command line. So much more efficient.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 22:07:37	Picked up some new clothes today from @jimmyzworld84. Loving this tank top a bit too much. Now where's me Stella? http://t.co/cmyh5BaTtZ

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 21:56:56	Someone is having way too much fun. https://t.co/i1IbwSP0eY
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 01:49:08	@samsnch @ShellySometimes exactly. When the satire needs someone to flag that it's satire, the reality should perhaps be reconsidered.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 08:10:10	@Max_Resnick @samsnch @ZDP189 I'm just disappointed I was asleep for the entirety of it, but Sam did well. Good job, mate.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 08:13:15	@dominik_mrzyk what, this? http://t.co/L6yQ8Wi6ti
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 08:33:08	@samsnch That'd be fun - I'll pitch it to the lads.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 08:41:10	@samsnch Maybe a Jupiter 3 would be a better investment than another body?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 08:43:37	@samsnch If the 4AM works, keep it. Never sell gear that works to fund gear that might not. It's a fool's errand.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 01:57:42	.@mat4226 @jasonepowell still not sold on rangefinders? Yeah. I remember those days... Faintly. http://t.co/YGrZsP0slO
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 02:01:46	@mat4226 @jasonepowell it's been a gradual accumulation. The Soviet LTM stuff is what I used at uni &amp; I'm too attached to get rid of it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 02:03:49	@samsnch @ShellySometimes aye; I had a modern artist as a housemate for a while. I went to an exhibition of his and thought it was satire.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 02:04:01	@samsnch @ShellySometimes it wasn't.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 02:07:08	@jasonepowell @mat4226 not pictured: a Zorki 1 on loan to @karligle &amp; a Leningrad with a broken shutter &amp; RF; I'd still like a working one.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 02:08:29	@samsnch @mat4226 @jasonepowell that stack on the right is basically all I'd have if I started over... But maybe Zorki 5 instead of Fed 2.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 02:13:33	@samsnch this was my dream kit all the way through uni. I finally finished it... Then bought a Leica. http://t.co/D6CQdSx8e1
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 02:14:39	@mgagle @mat4226 @samsnch @jasonepowell if it's a 35mm system, have one backup body. Trust me.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 02:23:56	@samsnch you could easily go Leica IIIf, Kiev/Contax, Contax lenses + Amedeo adapter. Odd kit but it'd work.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 02:31:39	@samsnch simple fix. Done it to all my FSU rangefinders. It's just cut from self-adhesive flocking material. http://t.co/qxVQDt7yaf
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 02:36:25	@samsnch I don't know. It's almost like a firm felt. I use this: http://t.co/iNxxlnmu8o
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 02:38:19	@samsnch I still have yet to be able to test that theory and I've been using this stuff for two years.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 02:40:15	@samsnch eyecups just mean you're even further from the viewfinder - already a problem with glasses. Say goodbye to the edges of the frame.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 12:03:27	Gah. I had such high hopes for this stuff this weekend. http://t.co/iWcXxO9ROo
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 12:17:32	@dominik_mrzyk Just let out an involuntary lol. Nice film, but so, so easy to burn through.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-27 12:21:01	@dominik_mrzyk always.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 10:23:32	@dominik_mrzyk that TLR is 35mm. One of the few true 35mm TLRs, actually.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-26 10:26:28	@dominik_mrzyk heavy, expensive, overly complex, hard to get serviced. No you don't.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 19:29:11	@ShellySometimes which one was that?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 19:29:14	@MarisaWriting Say what?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 19:30:35	@patrickjclarke I might have to buy some film for mine this week. Or maybe some FP100C instead. Hmm....
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 19:33:16	@viewfinder_m6 Bloody hell. And so the collection continues... what's the full lineup now?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 19:36:23	@viewfinder_m6 You also need an MD, surely? And does this mean you've got an M7 now?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 19:36:34	@ShellySometimes Damn, sorry. I should have known that one was yours.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 19:41:20	@viewfinder_m6 You should try the Canon 7's viewfinder - surprisingly good frameline choices. Easier for me to see than the M2, too.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 19:49:43	@HolgaJen @marisawriting What can I say? I like to make sure what I'm saying has sufficient gravitas.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 19:50:14	@viewfinder_m6 I'm just overly critical - you've got to be. There's a lot of very similar options. But the viewfinder IS great.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 19:54:17	@viewfinder_m6 The edges of the patch aren't as well-defined but the brightness is good. Easily on a par with the average Leica.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 19:59:02	@yeknom @viewfinder_m6 Summaron? A 3.5 one is cheap and a 2.8 one should still be cheaper than the Zeiss.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 20:12:03	@yeknom @viewfinder_m6 My Summaron's full of haze, and flare is still minimum. Glow is at a maximum, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-28 15:01:13	Another stealth Simon Mroz selfie. This is a fun game. (See @jimbofairbro's from earlier) http://t.co/bxFAOLycuz
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-29 13:31:05	@yeknom mostly because the tactics take a long while to get your head around - particularly the bidding. Very deep and complex
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-29 15:16:26	@yeknom you say that but @cloudyimages is an old school sorta guy.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-29 15:18:24	@bibliosk8er you and me both, brother. All my back muscles are tense and taut today.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-29 15:26:51	@bibliosk8er I need a small Chinese girl on staff to massage all the knots out. I also need to spend less time talking to Mario.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-29 15:27:29	@yeknom @cloudyimages congratulations; this is the geekiest argument I've ever seen.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-29 15:29:20	@bibliosk8er you should see the PMs he sends me. They'd even make Silvio Berlusconi blush.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-29 15:45:52	@MarisaWriting yes - wouldn't let me into the user section a while back.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 20:15:05	@viewfinder_m6 @yeknom ...and even then it's at least one or two stops shy of a "proper" sunny day elsewhere.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 20:22:28	@yeknom @viewfinder_m6 Wimp.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-24 20:38:33	@viewfinder_m6 look at this lovely, uncluttered Canon 7 viewfinder. Needs a better subject, though. http://t.co/4HQrFqX6gN
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-29 21:36:04	@davidbazan New Headphones album for 2015?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-29 22:40:56	@cloudyimages Yeah, I'm with you. Too much wanky photography with no purpose or artistic merit (arguably myself included).
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-29 23:33:45	@amanda_raney Nah, it just sounds like you're a Derbyshire lass.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-29 23:36:47	@amanda_raney You did not, but well done!

104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-30 01:50:52	@bibliosk8er I didn't even know you had a dedicated longboard account.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-30 18:58:54	I just backed 100 More Years of Analog Film on @Kickstarter; can't wait to try out both the 120 &amp; 35mm films! http://t.co/1bcVFKt07K
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-30 21:09:10	@lamlux And it's in @Lenire's home state, too.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-30 21:12:44	@lenire @lamlux No! Not @ajleaps. She's been through enough. Why can't it have been on your doorstep? No fair!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-28 22:04:17	This happened today. I can't put it on Instagram because it might run in a magazine, but I think it's a great shot. http://t.co/dd3Q6MIzjo
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-28 22:04:50	Photo credit for that goes to Simon Mrozinzki, who's taken a lot of stunning photos of/with me lately.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-09-28 22:10:21	@isitthe80s no, that's ME. A friend took the shot. And yes, I did.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-02 03:52:53	@Ben_Innocent gah, skate contest fuckery. Almost travelled transatlantic for one and now I see the shambles it was I'm glad I didn't.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-02 04:04:08	@Ben_Innocent it's just a bit of a battle between traditionalists like me and piss artists who are fucking up the format to make it easier.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-01 14:07:11	@M_Star_Online Well, we've all known it for a long while; I'm just glad that @Channel4News are finally covering it.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-03 01:29:15	The problem with using facebook as a "pro skater": you get friend requests from people like this. #nope #delete http://t.co/9ijlISaCMt
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-03 01:29:40	And I'm just a lowly freestyler. I feel sorry for the guys on Street League and all that lark. They must be drowning in this bullshit.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-03 01:32:52	@JosephAschiero I don't exactly know, but apparently his swag level is through the roof.... Whatever that means.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-03 01:36:41	@JosephAschiero I had some ridiculous hairstyles as a teenager but I built them on postmodern irony. I think his involves a beaver dam.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-03 01:37:59	@JosephAschiero I remember when everyone had fauxhawks because of David Beckham, so I did two to take the piss. Not a solid choice.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-03 01:46:43	@JosephAschiero I went for the full punk spikes for a while, which morphed into a bizarre ska-fuelled arrangement I actually miss.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-03 01:49:22	@FilmShooter66 @ChrisFecio The YashD! So good. Great shot, great photographer, great film, great camera.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-03 01:53:42	@JosephAschiero a grown-out skinhead. I'd shave it all off again but it's the wrong time of year for that behaviour!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-03 02:16:20	@JosephAschiero you get the racist ones, and then you get the proper ones: http://t.co/y0HsoyT9Vg
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-03 02:16:52	@FilmShooter66 @ChrisFecio yeah, that's exactly how I felt about mine. It's got a certain something that the later crank wind models lack.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 00:23:09	Thanks, @Lenire. I'm going to be here all bloody night now. http://t.co/b9PvZefPfp
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 00:32:43	@ShellySometimes I love those frames! Still hate the teeny-tiny format, though. It's the 110 of the instant world.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 01:54:16	@lenire Last time I played this, there was nothing past the time machine. What is this bullshit?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 02:00:07	@ShellySometimes @lenire I actually ran the maths. If all you're doing is replicating the last top-level you bought, it takes 5 minutes.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 02:00:34	@shellysometimes @lenire But the jump to the next level takes almost TWO HOURS if you do nothing else.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 02:01:03	@shellysometimes @lenire (That's between time machine and Anti-matter).
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 02:03:14	@shellysometimes @lenire Just bought my first antimatter condenser. The jump to the Prism will take 7.3 HOURS of uninterrupted cookies.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 02:05:13	@ShellySometimes @lenire Yep. Maths. Ain't it great?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 02:10:57	@ShellySometimes @lenire Managed to drop it to 6.1 hours. But it's still a loooonnnnnnng fucking time to keep this running.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 02:13:18	5.96 hours! Wooo! #killme #killmenow
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 02:18:10	@ShellySometimes You were far too late for me, m'dear. I was gone before you even tried.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 02:52:16	@lenire @shellysometimes What. A TRILLION? Are these guys taking the piss? http://t.co/1AN8CPm07n
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 03:01:30	@lenire @shellysometimes I've got it down to 3.04 hours per prism right now. Can't stay up that long but I'll have so many cookies tomorrow.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 18:52:36	I think it's time to bring this geezer out of retirement. #believeinFEDs http://t.co/P0orghctzi
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 19:20:09	@jackthehatphoto Wow. Really digging deep for that tweet! But yeah, always had problems with Tri-X's curl, regardless of conditions.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-03 11:36:39	@RustyExcavator Don't let it get you down. It's obviously overcompensating for being made in an excavators-only factory.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 21:47:13	@OmarKenji which Zorki have you got?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 22:44:06	@cloudyimages @omarkenji I don't know, mate. A lot of the Zorki 4s and 4ks are preeeeeety unreliable.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 22:46:57	@cloudyimages I'm guessing it was this one as it's the only one that was horrendously underexposed on the roll: http://t.co/qwBE7SxATa
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 22:47:08	@cloudyimages Yeah, why the hell not. Sign me up.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 22:49:04	@cloudyimages Just try to pick a day that doesn't look like this one, yeah? Everything after this got stupidly hazy. http://t.co/SGNoD1JgOy
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-04 23:13:29	@cloudyimages IIIf, of course. Keep it Barnack!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-05 19:19:03	@viewfinder_m6 Ooof. That looks nice. Where did you get the Ardonal from?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 14:06:18	@andrewgronow @mattjacques (*without the slow shutter speeds. I are a idiots.)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 14:15:21	@AndrewGronow Yeah, that's pretty reasonable. I'd go for this one, though; note the focusing tab on the lens: http://t.co/Bl16UCimY9
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-05 20:45:04	@herdyshepherd1 I've noticed Sainsbury's have started running adverts on their milk. Perhaps their suppliers get a better deal?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-05 21:44:21	@DairyConsultant @herdyshepherd1 I suspected as much. I hope it at least stays that way - I still wish they gave dairy farms more, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-05 21:50:19	@DairyConsultant @herdyshepherd1 ROC? Return on.... cheese?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-05 21:54:00	@DairyConsultant @herdyshepherd1 Got ya. In your opinion, what's the most ethical source of milk on the high street?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-05 11:50:03	A prerecorded #freestyletricktip for your Sunday session - the M80. This is probably one of my… http://t.co/E1h2eKzFcd
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 20:00:03	@viewfinder_m6 nope. I'm never buying a camera or lens from eBay again. Nothing works properly from there.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 20:00:55	@MarisaWriting is that caffenol or just a bad scan?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 20:02:12	@MarisaWriting the shot's alright, but... Caffenol. Urgh.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 20:08:02	@MarisaWriting it's just not LC29/HC110/ID11/anything worth using. I find it a bit blergh.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-07 15:14:06	@jasonepowell @filmdevelop @carstheelectric Nope. Not even close to relevant. New55: legit new product. Cinestill: repackaging &amp; branding.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-07 16:14:13	@NMatosPDX It's for a company, not for me. Skimping isn't necessary. There's a budget, I just don't want to be taking the piss.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-07 15:57:38	Okay guys - need your help. Where can I buy a decent studio lighting setup for relatively cheap in London?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-07 16:09:00	@NMatosPDX I'm looking more for fixed lights than flashes or strobes.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-07 18:29:36	This is my new favourite thing; I wish Cosmo was actually like this. http://t.co/xokIcblccP
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-07 18:28:22	@D_Barlow_Photo @filmdevelop More to the point, would @ap_magazine care or write about it if you did? Probably not nowadays.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 11:09:12	Nothing makes me happier than a good hairline or extra-light font. Oooooooh yes.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 11:50:25	@AndrewGronow In what context?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-07 21:36:33	Favourite @NMatosPDX quote ever: "That, to me, is such a lack of not only professionalism, but even just giving a shit."
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-07 22:21:43	As a skateboarder, it sometimes feels like everything in the "real world" gets the volume turned down.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 13:32:33	@AndrewGronow IQ is the same - same lenses. What you've got to compare is feature set, ease of use and reliability.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 13:46:36	@AndrewGronow The smart money is on the Fed 2, Zorki 5 and Zorki 6 - similar bodies, reliable, cheap. Z5 &amp; Z6 lever wind, Fed 2 knob wind.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 13:47:14	@AndrewGronow Generally: Feds have dimmer VF with easier focus, Zorki are brighter, but not as contrasty RF.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 13:48:04	@AndrewGronow Steer well clear of the Zorki 4 and 4K and anything with a C/S in the name. All oversized and/or prone to failure.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 13:50:21	@AndrewGronow The nicest of both lines are the Zorki 3 and 3M - both gorgeous, both rare, both expensive as a result.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 13:52:53	@MattJacques @AndrewGronow exactly. Everyone goes for the 4/4K but they're unreliable oversized pieces of shit. Even a Fed 5 is better.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 13:59:09	@MattJacques @andrewgronow The other reason to make that choice would be Jupiter 8 over Industar 61 L/D. Both good lenses, but I prefer J8.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 14:05:09	@AndrewGronow @mattjacques Earlier ones have strap lugs, later ones don't. I'd lean towards an earlier one if condition is equal.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-06 14:06:01	@AndrewGronow @mattjacques (and avoid the late lever wind ones - they're Fed 3s without the self timer, and much bigger than a real Fed 2.)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-07 22:35:52	@MsWildthyme Maybe I should have said "everything that isn't skateboarding".
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-08 15:53:49	@jasonepowell BAHAHAAHA WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS https://t.co/62qoA8J3vO
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-08 17:35:34	@ShellySometimes @nmatospdx That was EXACTLY my reaction.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-08 17:36:32	@viewfinder_m6 Wow. That's a thorough service. What are they charging you?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-08 17:40:39	@viewfinder_m6 @samsnch Bloooooooooody hell.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-08 18:50:38	@dominik_mrzyk @tomwelland That's pretty reasonable for a Leica III.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-08 18:55:13	@dominik_mrzyk @tomwelland Early screwmount Leicas tend to cost more than later. Extra money for black. IIIc &amp; IIIf are tied for cheapest.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-08 18:58:13	@dominik_mrzyk @tomwelland looks tidy; you should treat yourself.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-08 19:02:02	@TomWelland @dominik_mrzyk JUST BUY IT
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-08 19:54:00	@ShellySometimes @filmshooter66 @susanclement1 If you're on the internet and you don't know what Goatse is, you have to hand in your router.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-08 20:08:57	@pdexposures Does that count as clickbait? Have we finally crossed that line?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-08 20:24:05	@SusanClement1 @nmatospdx If you need @Pdexposures to restore your faith in humanity something has gone very wrong with the world.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-08 21:01:05	@The_Old_Penfold @shellysometimes @jana_obscura @nmatospdx Send it to me and I'll do it. SMASHY SMASHY
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-08 21:03:33	@The_Old_Penfold @shellysometimes @jana_obscura @nmatospdx I think we should get together and make this a video episode of Pdexposures.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-08 21:34:05	@ShellySometimes Well, I'm sold. I'll take two.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 14:06:58	Anyone here have any experience with WooCommerce - and particularly Woo Jetpack - that I can tap into?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 01:21:59	@MarisaWriting get naked. Take selfies.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 02:04:26	@seecarlashoot @CineStillFilm @amanda_raney @filmdevelop cold, hard cynicism - in the way of analytical and critical thinking - wins again.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 02:12:20	@amanda_raney @seecarlashoot @filmdevelop @ShellySometimes any decent social media manager will be monitoring the use of their name.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 02:33:18	.@CineStillFilm @amanda_raney @seecarlashoot @filmdevelop But you're not a film company. You're a reseller pretending to be a film company.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 02:37:21	@samsnch @seecarlashoot @cinestillfilm @amanda_raney @filmdevelop I have a pressure washer and a lot of free time. Where's my $250,000?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 02:43:26	@samsnch @seecarlashoot @amanda_raney put 250ft of movie film in that and sell it as special effect film! #wheretheresgreedtheresaway
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 02:44:30	.@CineStillFilm but you're not manufacturing anything. It's a slight modification that doesn't warrant the amount you're asking.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 02:47:05	@MarisaWriting @ShellySometimes I wish you'd both come to England. #foreveralone
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 02:48:25	"Quick! To the Tweetdeck! People are saying negative things about our outlandish money-making schemes!"
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 02:49:24	@ShellySometimes where would we live? Texas or London? This is a crucial factor in my decision.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 02:55:36	@ShellySometimes huzzah! I would end up dying in that Texan heat, and I don't want to leave you as a widow.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:01:02	@NMatosPDX @MarisaWriting I cancelled my TV licence at the start of this month. Who needs TV now?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:01:51	Me right now: http://t.co/n81Migfqoe
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:02:58	@CineStillFilm @samsnch @amanda_raney @seecarlashoot @filmdevelop at $10 a roll, I'd call that bullshit of the highest order.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:04:08	@amanda_raney Because LOOK AT THAT FACE. I do love me a good twitterstorm.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:05:57	@MarisaWriting @mdintx Marisa, you need a new camera. May I suggest a Leica II?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:06:21	Wait, that backfired. Now I want a Leica II. Fuck.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:09:18	@Ben_Innocent @amanda_raney no. I save those for @MarisaWriting.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:12:29	Fun fact: this 1000ft roll of movie film will make at least 180 rolls of 35mm. That's 50p a roll. http://t.co/bnFeTGprjp
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:13:08	@samsnch I don't like the blanking plates on the late Leica IIs. I think they look weird. Nice to have flash sync, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:14:38	@samsnch the closest I can find is 😆.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:16:23	@MarisaWriting @mdintx get an Orion 15 for it from @dominik_mrzyk and you can take cool selfies too.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 22:29:58	@jasonepowell @shellysometimes Nope, not if the lens is good enough: http://t.co/fXSePfNj7v (the Voigtlander 21mm doesn't need one either)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 22:53:31	@lenire @ShellySometimes @jasonepowell Kockwell writes like a dick but his lens testing is thorough.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:17:23	@amanda_raney just, you know. Pointing out that they scalping people  and, until now, GETTING AWAY WITH IT.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:18:12	Here's another fun fact: that 1000ft roll is end-user price. If a company was really working with the supplier, they'd have a discount.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:19:07	So 50p a 36exp roll - which is a conservative estimate, as you'd get more than 180 rolls - is still higher than they're probably paying.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:20:31	Even when you factor in labour, rennet removal, film canisters, and those oh-so-important labels, it's basically a goldmine.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:21:41	Providing, of course, people don't actually point out how you're a greedy middleman and not actually a manufacturer or valuable service.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 03:23:17	I'd also like to point out my amusement that my phone seems to think rennet is present in motion picture film. #notveganfriendly
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 16:01:04	.@NMatosPDX Accidentally took the VIOOH out instead of the IMARECT today. God, that's a mistake I won't be making again.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 16:04:36	@jasonepowell @nmatospdx You're just making stuff up now.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 16:05:32	@jasonepowell @nmatospdx FOOKH off. It's all you need.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 16:07:34	@NMatosPDX It was the most disorientating experience I've ever had with a camera.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 16:11:29	@jasonepowell @nmatospdx Now you're talking my language.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 16:47:45	This is why having to buy gluten free cookies sucks: expensive and barely anything in the box. http://t.co/Gsm9i7QbAt
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 16:50:15	Also, this is a blatant lie. These things are softer than play-doh... And about as tasty. Disappointment all round. http://t.co/Ddptw96sCd
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 16:51:37	@Ben_Innocent by Tesco standards, but everything in Sainsbury's is better. Fact.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 16:53:12	Also, they make for poor dunking material, as they don't absorb enough. I rate this whole experience as a 1.5/10. http://t.co/VGY900zXM0
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 16:53:51	Next week on "It's miserable being a coeliac" I'll discuss the horrors of trying to find a decent breakfast cereal and cry a lot.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 16:54:51	@Ben_Innocent but waitrose is too high class for a commoner like me. It feels like I'm committing class treason when I go there.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 18:41:38	@jasonepowell ba-dum-tish. I'm glad someone got it, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 09:35:00	@The_Old_Penfold I was with you, brother. I've always thought they were robbing bastards.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 12:09:52	@barneymccann @the_old_penfold @sainsburys I have the same problem with EVERY greek salad I buy from there. It's annoying.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 12:16:56	@barneymccann @the_old_penfold @sainsburys Very good. The £3 meal deal with one is a brilliant low-cost lunch, too.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 12:44:18	@barneymccann @the_old_penfold I hope you've followed @sainsburys after all this - never mind those pretenders.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 13:15:40	@adamsimonstweet Nope. That's the point. Male rights is born out of arguing for female rights. Only a middle ground can fix the problem.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 13:17:58	@adamsimonstweet I actually hate both sides of the argument equally; I find them both vitrolic. I am a true egalitarian in that regard.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 13:21:50	@adamsimonstweet It might. But by fighting for one side, you embolden and enrage the other, creating your own opposition. It's a fool's war.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 13:22:50	@adamsimonstweet If you want gender equality, fight from that position, taking into account the needs of both genders.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 13:23:26	@adamsimonstweet Don't fly under a banner that - accidentally or not - suggests/creates primacy for one side then claim it's all-embracing.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 13:23:55	@adamsimonstweet The fact that you claim I sound like a male right's advocate when I'm coming from a neutral middle ground proves my point.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 13:32:10	@barneymccann @the_old_penfold I'll stick with the salad unless @sainsburys can supply some gluten-free goodness.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 13:33:22	@adamsimonstweet OH DEAR! My application of logic, semiotics and linguistics is lessened by my penis! Quick, to the surgical table.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 13:35:35	@adamsimonstweet No, it's jaded from every interaction I've ever had. Those experiences are the end result of your narrative and rhetoric.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 13:36:36	@adamsimonstweet Nope. Stalin was born out of Communism's clash against the Capitalist west. Feminism bore both Dworkin and "male rights."
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 13:37:02	@adamsimonstweet Any non-neutral position will both create its extreme and its extreme opposition.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 14:19:58	@samsnch Not bad. Impressive results for an f/3.5 in low light.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 14:22:55	@adamsimonstweet I'm assuming the use of phallus was a poor attempt at a joke and not just dyslexia in action.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-11 12:21:46	@MarisaWriting a batch normally lasts around 16 rolls. Just keep track and extend fixing time. http://t.co/3BdF4bNf1k
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-11 12:58:05	I swear to god that lately I spend half my day looking at this, trying to judge when I can go skating. Autumn sucks. http://t.co/gOBCZUnW0J
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 16:38:23	@samsnch My new favourite: "I need a high-res profile photo of you." "Okay, here's a link to my Instagram page."

....wait, what?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 16:45:44	@ShellySometimes @lenire http://t.co/v4lKnygPpN - also a nice story going on over there.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 23:13:44	@amanda_raney come and crash here! You can pay rent in (gluten-free) cakes.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 23:43:05	@cloudyimages OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE. You're as bad as @dominik_mrzyk. "Oh, this Standard 21mm combo is amazing!" then "I'm selling EVERYTHING".
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 23:44:02	@amanda_raney Depends strictly on where. London: £££££. Cornwall: £££. Bradford: £.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 23:44:58	@seecarlashoot @filmdevelop @amanda_raney Because it's just a respool/recut and a profiteering exercise, not a new film stock.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 23:46:45	@seecarlashoot @filmdevelop @amanda_raney Yes, very much yes. Anyone who's merely another middle man is a parasite, not a producer.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 23:47:09	@amanda_raney Living cost - rent aside - in Tunbridge Wells is fairly high. The South East in general is expensive.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 23:48:50	@seecarlashoot @filmdevelop @amanda_raney Unless you're actually contributing something quality &amp; new you're just attempting to make profit.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 23:49:15	@seecarlashoot @filmdevelop @amanda_raney We discussed ways of monetizing @pdexposures last year and respooling bulk film was one idea.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 23:49:43	@seecarlashoot @filmdevelop @amanda_raney We wrote it off straight away as it's a parasitic tactic to make money off people who don't know..
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 23:50:01	@seecarlashoot @filmdevelop @amanda_raney ...how to save money by doing it themselves. Then Cinestill appeared.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 23:50:22	@amanda_raney Trust me, the north is much cheaper. There's just far fewer jobs.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 23:52:50	@amanda_raney @ben_innocent It's cold, the beer is cheap, there's lots of racism and fighting, and the accents are crazy.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-09 23:58:18	@filmdevelop @amanda_raney @ben_innocent I think every time I've been to Brum I've almost got into a fight. Lovely place.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 19:54:47	@ShellySometimes A Nikkor 20mm? That's one hell of a present.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 00:50:42	My favourite hobby on GTA Online: driving on the left hand side of the road and shouting "I'M BLOODY ENGLISH" at everyone I pass.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 00:56:12	@JeremyKruger the Freeplay online is nightmarish. The amount of times I've been killed during a cutscene? Urgh. Jobs are fun, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 00:56:43	@JeremyKruger are you on PS3 or Xbox?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 20:56:06	@lenire Mein Gott. Your poor computer!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-11 19:30:31	One very clever spider has built a web right outside my window to catch the moths that fly into it. Good job, mate. http://t.co/SUAwABU9ts
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-12 12:04:41	@JuloPeter @pdexposures the bait and switch is my favourite trick.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-12 13:13:04	Stretching: now with 100% more involuntary wookie noises.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-10 01:02:42	@JeremyKruger agreed. It's alright when it's just people you know, though. Shame you're not on PS3. #TeamSony

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-12 20:54:12	@amanda_raney At that price, it's worth a try!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-12 20:58:19	@ChrisFecio Some people eat half a candy bar?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-12 21:57:05	@amanda_raney @dominik_mrzyk what MF SLR is it?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-12 21:58:53	@amanda_raney @dominik_mrzyk do you have any idea how unergonomic a kowa six is? Or how heavy and unwieldy the Pentacon six is?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-12 22:01:46	@amanda_raney @dominik_mrzyk a C330, while heavy, is a better and cheaper option than both. My Pentacon Six has only seen about five rolls.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 00:03:45	@ChrisFecio I ate all the tacos.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-11 18:15:45	@amanda_raney @filmferrania "Socialism and government intervention is EEEEEEEEVIL"
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-11 18:53:36	@amanda_raney no point. @ILFORDPhoto's 220 machine broke and was deemed too uneconomical to repair, so it was scrapped.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-11 19:01:21	@dominik_mrzyk could well be. It's on Facebook, too.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-11 19:02:19	@amanda_raney @ILFORDPhoto you and me both. It's daft that Kodak are one of only two companies with a 220 machine and they're wasting it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-11 19:21:40	@MsWildthyme @dominik_mrzyk and that, folks, is how I really met @cloudyimages.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 00:34:30	Nice to have a reminder sometimes. #depressionlies https://t.co/wl7ehmrMJ8
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 01:06:27	Just found this expired film in a drawer; best C41 film I've ever used. Bring on the fresh @filmferrania stock! http://t.co/5zLAYiReFf
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 01:10:20	.@lancekingphoto I've never used @filmferrania's E6 film - I'm a Fuji guy for E6 - but this stuff was great. 12exp obviously wasn't enough.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-14 15:48:47	This package has been "out for delivery" all day. I am sick of bloody waiting now.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-14 15:58:03	@ChrisFecio I've wasted a full day now. It's ridiculous that we still have to do this with the wonders of modern technology.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 17:47:42	@amanda_raney a comparison: cold, wet and humid. http://t.co/MUz7sPdUnH
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 17:48:55	@amanda_raney Welcome to England, where damp permeates EVERYTHING.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 17:50:45	Expecting a new video from @FSLateTricks tonight... which means pressing Ctrl+F5 on their Youtube page relentlessly.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 20:05:43	@jasonepowell because look at the amount of extra typing! What a faff. But yeah, it's mostly just that it's what I know &amp; I have to relearn.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 20:06:15	@jasonepowell WP. Actually, can I tap you up for advice re. woocommerce? Got a problem I can't solve.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 22:49:49	@gregcreates @f8creates I feel your pain, mate. Good luck!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 22:55:36	You know, I always thought people who tried passing off inkjet prints as "Giclée" prints were wankers. http://t.co/op1yfB7Wf5
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-14 18:20:36	@amanda_raney I just vomited in my mouth a little bit.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-14 18:30:12	@JuloPeter @amanda_raney it's a surprisingly good combination - on a TLR, at least. http://t.co/HZMQUPM0rT
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-14 18:37:18	@amanda_raney @julopeter It could work for that. I've used it for portraits in the past.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-14 19:10:33	@myhermes I've been waiting for 5622177247470185 all day. I need that package for a business trip tomorrow. Is it ever being delivered?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-14 01:27:19	@anteksiler Trying to build a store using your UberStore theme; why are the product previews pulling gallery images and not featured ones?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-14 01:28:04	I need to go to bed. If I start at PHP any longer I'll go mad.

(Important info: I don't know any PHP.)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 17:51:15	(It's actually Cmd+R but that's not as well-known a keystroke.)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 17:52:19	@amanda_raney Survival techniques for Brits include football, alcohol, sex and (for the nerds) videogames. I will not say which I favour.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-15 02:12:06	Weird mess-about #freestyleskateboarding video for @bibliosk8er. Filmed at midnight, rendered at 3am,… http://t.co/KXWPhVbSgo
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 19:12:18	@annalisedevries @BwrightPhoto @freshstylemag Nope, not even close. A reboxing of currently-existing motion picture film.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 19:17:11	@annalisedevries @bwrightphoto Not really. Remjet removal is fairly minor &amp; commonly DIY'd. This is more a marketing exercise than anything.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 19:17:52	@annalisedevries @bwrightphoto Case in point: https://t.co/uSeWKIhpfF 

Cinestill didn't invent the film or process, just branded it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 19:27:26	@annalisedevries @bwrightphoto Even so, this isn't a new film stock, just marketing hype - and their kickstarter perfomance reflects that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 19:27:57	@annalisedevries @bwrightphoto Even more galling was their release of Kodak's Double-X as a "new film" - despite the TOTAL lack of remjet.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 19:35:13	@annalisedevries @bwrightphoto Nope - it's just another middle-man link in the chain, skimming profit by charging too much per single roll.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 19:36:26	@HamishGill @f8creates Can I make an observation? That nav bar at the top takes up WAAAAAY too much of the screen.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 19:38:45	@HamishGill @f8creates Firefox, 13" Macbook. It'd probably look fine on a new iMac but 1/5th of 13" doesn't leave much.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 19:44:47	@HamishGill Nope; this is what I end up with. http://t.co/YoUhHocCre
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 19:49:41	@HamishGill @jasonepowell I don't mind persistent navbars providing they don't impact the actual visibility or performance of the site.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 19:52:03	@HamishGill @jasonepowell For what it's worth, I feel your pain. I've inherited a website to redesign and it was in a right mess.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 19:52:47	@hamishgill @jasonepowell Last time I did web design, I didn't have to consider such a range of devices &amp; screens. It gives me a headache.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 19:55:09	@jasonepowell @hamishgill Tell me about it. Last thing I did used frames and tables and written in notepad. CSS was basically unheard of!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 19:57:58	@BwrightPhoto That's a nice sentiment, but $10/film is neither sustainable or attractive. It's not going to help the film market in any way.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 19:59:45	@jasonepowell Agreed - but it's like having to relearn everything from scratch. &lt;center&gt; doesn't even exist anymore. What's that about?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 20:13:04	@jasonepowell Argh! Can't send a link via DM but can't send the link publicly. I'll screenshot &amp; explain. One sec.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-13 20:20:18	@jasonepowell Okay, email is on the way. Thanks for having a look, mate. This has been making my head hurt for a couple of days.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-15 11:53:56	@MsWildthyme free labour followed by removal from the gene pool, perhaps? The rhetoric sounds vaguely familiar, anyway.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-17 08:38:53	@samsnch Sam, I could kiss you for bringing this fact to my attention. You've just made a car full of skaters very happy.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-16 01:07:31	@ShellySometimes @lenire yeaaaaah. I know.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-16 02:26:02	Staying at my parents' place for a few days. Found my old journal from when I was 15. I wrote like a crazy person.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-16 02:29:24	I never did find out who wrote this in the school paper. http://t.co/WJpGODH9cr
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-16 02:37:09	@amanda_raney I wish! Now I have to deal with the fact some girl in my school had the hots for me and I was too busy skating to know.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-16 02:40:24	@amanda_raney I bet it was @hagleybob. I think Twitter can finally solve this mystery.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-16 02:43:41	@amanda_raney @jasonepowell thankfully, my mum can't write for shit, and didn't know how to use a PC back then. We can rule her out
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-16 02:48:05	@amanda_raney I'm going to snuggle up with this beast and everything will be okay. http://t.co/2245HbE72b
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-16 02:49:28	@samsnch high school newsletters. Of COURSE comic sans.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-16 02:50:06	@jasonepowell @amanda_raney the lens is good, but the whole thing is so unwieldy. Also, broken. Bad shutter - common problem.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-16 02:50:54	@amanda_raney take it from me: it is an unwieldy, heavy, awkward, unreliable tank.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-16 03:03:36	@jasonepowell @amanda_raney I'm going to see how much it'd cost me to get it repaired. I can't see me using it much but I might as well.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-17 17:10:58	I learned to do frontside rock and rolls today. Considering I never skate ramps, I'm pretty pleased… http://t.co/4NCqdSrmBw

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-19 02:40:50	@MsWildthyme @cloudyimages nope. I even wrote my mother a note saying "please stop smoking. I don't want you to die" when I was about four.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-19 02:41:11	@MsWildthyme @cloudyimages neither of them will ever stop or moderate.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-19 02:50:51	@cloudyimages @MsWildthyme pipe smoke doesn't bother me, and I think the problem is the pervasive and persistent nicotine in my environment.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-20 16:43:52	@jasonepowell exactly that. Lots of heroin floating around in these parts.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-20 16:49:34	@jasonepowell last time I was here I called into a public toilet and found a blood-filled syringe in a cubicle. Grim.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-20 20:17:12	@bibliosk8er it's a terrible idea if you're a freestyler. I had an iPhone 5s for a while. After a few 360 fingerflips it wouldn't unlock.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-20 20:21:19	@MarisaWriting breeding is just a biological trick; a rejection of intellectual positions in favour of giving yourself over to your genes.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-19 12:28:38	@cloudyimages yes and no. He fixed the slow speeds perfectly, but I'm not convinced 1/1000 is giving me an even exposure.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-21 23:51:47	On one hand, it's nice to not be editing furiously at 1am before the @pdexposures deadline. On the other... it's @lenire. Oh god.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-21 23:53:13	@lenire WELCOME TO MY HELL. We don't get enough music submissions.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-21 23:59:23	Note to self: reading about Numbers Stations for hours when you live alone will only mean cooking dinner at 1am and being very freaked out.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 16:34:04	@ChrisFecio @mgagle Can I join in? http://t.co/WfLs149DJ0
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 16:34:42	@lenire Sounds like they need some monkey-fighting snakes on that monday to friday plane.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 16:35:55	@samsnch OOOOOOH! Good choice. Also, weirdly envious; I remember when I first got mine - and saw the first results. It's an exciting moment.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 16:36:32	@ChrisFecio @mgagle I LOVED that hat. So much so I managed to disintegrate it with sweat over three consecutive years.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 16:36:58	@lenire @chrisfecio @mgagle We all had teh long hairz. And we all looked awful.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 16:56:18	@ChrisFecio @ajleaps @lenire @shellysometimes @mgagle Shave it all. https://t.co/blLAAHZiGN
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 16:56:48	@samsnch Good price! Get a UV on there to protect that front element ASAP.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 16:57:48	@samsnch You want to pick up the collapsible barn door hood. Those things are AWESOME.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 16:58:49	@samsnch SOOFM.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:03:54	@samsnch looks ridiculous, but so efficient. And folds flat! http://t.co/H1xmUcH8bF
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:04:22	@samsnch See? Flat. http://t.co/QKccvDBTsH
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:05:59	@samsnch They're typically around £20 here. £15 if you're lucky. The later rigid circular hoods are £35 - £50 for comparison.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:09:22	@samsnch Ask http://t.co/gvoebLITf5 if they'll ship to you? Bargain prices.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:09:42	@cloudyimages You think @parcelforce are bad? Hermes are a million times worse.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:10:09	@ShellySometimes @lenire The only camera debate I care about is Leica vs Contax.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:14:11	@ShellySometimes @lenire I'm stuck in 1938.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:18:33	@samsnch See, bargainous.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:20:02	@samsnch I have no idea. You'd have to email them.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:27:41	@jasonepowell BUT LEICA LENSES HAVE THAT MAGICAL GLOW AND BETTER TONAL CONTRAST
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:30:21	@jasonepowell BUT CONTAX BODIES ARE OVERENGINEERED AND OVERPRICED AS A RESULT
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:30:45	@jasonepowell @shellysometimes dude. just.... dude.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:31:19	@jasonepowell Breaking character: The irony is that Contaxes were considerably more expensive than Leicas.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:34:34	@jasonepowell From 1936:

Leica III f2 Summar £39.10.0
Leica IIIa f2 Summar £43.0.0
Contax w/ f1.5 Sonnar £56.5.0

Ouch.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:36:51	@lamlux @jasonepowell Contax did not fare well as a system after the war.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-22 17:43:52	@jasonepowell Quality hand-machined goods has always cost substantial money unless there's state intervention and control (see: Kiev).
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-20 20:18:10	@MarisaWriting A CYNIC APPEARS: motherhood doesn't make you a superhero. It just means you've fulfilled your biological imperative.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-23 12:05:41	@Bapteash @filmdevelop Agfa Scala was designed for that, but the DR-5 process from http://t.co/uBKHipI90E will work for most films.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-23 12:27:59	@Bapteash @filmdevelop Yeah, DR-5. That's who you want to send it to. They're based in the US and apparently the best film for them is HP5+.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-23 15:47:55	@paulbarden @NMatosPDX believe me, there's no real difference. The only benefit of the yashica mat is the wider range of speeds &amp; better VF.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-23 00:37:37	@ShellySometimes That's the worst kind of lie, and the cruelest thing someone can ever say to you.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-23 17:08:29	@paulbarden @nmatospdx I've owned a Yashica A, D, 24 and 124G. The highlight was the D, to be honest. Great setup on that model.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-23 17:30:24	@paulbarden @nmatospdx Yeah, it's a good summary of the line. My only addition is that the D is the best TLR for use with a flash bracket.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-21 17:32:29	@ujhphoto Contax G system. That's AF, right/
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-23 10:08:14	@paulbarden @NMatosPDX @pdexposures I actually have the A. It's Spartan and basic, but it makes amazing images.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-26 15:12:41	@samsnch yeah, that's what I meant. 11 time zones for one country boggles the brain. And train times are standardised to Moscow time? Jeez.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-26 23:34:17	@amanda_raney basically, yes. How would you pronounce it?

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-27 01:16:39	@ajleaps @lenire @mgagle @DrShitlord @NMatosPDX to be the first half of the day after a long day of my friends are so cute I can't even see

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-28 03:05:15	@patrickjclarke Agreed. Every JtB album is a winner. I think Jawbreaker's a bit hit or miss... but then I like Dear You, so what do I know?

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-25 20:52:23	@lenire And like him, no one listens to you. (You'd probably even spell that as noone, now I think about it.)

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-28 00:09:43	So. I went out and socialised with normal, non-skating southerners. What happened? I got all angry, working class, northern and punk. Sigh.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-28 00:10:23	I think I swore a lot, too. It is a programmed reflex. I can't control it.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-29 13:30:50	@dominik_mrzyk Here's another old classic:
"When is a door not a door?"
"When it's ajar!"

HURHURHUR
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-29 13:33:29	@dominik_mrzyk Yeah, that involved a bit of wordplay. Let's go for another classic: How do you stop a skunk from smelling? Hold its nose!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-29 13:35:45	@ArneKuilman @dominik_mrzyk I like that. It's a proper "dad joke" - cheesy and silly.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-29 13:43:56	.@dominik_mrzyk Musician jokes are my favourite. How do you know when there's a drummer at your door? The knocking slows down over time.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-29 17:42:13	On one hand, the site going down means I don't have to do any work to it. On the other hand, it means it's still no closer to completion.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-29 14:03:42	@dominik_mrzyk Okay, try this one: How do you confuse a drummer? Put a sheet of music in front of him.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-29 14:14:55	@dominik_mrzyk It's very common. As a coeliac (allergic to wheat), I can't go anywhere near a Subway. They pipe the smell to the front door.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-31 03:53:27	@bibliosk8er This is one of those things where I can't tell if it's parody or from a real right-wing Christian group.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-31 03:55:50	@bibliosk8er The ebola virus image.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-30 19:29:17	@Beckwould I'm shit scared of it too. I did a rock to landing on my back in the flat on Swad's mini ramp years back. Fucking horrible.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-30 21:45:30	@Uncl3Rick @beckwould DO IT! Longboarding is so smooth and stable. It's a great way of getting around.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-30 21:55:35	@Beckwould @uncl3rick Get on it. They're so much fun. I bought one in 2009 and have covered so many miles with it over the years.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-30 22:53:27	@Beckwould I know. The problem is that I know what I like in a longboard. Something a LOT cheaper would probably suit you.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-30 20:18:31	.@Sekondosis Honestly, I don't talk to you for ages, and then one mention of my arse and you crawl back out of the woodwork.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-30 20:33:09	@lancekingphoto @filmdevelop I have never had Moxie before, but I feel we may have had this discussion already.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-30 21:03:55	Sometimes it feels like managing incoming messages across SMS, Twitter, FB, email etc. is overwhelming. Remember when we just had phones?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-30 21:04:43	Part of me misses the days when you could lie around listening to a record without something else bleeping for attention every five minutes.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 18:18:01	@samsnch Sam, for the love of god, please stop retweeting so much goddamned football stuff.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 18:31:54	I genulol'd.  https://t.co/GFrPqMe36y
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 18:33:42	@NMatosPDX i take it that is now yours? Because that is a bloody bargain.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 18:41:21	@NMatosPDX What made you pick up the Imarect as well? Do you think you'll use it? I quite like mine, oddly.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 18:48:50	@NMatosPDX So what lenses do you have in screwmount these days?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 18:51:52	@NMatosPDX Time to go Summar hunting.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 18:54:06	@NMatosPDX why not have both? You have the Imarect for it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 18:55:31	@The_Old_Penfold @NMatosPDX I'll have to contract you to bring me sone stuff back at those prices.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 18:58:24	@The_Old_Penfold @NMatosPDX pinholes? Me? It's like you don't know me at all, Alex.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 18:58:53	@NMatosPDX how would you do that permanently? And WHY?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 19:00:42	@NMatosPDX mount the lens on an m camera and I'm sure it'd unscrew.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 19:37:11	@NMatosPDX @The_Old_Penfold yeah, I know. But I was reading about the Ur-Leica and it's made me want a Standard again.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 19:40:16	@cloudyimages I've had a series of great deals and top-notch gear from them. They just hate you because you're an arse to them.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 19:43:21	@cloudyimages have you seen what a IIIc NORMALLY looks like? The chrome on those is normally pitted to hell. That thing's near mint.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 19:48:29	@cloudyimages Red Dot are charging more for worse. Check the pics: chrome damage AND bad vulcanite. http://t.co/ODClTfJ5A8
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 19:50:09	@cloudyimages Oh, wait. That's a standard IIIc, not red curtain (which equals more £). Standard IIIc, cracked vulc: http://t.co/tDCh9nruyx
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 19:52:16	@NMatosPDX @the_old_penfold The only place I can find one right now is Red Dot and they're taking the piss: http://t.co/TAbkDmbs5K
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 19:54:09	@NMatosPDX @the_old_penfold No, that's a fucking terrible price. Red Dot overcharge for everything by a huge amount.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 19:56:39	@adamsimonstweet @cloudyimages What a bargain! (Seriously, though. Misidentified but properly cheap.)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-30 22:17:53	@Beckwould @uncl3rick Boom: http://t.co/hs3AYoItJW
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-31 02:00:24	@FilmShooter66 Fun fact: studies show religious belief decreases in a country as education increases. Wonder what that says about the US?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-31 02:16:52	@Wakingmist Yes - very much so. I've got this whole show playing while I work. It's fantastic.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-02 02:45:16	@DrShitlord @jakeonfilm Because it's old news? Some of my uni friends were doing it in 2009. FIVE YEARS AGO. Keep up.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-02 02:46:37	@DrShitlord @jakeonfilm Because you've been out the game for too damned long? #bringbackJBPhoto
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-31 03:52:53	The new Jimmy'z site is starting to come together... with additional help from @cloudyimages. http://t.co/2bByGiEZEO
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-31 03:55:01	@bibliosk8er @cloudyimages That shirt's great. They do some reaaaaaly good raglans and longsleeves. Soft and comfy goodness.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-31 03:57:22	@bibliosk8er Thank Christ for that. (hurhurhur, irony, etc.)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-31 16:06:42	Having an interesting #freestyleskateboarding session; I love the aesthetics of these single kicks but… http://t.co/G0sDghnGLb
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-31 17:23:03	Ah, Halloween. The one day of the year when door-to-door begging isn't frowned upon and children are actually encouraged to be little shits.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-31 17:40:56	@filmdevelop Yes. I am going to stay in, drink coffee, put Fugazi albums on far too loud and scowl at anyone who comes near the door.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-31 23:37:55	@NMatosPDX What would I review?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-10-31 23:46:03	@NMatosPDX Would I have to do a bloody arduous animation job for each one?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 00:07:54	@NMatosPDX What, and release it as a podcast?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 00:52:19	The flip to #casper looks impressive but it's a million times easier than the gazelle. #freestyleskateboard... https://t.co/mx1P1PRYbg
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-02 12:47:30	Nothing quite like getting up on a sunday to find the foot you broke two years ago has chosen to suddenly play up again. Thanks, you dick.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-02 13:00:23	@DrShitlord Well, I have been eating a LOT lately, so....
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-02 13:04:02	Has the boulder fallen back down the hill yet?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-01 03:11:19	@cloudyimages MW just got one of those funky Kontur finders in - the 1:1 opaque 50mm finder? £10. Bargain.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-02 17:26:57	@lenire I'm on my way! Put the kettle on.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-02 17:44:08	@lenire I'M HAVING A PISS.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-02 19:44:26	Might have spent most of today's recording swearing and talking about wanking; @ShellySometimes might have to break out the notepad again.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-02 22:19:32	I thought I was GAS-free but I just wrote something that's led to me craving a Moskva-5 again. @dominik_mrzyk, where are you?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-02 22:24:02	@dominik_mrzyk Very good of you. I don't need one and my enlarger will only do 6x6. But I waaaaant one.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-02 22:27:02	@dominik_mrzyk Haha, not much. I'd be better buying some film for the TLRs I love and rarely use.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-02 22:30:02	@dominik_mrzyk Out of curiosity, I found one on eBay here for £50 delivered. Could you beat that?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-04 21:50:07	@jonasx70 the Soviet Image. Great book.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-04 01:44:43	@filmdevelop @amanda_raney @jasonepowell vegas sucks and the salads were disgusting. I'm too busy to say anything else. Vegas is horrible.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-04 23:42:40	@adamsimonstweet looks like shit compared to the FP100C IMO. How you feeling about it?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-05 13:12:51	I might have inadvertently started a relationship with a girl who doesn't like curry. I have never felt more conflicted in my life.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-03 13:18:33	@MsWildthyme eee, what sort of northerner are you? Wimp.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-03 15:25:11	@amanda_raney @lenire It does, doesn't it? The problem with writing these things is it awakens GAS you've never had.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-03 15:31:24	@amanda_raney @lenire you'd jump on anything, you hussy.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-03 19:37:07	Following @lenire's LC-A 120 review, he challenged me to find five cameras I consider a better buy. Here's my list: http://t.co/Q7y77FbOAX
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-05 14:09:07	Come on, Internet. I've got deadlines I'm trying to avoid and you're not doing a very good job of distracting me. Don't let me down now.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-04 17:34:16	I've been overcompensating for my lack of sleep with copious amounts of caffeine and now my heart feels funny.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-04 17:37:16	@ajleaps Hmm... I'm editing the podcast now. All of a sudden everything makes sense. &lt;3
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-04 17:45:07	@bibliosk8er Last night was particularly sleepless.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-04 18:32:28	@dfdy_ I send you warm wishes of hugs and empathy.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-04 18:47:28	I just realised @RustyExcavator has been worryingly quiet lately. I hope it hasn't seized up completely and given up the ghost.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-04 18:51:49	.@jonasx70 I have a feeling you're really going to enjoy something in tomorrow's @pdexposures podcast.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-05 16:33:35	@NMatosPDX @pdexposures but WHAT IS THAT HAT?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-05 16:35:15	@NMatosPDX @pdexposures but you weren't cycling....
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-05 17:05:47	I've just been told by a beautiful lady that I'm "calming". 

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, etc.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-05 17:06:30	@amanda_raney is this my doing or a coincidence?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-05 17:07:20	Okay. Now I'm being hit with things. This is more normal.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-05 17:57:26	@samsnch I've been trying to tell her that and she won't believe me.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-05 17:58:30	@samsnch apparently so, but I have no idea why.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-05 18:18:25	@lenire I'm not sure what's more amusing: @nmatospdx's singing or our surrealist aside and his annoyance.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-05 18:19:39	@ShellySometimes Have you been keeping track of the swears this episode?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-05 19:05:27	powell_peralta put out #propaganda in 1990. Why is this still a problem? #skateboarding… http://t.co/hjYGnIUBER
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-05 19:10:23	People who charge money to take others on a "photowalk" can go fuck themselves.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-05 19:12:48	@lenire Someone local to me who I'd not heard of until five minutes ago. Greedy bastard.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-05 19:37:00	If you've not listened to today's @pdexposures you're missing an @ajleaps guest spot and a lot of talk about wanking: http://t.co/MucOg19pzZ
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-07 02:24:48	@sunnivaj Do they have any tropical diseases in Colombia? Because if they do, I hope you catch them all.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-07 02:57:11	And if I sold my soul for a bag of gold to you, which one of us would be the fool - which one of us would be the foolish one?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-07 02:58:59	News just in: corporation that once created a friendly PR face upset the Twitters; petty Twitterstorm ensued.

Tomorrow: More of the same.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-07 03:00:08	@jasonepowell Obviously @pdexposures, @pinholepodcast and @PlasticImagery. If you've already listened to them, listen again.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-07 03:00:43	@sunnivaj Lengthy suffering, yes. Survival? Not so fussed.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-07 03:57:08	I may have been drinking and troubleshooting for four hours. I may also be resisting the urge to tweet meaningless profanities. Fridays, eh?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-07 04:28:29	My face IRL after half a bottle. I'm not always an angry cunt, see? http://t.co/nidIFh4qcl
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-06 01:09:59	I am going to refrain from these sickening tweets as much as possible. But back massages AND having coffee made for me while I work? &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-06 01:10:30	I am just waiting for something to go hideously wrong. Nothing ever goes this well for me.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-06 01:22:55	@JeremyKruger No, I've seen that one. God showed it me in a dream once. It involves much more raining fire.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-06 01:25:03	@JeremyKruger If Ben Affleck appeared while I was sleeping that'd probably clarify as a night terror.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-07 09:07:20	@samsnch @jasonepowell @ShellySometimes as someone with a brain and a low tolerance for bullshit, I must argue against that recommendation.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-06 01:31:06	.@ellacumber I know, right? I am being spoilt. There is no way this can last.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-07 17:29:51	I don't do #ff but being as @Sekondosis' tweets have just had me genuinely crying with laughter, go follow him.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-08 00:51:08	@falseverdict that's fantastic. Where can I get one for @Sekondosis?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-06 17:35:42	@samsnch A black Leica II would be lovely.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-06 22:20:01	"Going for a quiet #skate" doesn't always mean "learning a new #casper trick" but it's nice when it does. https://t.co/ZDTbDSDal8
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-06 23:20:15	@patrickjclarke Hell no! Etnies Santiagos. I try to only buy shoes from skater-owned companies.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-08 19:13:14	@ChrisFecio @DrShitlord @Peapodcaucaux me being me, I prefer #shitpea
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-06 23:38:18	@filmdevelop The fact that 6 out of the 7 first sentences in that press release end with exclamation marks make me want to punch someone.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-06 23:38:57	@patrickjclarke Mmmm... Ankle protection. Considering the state of my ankle bone, they look really good right now.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-06 23:44:49	@patrickjclarke Yeah, that's pretty much it. I'm fairly certain I've chipped the ankle bone on my right foot, though. Quite painful.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-06 23:59:38	@patrickjclarke Yeah. I hit it really hard learning 720 shuvits and it's been very tender and tight ever since.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-07 00:02:37	@filmdevelop I wish the fact they are merely respooling IMAX movie stock was wider known; no recutting necessary.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-09 19:56:00	@lenire No, it didn't. I am so sick of that damn subject already.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-09 20:04:53	@lenire I wish everyone involved on both sides would just go boil their heads. Urgh.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-07 00:56:56	@ShellySometimes That's okay. John Allison just starts at a new point in the Scary Go Round universe every so often.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 14:01:19	@ujhphoto @lancekingphoto @drshitlord @rdhphotos I think that might be the only real answer.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 14:24:10	Does anyone want an OM1 MD + 50/1.8 on the cheap? Optically + mechanically perfect, some finder corrosion but useable? Say.... £35 + P&amp;P?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 14:28:35	Film scanning is boring. God, why do I bother? #darkroomFTW https://t.co/ACOhodbMLF
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 14:36:41	@ArneKuilman Meh. To me it's just another SLR and I don't understand the hype. I gave it a shot and it's not for me.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 14:40:16	@ArneKuilman Meh:
1) Why not show shutter speed in viewfinder?
2) Why keep the big shutter speed dial for ISO?
3) Still an SLR.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 14:42:17	@seecarlashoot Let me find a box, a shipping quote and my light seal replacement kit and it's yours.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 14:44:49	@samsnch Already claimed by @seecarlashoot. It's in chrome, anyway.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 15:25:40	I think this is a lovely photo of @TimeForTeaBlog1 but I'm sure she'll disagree (and hit me for Tweeting it). http://t.co/pJjx81gvI6
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 16:29:25	@jasonepowell Weight has never bothered me as much as size/bulk. A Leica IIIf is heavy but much easier to carry/pack than a bigger camera.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 16:48:48	@jasonepowell if @ShellySometimes is to be believed, size ALWAYS matters. #sizequeen
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 17:12:27	Oh, god. I wanted to speak to Dad and now I'm stuck with Mum. Please, stop. Let me hang up the phone. I'm trapped. NOOOOOO
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 17:14:14	This is the sort of situation that 2048 was coded for, I guess. Urgh.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 17:30:12	.@Beckwould I've just had to tolerate the "you're getting old, i want to see you with a nice wife, two kids and a house" rant. Urgh.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 17:39:00	@Beckwould Nope, that's just my mum. That's why I try to call the folks when I think only my Dad will be there.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-11 00:01:50	"@ShellySometimes told me to tell you to stop hitting me"..."ow!"

Guess I should have expected that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-09 15:15:52	@nmatospdx @lenire just got to run to the shop before it closes. If I'm 15 mins late don't worry. I'll be there - shop closes at 4 anyway!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-09 17:57:13	@Sekondosis I hope the box deserved it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-09 18:22:30	@Sekondosis Oh, I miss you, Matt.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 13:40:22	I wish stand developing didn't give me streaky negatives on a regular basis. The tones on this are really quite nice otherwise.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 13:45:11	@DrShitlord you can invert once after thirty minutes, but I've never tried it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 13:55:20	@lancekingphoto @DrShitlord @RDHphotos it's not contrast I'm struggling for - that seems mostly determined by temp. It's even development.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-10 13:57:02	@lancekingphoto @DrShitlord @RDHphotos 6ml Rodinal, 600ml water. Issue seems to be streaking around sprocket holes.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-11 11:37:29	@samsnch @nortypig  I like this, but it's more about setting one up than anything: http://t.co/EVBaqTZEoZ
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-11 14:07:56	Just had to complete a bunch of NHS paperwork. Fuckers provided an addressed envelope... But no stamp. Tight-fisted arseholes.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-13 18:29:41	Not only am I now out of both whisky and flapjack, but the pretty lady in my life is busy doing something interesting. Woe is me.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-12 23:05:47	My girlfriend just turned up after my skate session with flapjack. It's official: this one's a keeper.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-12 23:11:06	@samsnch you say heart, I say flapjack addiction.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-13 20:55:01	Just found these in my bag - dug them out when I went back to visit my parents. They're the photos… http://t.co/HR1637lwFb
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-12 23:52:33	@sunnivaj she's a very pretty lady who is far nicer than I deserve. Also, camera-shy.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-14 16:36:00	.@RustyExcavator That looks shopped. I can tell from some of the pixels &amp; from seeing quite a few shops in my time. http://t.co/vi9UO5x504
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-13 11:26:48	@sunnivaj proper job? We're not in Cornwall any more, lass.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-13 12:26:42	@mgagle @lenire Nope. Shanghai can be beautifully fully-toned. The issue is the curl of the film base combined with lots of "fog".
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-13 13:17:54	@samsnch Why are you so sure it's not the scanner?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-13 13:49:03	@JuloPeter Damn, that looks great. Wish my German skills were up to par; I'll have to see if there was an English printing.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-13 14:01:27	@JuloPeter I think I'll pass, but thanks for asking. Not being able to read the language would frustrate me!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-13 17:17:10	@JuloPeter I have that exact book. Great find!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-12 13:28:09	@ZDP189 52.4mm rings a bell for one of them. Give me a sec.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-12 13:31:28	@ZDP189 to be precise: 51.6mm for Leica, 52.3mm for Contax. Why'd you ask?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-12 14:57:40	So that's Final Fantasy VI ticked off. After V, VI, VII, Dissidia and Tactics, what's next? Crisis Core or VIII?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-12 16:07:20	@filmdevelop ...aaaaand of COURSE Terry Richardson is on there.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-14 00:28:48	Georgie made me whisky truffles today. Between this and the flapjack it's almost like she's trying to fatten me up. http://t.co/ZhlOcrEEOl

104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-14 13:30:07	You know, Flickr are cheeky bastards - I cancelled my pro account months ago and I just got an email they were about to take more money.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-17 23:24:28	@TomWelland I'd like to point you to http://t.co/WawKyO4frO for an explanation as to why I don't.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-17 23:24:56	@amanda_raney Thank you, lass. Means a lot to me - my Uncle Doug is getting reaaaaal old now, and he's my favourite relative.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-17 23:25:16	@JuloPeter I love Fomapan 400. Struggling to get the dev right for 100, but 400 is just perfect.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-17 23:33:03	@JuloPeter No. I dunk it in Ilford's LC29. It's cheaper and easier to get hold of.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-17 23:38:14	@JuloPeter Because M42 lenses have been increasingly bought up since digital photographers realised they could adapt them to their mounts.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-17 23:43:55	@JuloPeter Is this the Fomadon you were using? http://t.co/RYhTTJoGtX
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-18 00:00:13	@JuloPeter The later Leicas (IIIb onwards) are the ones to get - closer VF and RF windows, and the RF is 1.5x magnification. (Zorki/Fed=1:1)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-15 19:08:37	I love spinning. It feels very zen-like; I just wish I was better at it. #freestyleskateboarding https://t.co/oVKqqRZLgY

104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-17 16:54:27	@ShellySometimes Well, fuck.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-17 17:01:08	@lenire @shellysometimes I have teh film boner
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-17 17:03:08	@ShellySometimes @lenire Sad face. :(
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-17 17:34:33	@seecarlashoot Ovaries are no fun. You have my sympathy.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-17 19:50:10	Photographing my uncle with a lens that's even older than he is. #Leica IIIf, Summar, @Fomafoto's Fomapan 400. http://t.co/6DE5TnGQUg
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 17:56:31	@JuloPeter quite well. The separation means that the rangefinder is high magnification and precise and the viewfinder is clear and bright.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 18:00:08	Today's bookshop find is a beautiful #Leica book from 1937; essays on the system and great photos. http://t.co/K5PZY2RAKj
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 18:03:46	@JuloPeter hah, that looks great! I love old photographic arcana. The history is almost as fun as the images.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 18:10:36	@JuloPeter you did not. I bet that's a nice thing to have. Do you use it much?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 18:11:27	@JuloPeter you can get a good Leica IIIf with lens for much cheaper if you know where to look. But yes, it's worth seeing in person.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 18:13:57	This is possibly the only time I've ever seen anyone recommend those weird right-angled finders for the Leica. http://t.co/RKJcdlxkdF
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 18:18:28	@JuloPeter I know what you mean. I love MF but 35mm is far more convenient - and cheaper.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 18:19:24	@JuloPeter even now I'd argue it's case. The early screwmounts might be awkward to use at first but they make a phenomenal system.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 18:42:47	@JuloPeter Like what? It's fairly straightforward in my eyes, but then I've been doing it for years.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 19:29:05	@JuloPeter use the dedicated system cartridges for your camera if they exist. Buy reusable normal ones if not. old ones are a last resort.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 19:30:03	@viewfinder_m6 interesting considering LC29 is basically HC110. Wonder why that happened?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 19:48:33	@JuloPeter a Shirley Wellard (left) is the best option for an SLR - no felt, solid, unbreakable. http://t.co/i6aZ2QrtJg
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 19:49:07	@JuloPeter the middle ones are reusable and can be cleaned. The recycled factory cans are likely to scratch your film.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 21:09:04	@cloudyimages Looks more like bad metering to me.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 21:12:46	@cloudyimages In that sort of light I'd expect half-second exposures at f4 for 800ISO. Probably even longer.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 21:21:16	@The_Old_Penfold @viewfinder_m6 @cloudyimages Yeah. You have to start doubling exposure at around 1/2 a second with lots of 400ISO films.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-16 21:31:48	@viewfinder_m6 @cloudyimages @the_old_penfold Ilford recommend Microphen for high-speed pushing on HP5+. Check the datasheet.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-19 17:30:52	In this week's @Pdexposures we chat about legal matters and I get angry about watermarks &amp; exploitation: http://t.co/jHgMbNm8UL
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-19 18:22:05	@viewfinder_m6 @tomwelland Bet they mashed all the screwheads up and duct-taped the shutter back together.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-19 18:33:11	@ShellySometimes @lenire Here's something entertaining: http://t.co/BMvpOentTL
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-19 18:37:47	@lenire @shellysometimes This outdated version of Twitter for Mac does some WEIRD things.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-21 19:48:12	Ah, Dennis Skinner. I may love you a little bit... By which I mean a lot. http://t.co/q5zVBQSJ4U
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-21 19:54:00	Another basic #casper trick for this week's @showmeatrick #freestyletricktip. #freestyleskateboarding… http://t.co/4DmZI23XpI
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 11:29:27	@samsnch why a IIIc when you already have a IIf?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-22 00:11:13	@jasonepowell @filmdevelop @amanda_raney If I was female I would have battered him a long time ago. Creepy motherfucker.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-22 00:14:41	@filmdevelop @jasonepowell @amanda_raney Bring it, fat boy.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 14:02:43	I hate colour balancing. Fuck colour photography in the ass.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 14:03:29	@PeaSoukCafe The massive amount of distance I'd have to travel to get there? #sadface
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 17:23:13	@samsnch IIIcs are often prone to chrome degradation and pitting, though... and black ones are RARE.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 17:26:51	@samsnch (see http://t.co/ggdEhirRaK for how rare black paint IIIcs are... only about 300. Black II and IIIs are easier to get.)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 17:27:42	@ShellySometimes @filmferrania WE ALL LOVE SCENES FROM THE FACTORY
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 17:34:51	@filmdevelop oooh, bitchy. #catnoise
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 17:36:52	@filmferrania @shellysometimes Enough about me. What's happening at the factory?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 17:47:04	So.... you guys know my birthday is next month, right? Well... erm... nudge, nudge, etc.: http://t.co/9mMyLZSMWQ
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 18:09:39	@samsnch IIIa is also pretty rare in black.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 18:13:09	@samsnch No: https://t.co/i4Vw4PuI6V
The IIIa is almost entirely chrome. III is where chrome started to come in. Everything earlier = black.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 18:17:52	@samsnch I think the F may be the II. I never use that terminology. Very few people do.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 18:22:58	@samsnch But when you say Leica F people will think you mean a II/IIIf.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 11:25:03	@HamishGill what are you talking about?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 12:30:12	@samsnch But why the IIIc in particular?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-20 14:09:58	@PeaSoukCafe I'd love to but that shit is EXPENSIVE. Maybe next spring I'll pop down for a bit to say hi!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-19 16:03:09	Here's hoping this Angelina Jolie thing changes the default American impersonations of British people to something a little more Derbyshire.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-19 16:06:42	@Ben_Innocent It's the only valid part of England. Fuck the south east - it's full of middle class racists and wimps.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-19 16:11:02	@Ben_Innocent I'm being largely flippant. Kent (where I live now) is pretty but.... urgh. So middle-class.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-22 10:13:34	@ShellySometimes in all fairness, I spent last night playing Final Fantasy with my missus. You just need to find a fellow nerd!

104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-22 16:46:35	@ShellySometimes weirdest favourite ever? Possibly.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-23 16:57:37	@lenire correction: "Grammar lessons with @coldkennels." You missed the full stop - or period, if you prefer.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-23 16:59:41	@lenire I think you'll find that's spelt "interrobang".
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-23 19:35:29	WE GOT THE WRONG ONNNNNNNE
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-23 19:47:29	@cloudyimages why is that building upside down?

104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-22 18:23:12	Bloody hell. Leica R4 + 50mm Summicron for £258? Almost tempted to trade in all the SLR gear I own for that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-22 18:26:04	@jasonepowell I'd have a lot more space AND an SLR 50mm lens to die for.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-24 09:04:44	@The_Old_Penfold @ShellySometimes @seecarlashoot the funny thing is that I bloody hate 'em; that was just a really well made episode.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-23 14:43:25	@barneymccann That's truly fucking awful.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-22 20:37:44	@JuloPeter there's an R4 at my favourite dealer for £69...!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-22 20:40:50	@JuloPeter of course! My reasoning is that I don't like SLRs but on the occasion I "have" to use them, the results are underwhelming.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-22 20:41:17	@JuloPeter my Summicron and Summar both produce significantly more pleasing images than my SLR lenses.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-22 22:36:24	@adamsimonstweet Duct tape.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-22 22:37:51	@adamsimonstweet Duct tape has stronger adhesive. Use duct tape to hold it, electrical tape on top to light seal it.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-25 18:52:52	@bibliosk8er @TimeForTeaBlog1 my life has turned a corner, Bob. I've tricked a pretty girl into making me tasty whisky-filled treats.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-25 19:56:40	@bibliosk8er @TimeForTeaBlog1 what are you on about?! I always use extra exclamation marks!!!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-25 21:04:54	Fish out of water. #skateeverydamnday #skateboarding #freestylerproblems @ BaySixty6 http://t.co/VcR5T5AFLR
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-26 16:16:40	@eugenbaban @believeinfilm Their colour negative used to be Ferrania stock. They changed to cheap Kodak material about four years ago.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-26 16:52:15	@eugenbaban @believeinfilm Not a good one. Lomography only buy the cheapest stock possible.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-26 16:53:54	@eugenbaban @believeinfilm Probably whatever goes into their disposable cameras.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-26 17:31:46	@lenire @shellysometimes @mgagle Cold weather does affect Instax development. Put them into a coat pocket and keep them around body temp.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-26 00:42:03	@TimeForTeaBlog1 gah. And I'm stuck on a train, facing a long hike and I STILL won't be able to have some. 😭
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-26 18:07:54	I have a new hat. It's slightly daft but I love it. http://t.co/oH2mmBl36W
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-26 18:11:15	@FilmShooter66 I used to have a green one years ago. I'm hoping I can convince @jimmyzworld84 to make a series of these.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-26 01:18:10	If I can skate 21 miles in the rain for charity, I guess I can walk 4.5 in the rain to get home.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-26 02:44:46	So that took a while. #sorefeet
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-26 20:47:46	@ShellySometimes @mgagle @lenire OMG THAT'S TOUCHED SHELLY'S BOOBS
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-27 23:56:24	#Regram from @jimmyzworld84; the web store is finally live, just in time for #Blackfriday. If you use… http://t.co/zmY1muPxc2
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-28 00:16:22	@lenire @jimmyzworld84 We're starting to now. Everything American bleeds over here eventually.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-27 01:12:58	And for bad apps, apparently. http://t.co/2FDKBuQl1f
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-28 11:48:48	@jonasx70 yeah, the Maizenburg book is a must-have for most Soviet collectors.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-27 12:50:11	One benefit of working from home: I get to sit in my bucket hat and listen to my 90's themed Spotify playlist. http://t.co/CQvV1cdWR7
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-27 12:57:13	@sunnivaj It depends a lot on your perspective... And whether you're listening to the Happy Mondays while you're looking at it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-27 15:10:08	@CrockerSean Wallet chain, eh? Now there's an idea...
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-28 18:55:46	My clothing sponsor @jimmyzworld84 has a #blackfriday sale &amp; clothes are far cooler than TVs: http://t.co/IqEJ07O0ve http://t.co/WMz3UQYrWd
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-28 18:56:35	Maybe that should have said "20% off". OH WELL
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-29 18:37:57	@duggbug @samsnch No, a Uke is a world unto its own, because of the reentrant tuning; GCEA is similar to guitar, but the G is an octave up.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-29 18:39:09	@duggbug @samsnch Incidentally, a banjo is almost the same as the top four strings of a guitar (DGBD, not DGBE), but with an extra hi G.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-29 18:45:03	@duggbug @samsnch Banjo is the worst. Tunings I use: gCGCD, gDGCD, gDGBD, gDGBbD, f#DF#AD, f#ADAD. All over the shop.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-27 15:49:23	Things that miraculously fix themselves make me nervous.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-27 16:40:26	@hglover683 I may have just said that out loud and giggled to myself. Heh.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-27 16:57:18	@DrShitlord @hglover683 South Park, you asshat.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-27 17:03:34	Let's just keep throwing stuff at it and see what sticks.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-30 00:30:32	@amanda_raney I know the answer... it's a shitty camera made to low standards. NEXT.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-30 00:38:57	@amanda_raney Don't bother. Those things are so badly made they often don't work straight out of the box.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-30 18:17:36	@jasonepowell @amanda_raney a million times better in every way.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-30 21:39:45	A Eulogy - This man died today. He was by no means a great man. History won’t remember his name. But he was... http://t.co/1zPnlJCRvr
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-30 21:48:51	Just so someone else will know, will remember. http://t.co/tzwBf5X4SX http://t.co/g68Cpafqnu
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-30 23:04:32	@FilmShooter66 @amanda_raney thanks. He was fantastic; kind, honest, funny. So many good stories despite the hardship.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-29 11:58:13	@samsnch Ukes are a poor man's mandolin. Aim higher, Sam.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-29 12:26:59	@samsnch Doesn't change the fact that Ukes are bloody awful.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-29 12:28:28	@samsnch ALWAYS.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-29 12:29:06	@samsnch If only because then you could learn this and be awesome. https://t.co/zpv7pwwTMe
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-29 12:35:15	@samsnch also, mandolin tuning is widely used, so you won't always be stuck with a high pitched instrument: http://t.co/Rn9YBKmcnK
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-29 12:39:30	Name that tune. #bouzouki #what https://t.co/sadpbgfv2A
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-29 12:41:46	@samsnch http://t.co/m1hVCHdNT3 because it's a big mandolin and that is awesome.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-11-29 14:30:55	Glad I've got another one of these on the way... This one's looking a bit worse for wear.… http://t.co/uaXrsjsTzs
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-01 01:42:57	Thanks for the condolences, everyone. Means a lot.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-01 01:44:21	In other news, Georgie has fallen asleep tonight to me drunkenly singing Du Hast to her. Not sure how that's possible.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-01 18:10:33	@TimeForTeaBlog1 @LaRocheTW looks good to me... Very good, in fact!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-01 18:11:24	@jonasx70 @pdexposures for if there is one thing I'm known for, it's.... Sodomy?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 13:56:44	@ZDP189 I'm assuming they're Amedeo adapters, yes? Contax to M?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 13:57:59	.@filmdevelop @seecarlashoot @lomography "let's take that thing we really love and butcher it so that it's not even remotely useable! YAY!"
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 14:13:42	@ZDP189 Nice. Fully functioning and focusing?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 20:27:58	@ShellySometimes @lenire @nmatospdx Still not as bad as the podcast in question.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 20:28:32	@shellysometimes @lenire @nmatospdx And we all know who I mean but I dare not speak their name. They might pull a Betelgeuse.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 20:38:50	@Uncl3Rick Never used one. Very tempted, but the general rule of Zeiss cameras is "over-engineered, over-complicated, hard to get repaired".
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 20:40:02	@Uncl3Rick Sounds about right. Of course, the optics are almost certainly fantastic, but Zeiss' engineers were a very eccentric bunch.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 20:40:34	@Uncl3Rick Here's a fun game: buy a cheap Kiev rangefinder (identical to the Zeiss Contax RF) and strip it down. MEIN GOTT IM HIMMEL.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 20:42:12	@Uncl3Rick Rolleiflexes are beautifully built but I wouldn't pay $$$ for one. A Yashica is a better camera to actually use.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 20:45:04	@Uncl3Rick If you do buy one, be prepared to replace the viewfinder screen; Rollei viewfinders are surprisingly/painfully dim.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 21:09:49	An important sentiment for a Tuesday evening: Tonberries are annoying assholes.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 21:22:42	@ChrisFecio If there's an Argus C3 going REALLY cheap i'd like it for teh lolz.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 21:23:16	@ChrisFecio Yeah, pretty much.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 21:38:33	@jasonepowell @chrisfecio Well, any bargain price is good. They're £30+ here. I just want one to 
a) put on a shelf
b) hit with hammers
c)??
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 21:40:36	@jasonepowell @chrisfecio Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe I want to do this for @pdexposures. Who knows?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 21:41:05	@jasonepowell @shellysometimes Well, @chrisfecio is the best ANYTHING in Buffalo as far as I'm concerned.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 21:44:59	@jasonepowell @chrisfecio Don't do it and let me do it in a @pdexposures video for posterity and amusement.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 21:46:22	@jasonepowell @chrisfecio This is because, despite what Americans think, the Argus wasn't that revolutionary or common outside the USA.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 21:46:41	@jasonepowell @chrisfecio But because of Americans rambling on about how revolutionary they were, idiots over here try selling them for £££.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 21:55:17	@ChrisFecio Zorki. No Leica had chrome screws on the body.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 21:55:41	@NMatosPDX @chrisfecio No, not necessarily. Could be a Zorki, Fed, or many other clones (but probably a Zorki).
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 21:57:03	@ChrisFecio @nmatospdx Yes and no. The lenses mount but are made to a different standard calibration: http://t.co/HDz989C1gB
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 21:59:46	@ChrisFecio Because of love, right?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 22:01:26	Look at this bullshit, @jasonepowell. Far too much money for a shitty camera. http://t.co/PmPPy5CEN6
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 22:02:35	@ChrisFecio For me? Naaaaaah. The TLRs are nice but I haz no monies.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 22:02:56	@jasonepowell @chrisfecio I've had rabid Americans literally trying to convince me that 35mm film wouldn't still exist without the C3.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 22:05:26	@jasonepowell @chrisfecio Massive stretch considering Contax and Leica. Also, 35mm cassettes are as they are because the Leica existed.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 22:08:27	@jasonepowell It literally only had any effect on the US market. No one outside the US gave a shit.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 22:09:58	@jasonepowell Not that much. Ilford, Agfa and Fuji have always been bigger.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 22:13:51	@jasonepowell I don't think enough people listen to my perfectly-valid angry rants to make a noticeable difference to our income.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 22:14:19	@jasonepowell I don't think Ilford ever manufactured Rapid cassettes. May be wrong. We weren't as proprietary in the EU as Kodak were.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 22:14:50	@jasonepowell Seriously, the amount of format fuckery Kodak went into is above and beyond ANYTHING that happened this side of the pond.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 22:21:37	@jasonepowell Rapid film was actually a good idea. All these numbered ones from Kodak aren't, however. http://t.co/ZI8kZOQmWc
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 22:29:07	@jasonepowell No, not idiocy. It was their attempt to make a proprietary system so they could make more money. See also: 126, Disc, APS.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 00:52:14	@filmdevelop That name needs a hyphen. Unless, of course, it's run by chickens.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 18:56:13	Looks like Buzzfeed have bore witness to a day in the life of @Sekondosis. http://t.co/5Ywk6qJza1
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 19:04:44	@ellacumber So you enjoyed China then?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 19:05:49	@lenire No, we discussed that. Very 80s.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 19:20:01	@Uncl3Rick @pdexposures I always forget about them. No idea why.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 20:21:39	@lenire @nmatospdx Dear god. That is the worst thing I've ever heard... and I've sat and listened to some atrocious podcasts.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-02 20:26:46	@ShellySometimes @lenire @nmatospdx I was trying to think of something that was even worse to listen to and a certain podcast was all I had.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 17:01:30	@yeknom ....I like lenses.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 17:37:20	@jasonepowell @yeknom Not as iconic as the early ones, though. See also the fixed lens Leica I. That's a pricey desire, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 17:38:34	@jasonepowell @yeknom The Standard (interchangeable lenses) is a nice setup, actually. Get a 35mm Summaron on there and it's GREAT.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 17:47:08	@The_Old_Penfold @jasonepowell @yeknom Mostly water. Occasionally custard.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 17:48:47	@The_Old_Penfold @jasonepowell @yeknom Brings a whole new meaning to Yellow Submarine.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 17:50:42	@lenire @jasonepowell @yeknom I wish it had literally been aborted. Didn't they have enough coat hangers at Lomography HQ that day?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 15:16:35	This week's @pdexposures podcast - featuring @MattDayPhoto - is now live! Go listen at http://t.co/p5uSnoQkaH
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 17:07:40	@yeknom Do I get a badge?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 17:27:33	@jasonepowell @yeknom Very old Leica? 50mm? Summar. You can find a good one for less than £100 if you hunt properly.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 17:28:12	@jasonepowell @the_old_penfold @yeknom Meanwhile... fuck pinholes.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 17:28:43	@jasonepowell @yeknom I have one of the earliest Summicrons (screw mount). Bloody lovely lens.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 17:30:55	@jasonepowell @yeknom All the screwmount 50mm f2 lenses have their own look. I could recommend any of them.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 17:32:45	@jasonepowell @yeknom I think you should go for the pre war Contax RF 50mm f1.5 on an Amedeo adapter, Dan.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 17:34:25	@jasonepowell @yeknom I think a black Leica II + nickel Elmar 3.5 is just as iconic (and beautiful). Add it to the list.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 17:38:00	@jasonepowell @yeknom (to clarify: a IIIf really deserves a Summitar, Summicron or Elmar 2.8 - keep it period-correct.)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 17:49:00	@lenire @jasonepowell @yeknom Needs more swearing.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 18:28:34	@TimeForTeaBlog1 @nmatospdx No, I've been telling you. We need to watch Alien first.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-04 00:04:05	@yeknom wait, what?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-03 23:31:34	@mr_mikefraser @jasonepowell @yeknom Great lens! It was a touch-and-go decision for me between that and the Summicron.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-04 00:51:32	@yeknom I had to make sure I completely removed it.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-05 14:10:13	@ellacumber tha's a bit beautiful, that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-05 15:46:00	@SandyPhimester @ILFORDPhoto Wow. That's stunning, Sandy.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-05 15:52:47	@ChrisFecio Welcome to the future, Chris. It's beautiful.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-05 15:56:13	@ChrisFecio I guess it would if you were on an iPhone 4 or similar. This thing's really designed for the bigger phones.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-05 16:03:07	@jasonepowell @chrisfecio PROTIP: Download Paper and delete the Facebook app. It's a much better UI for using Facebook.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-05 16:04:38	@jasonepowell @chrisfecio Yes, it does! AND it uses less space on your phone. Win/win/win.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-07 22:24:41	@lenire That's not that bad, actually. A bit unnecessary, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-07 22:25:35	@viewfinder_m6 @hamishgill Your collapsible 'cron must be slightly out of whack, then.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-08 00:16:39	@viewfinder_m6 @hamishgill I don't think people can make sweeping statements considering the age of the lenses in question. See: Summar.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-08 02:26:47	@13Stoploss Any Computrol/Watson/Prinz style loader. Basically, if it looks like this, it's a good choice: http://t.co/cR1gQqmjcv
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-07 12:55:17	@WryToastPhotos That's basically it, yes. Do the right thing - buy a rangefinder today.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-07 18:07:33	@MarisaWriting @optikozine @filmdevelop It's never too early to be pedantic... By which I mean correct, of course.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-07 18:33:33	@MarisaWriting @optikozine @filmdevelop Well, that too.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-08 19:34:30	@BPMonkey congratulations, Ivan. You're now officially old. #BahHumbug
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-08 20:22:41	@cloudyimages I cancelled mine, too. I'm not giving @flickr any more of my bloody money.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-06 19:05:13	@ajleaps Ooooh. Slightly envious.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-09 13:54:54	@BPMonkey That's beautiful. A truly modern-day romance.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-09 14:09:00	Work, work, work. Which actually means skating across the office with coffee and tinkering with photoshop for hours. Not too bad, really.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-09 09:17:41	Feeling proper wintery this morning. Brr. http://t.co/pWXy04xjH1

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-11 11:49:31	@samsnch @lenire @drshitlord Which was that? What were we going to talk about? Long time since we've done something gear-centric.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-11 12:42:18	@samsnch I can't think what we've not already covered.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-11 12:43:44	@samsnch Better do my research, then. Japanese copies were plentiful.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:12:45	FOOD EXPERIMENT! I just learned Lucky Charms are wheat-free. I've never had 'em but @TimeForTeaBlog1 swears by them. http://t.co/4oA6RJIzRb
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:13:36	First thoughts: they smell horrible and look thoroughly American (by which I mean processed and synthetic). My body will hate these.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:14:18	Rapidly learning this is true: “@lenire: @coldkennels @TimeForTeaBlog1 the marshmellows are the only edible bits”
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:15:27	Also, I'm slightly surprised they're supposed to be marshmallows. I assumed they were refined from oil, they were so brightly coloured.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:16:28	Giggity: “@ShellySometimes: Lucky Charms are disgusting. I hate 'em and this is coming from someone who'll put about anything in her mouth.”
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:17:31	Okay. The beige bits were horrid and bland at first. Now they've rapidly become soggy and bland, too. There's no substance left.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:18:38	Oh, God. I've finished the bowl and the leftover milk has gone slightly green. That's just not right. http://t.co/rSlZQ8qhFj
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:18:54	HOLY HELL EVEN THE MILK TASTED BAD ARGHHHH
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:20:09	So that was both underwhelming and disgusting. Join me next week for another instalment of "Tony eats processed American crap".
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:20:54	@The_Old_Penfold @ShellySometimes @lenire @amazon oh holy mother of god, no.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:21:51	@TimeForTeaBlog1 @lenire I thought it'd be a prime opportunity for some fascinating micro-blogging. I'm on the cutting edge of the twitters.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:23:24	this, but with added brightly-coloured synthetic bits: “@JeremyKruger: @coldkennels it's all cardboard and sawdust”
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:24:21	@lenire @TimeForTeaBlog1 exactly. I'm so far behind the curve that I'm actually innovating. It's RADICAL.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:24:56	It gets worse. That stuff made me burp and it tasted even more horrendous the second time.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:25:19	@JeremyKruger I guessed as much. Blergh.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:25:40	@ShellySometimes apparently, you'd know.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:26:07	Brb, going to wash my mouth out with bleach and pretend like this never happened.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:27:22	.@lancekingphoto never even heard of those. A large amount of american products can't be sold here; considered unfit for human consumption.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:30:49	@lenire ....wait, what?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:31:33	@JeremyKruger @lenire I have no idea - @TimeForTeaBlog1 bought them. If they are, I now feel really guilty. Also, shocked.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:32:40	@ShellySometimes @lenire they look just like Sugar Puffs. Probably with 90 million more artificial flavourings, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-10 21:39:47	"no tropical oils". What about petrol-based ones? “@ShellySometimes: Here's another for you to try: http://t.co/iv84boQtHY”
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-11 16:03:10	@DrShitlord @samsnch @lenire a massive amount of TLAs FTW. LOL!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-11 00:19:48	@patrickjclarke It's bullshit. Medium format inconvenience without the uniqueness of 6x6 or the resolution of 6x7 or 6x9.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-11 00:26:58	@patrickjclarke @pdexposures I missed this story. How the HELL does a 25 year old become a CEO? How is that even remotely feasible?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-11 00:29:09	@patrickjclarke @yeknom and waste all that lovely square format goodness? Why bother?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-11 00:31:09	@patrickjclarke @pdexposures I turn 27 on Friday &amp; there's no way I should be making executive decisions. I can't even choose socks.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-12 00:27:56	Starting my 27th birthday by listening to Dance On Your Grave Mrs Thatcher. Can't imagine a better way to begin the year.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-12 00:32:49	@ShellySometimes I don't really believe it's Friday here yet. It won't be my birthday until I sleep but hey. BIRTHDAY!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-12 00:33:50	@seecarlashoot never mind success, I just want it to be full of violence and beauty.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-12 00:33:59	@ShellySometimes that is correct!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-12 16:38:13	@ShellySometimes @lenire it's a fair comment.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-12 16:38:54	@patrickjclarke hah, happy birthday Jonathan! Frank Sinatra was born on this day too.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-12 18:14:06	@AlexxxxCorona Thanks! It should really be Soviet or a Leica, though. :P
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-12 13:04:58	@The_Old_Penfold @ujhphoto @shellysometimes thanking someone is not a counter-revolutionary act, comrade.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-16 02:00:32	@ChrisFecio well so far, being 27 feels to me much like being 26, only more worried about being poor. That said, I'm only 3 days in.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-16 02:31:48	GUYS I AM TRYING TO SLEEP CAN YOU ALL SHUT UP ALREADY
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-16 22:49:35	@chrisalban1 strange. The girl next to me on the train is falling asleep. Must be something in the air.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-14 19:04:18	@DrShitlord yeah, it's supposed to change to $ when american IPs access it. Obviously it ain't working.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-15 13:27:26	@ZDP189 Ideology overruling the financial department? Dangerous, that.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-17 11:36:19	@eugenbaban Yeah, I'm sure it's great. Just... time. I never seem to have much of it nowadays.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-17 16:05:11	Can anyone in America check this URL for me, please? It's supposed to show $ and not £ for you guys: http://t.co/jGdWEnvLWP
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-17 16:06:23	Thank you, Twitter hivemind! Obviously the proxy was the problem, not the site. Phew.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-20 00:21:24	@lenire Sounds like the sort of thing @TimeForTeaBlog1 would do. She's weird like that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-19 11:48:06	@chrisalban1 BUT IT'S HILARIOUS! THE FUNNIEST THING EVER!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-19 17:45:06	@chrisalban1 this is how I feel about every viral video.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-19 17:26:21	@ujhphoto @TomWelland just get the materials and do it yourself. It's easy enough to do.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-21 00:30:32	Of all the instruments I left behind, I didn't think this would be the first I reached for when I came back to visit. http://t.co/mdq4ruaujx

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-21 01:47:16	@jasonepowell you and me both. I'd love a working one; one particular viewfinder part and the shutter are both prone to failure.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-21 23:05:49	My good mate davepnd just dropped by to give me this as a late birthday present. Best present ever -… http://t.co/T0eEI963nE

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-20 21:48:27	@DrShitlord @Peapodcaucaux what's the latest? Peapod ready to kill you yet?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-21 02:54:02	@jasonepowell yeah, they're crazy expensive. One of the few Soviet products intended for the elite, so no expense spared.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-22 19:11:28	@NMatosPDX bargain. You should buy it. Lovely little lens, that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-22 19:12:29	@DrShitlord @Peapodcaucaux now that's lovely.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-22 19:15:22	@jasonepowell if @NMatosPDX isn't going to buy it to use on an M (which he should) he should pick it up for you.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-22 08:44:53	@DrShitlord @Peapodcaucaux congrats - and that's a beautiful name!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-21 11:51:35	@TimeForTeaBlog1 a dulcimer. Weird little thing. Can't play much on it but it's very interesting.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-22 22:58:07	@yeknom @pdexposures I approve. I think @NMatosPDX would get behind it, too.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-21 15:20:09	Genuine conversation I just had w' me dad:
"Y'alreet, dad?"
"Ahh. Y'alreet?"
"Ahh."
*nods and walks away*
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-21 15:20:49	@DulcimerBand @TimeForTeaBlog1 I normally play banjo and I still think that thing's weird. 😉
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-21 16:19:48	@DulcimerBand @TimeForTeaBlog1 what's the difference between a banjo and a trampoline? You take your boots off to jump on the trampoline.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-23 13:36:54	Happy birthday to my favourite Texan, @ajleaps! Much transatlantic love n' that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-23 14:06:31	@amanda_raney wanna know how silent I was when religious nuts started singing Jerusalem at my uncle's funeral? 

Very.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-23 14:14:21	@yeknom @amanda_raney exactly that... Such bullshit.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-21 17:39:43	@TimeForTeaBlog1 @TWComicCafe aye, I wouldn't mind that if it's still going. Can't pick it up for a week or so, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-21 17:39:57	@TimeForTeaBlog1 YOU HUSSY
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-21 17:43:21	@TimeForTeaBlog1 well, fine. I'm going to spend the next hour looking at Lara Croft's bum, then.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-23 16:27:21	Morrisons and I apparently have very different feelings about coleslaw. http://t.co/Dq3F8gqxId
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-23 16:37:34	@adamsimonstweet it's bloody awful, isn't it? I'd love to know who came up with it so I could stab them in the face with a fork.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-23 17:06:08	@TimeForTeaBlog1 wow. Are you really that bored without me?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-23 17:10:11	@TimeForTeaBlog1 more than me?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-23 17:13:09	@TimeForTeaBlog1 what? peanut M&amp;Ms are blatantly better than @LuckyCharms (sorry guys)!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-23 23:28:10	Staying with my parents means I'm exposed to television adverts for the first time in a year. God, these things are awful.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-23 23:59:57	.@TimeForTeaBlog1 I just saw the one about a Tesco shop wearing a Christmas hat and it gave me an irrational urge to stab people.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-24 00:13:20	@TimeForTeaBlog1 hi, my name is Tony. Have we met?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-24 13:04:39	@HamishGill swap the dark ginger for some proper ginger wine and you'll be laughing. A good whisky Mac is a great thing.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-24 18:04:48	Bloody well bruised the arch of my back foot skating today and I'm going skating again later. Grr. #freestylerproblems
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-24 18:11:15	@bibliosk8er good shout homeslice
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 10:50:03	@lenire @TimeForTeaBlog1 @samsnch @DrShitlord I prefer #shitpea. I think that's got a real ring to it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 10:52:33	@TimeForTeaBlog1 now we're talking! Omnomnom.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 10:55:27	That RT is why @Sekondosis and I are still kindred spirits, even though we've not seen each other for over a year.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 10:55:56	@Sekondosis (also, merry Christmas you grumpy git)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 11:07:28	Fröhe weinachten, people. Hope the imaginary fat man doesn't have to be blamed for bringing you boring ol' socks this year.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 11:33:44	BORED NOW
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 11:44:41	Trying to wake my dad up with loud, spirited renditions of the Fairytale of New York on a tenor banjo. Not sure it's working... PLAY LOUDER!

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 00:28:39	@jasonepowell is this a shiny present?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 00:29:29	@ellacumber *massive virtual hugs*
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 00:56:29	@jasonepowell any of the Leica 50s would do. What's the priority? Speed, size, sharpness, portraiture?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 01:05:27	@CrockerSean nah, heading back South as soon as I can. By which I mean Sunday. FUCK THIS PLACE
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 01:08:02	@TimeForTeaBlog1 I like the fact they didn't spot the time I shouted cunt and censor me this time.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 01:10:50	@CrockerSean YES! Let's go skate Kennington Bowl together in the new year.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 01:12:43	@lenire @pdexposures did you see what I had as presents today? ALLLLL THE WHISKY http://t.co/DnGi4i9Uxo
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 01:15:46	@CrockerSean aye, it'd work. Aim for shallow kicktails, wheels that cover the axle nuts and something thinner than 8".
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 01:17:37	@TimeForTeaBlog1 it's not on your page - it's on mine! Lrn2twitter, lass.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 01:28:26	@CrockerSean let me see if I can find you a complete that'll do the job.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 01:29:01	@TimeForTeaBlog1 rude? I'm never rude.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 01:34:40	@CrockerSean here you go - good size, complete, freestyle-ready, no import tax, and the euro's cheaper than pounds: http://t.co/86UmFLPrY5
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 01:55:15	@CrockerSean you don't have to have the skid plates. I'm sure Christian (who runs that shop) could leave them off for you.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 02:20:56	@CrockerSean buy it as a late Xmas present to yourself, mate.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 02:21:40	@jasonepowell if you don't mind an f3.5 maximum aperture, a late coated Elmar is a wonderful thing. I'm still tempted by one myself.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 12:35:19	@jasonepowell Early ones are uncoated and have pre-war apertures - f4.5, f6.3, etc. Later ones are coated and have the familiar apertures.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 14:52:13	@ShellySometimes the country thanks you, Shelly.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 17:13:36	@yeknom it's a bloody great book, isn't it?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 17:13:44	@yeknom also, WHAT BOARD GAMES?????
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-26 20:32:40	@yeknom Dominion! I want that game. Played it years ago and it's bloody amazing.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-27 01:08:26	Spent today with this beautiful pair. Going to miss them when I head home in a couple of days. http://t.co/KHkXC59csb

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-27 01:33:23	@lenire I got angry.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-27 17:16:41	Those Bay sessions with @jimmyz1984 are paying off. He'd love this bowl! http://t.co/la7KM5HiOh

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-28 14:42:24	Shin pads... Yeah, they help, but it almost feels like cheating. #freestylerproblems #skateboarding https://t.co/1hVbdsbbVO
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-28 15:06:45	This is the Derbyshire that I miss; the hills, the dales, the fields. The snow is just a bonus. http://t.co/WCKq8l9LtO
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-28 17:01:51	@shootfilmride yeah - typical story. Mine doesn't work either.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-28 17:58:26	@shootfilmride @barneymccann yeah. Film transport is fiddly at best and the shutter stops capping if the lubricants dry out.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-28 00:50:38	@cloudyimages are you mad, suicidal or trolling? I can't tell.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-28 02:46:22	@cloudyimages then why would you do that to yourself???
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-24 22:34:19	My mum watching Rush Hour 2: "are those guys just friends or are they supposed to be brothers?" 

Wait, what?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-24 22:52:14	Another classic from my mum: "is that Bruce Lee?" (She was referring to Jackie Chan.)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-24 22:53:12	@DrShitlord man, I remember when you were cool and talked about cameras and stuff. #bringbackJBPhoto
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 00:07:46	@DrShitlord see, that's better.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 00:08:13	@DrShitlord tweeting about your sexcrement all day long. It's disgusting.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 00:09:11	I like chestnuts. They're like little nutty brains. Omnomnom.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 02:02:27	"Who were you talking to on the phone earlier?"
"Georgie."
"Is she missing you?"
"Yeah."
"....stupid girl."

Gee, thanks Dad.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 02:02:53	@TimeForTeaBlog1 mislabeled animals in cups? HOW DID YOU KNOW???
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 02:08:14	I wish @TimeForTeaBlog1 had a regular non-tea-themed Twitter account so it didn't look like I was dating an obsessive when I mention her.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 02:09:39	But then my Twitter name appears to be a public service announcement about the plight of neglected dogs at winter, so what do I know.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 02:18:55	@TimeForTeaBlog1 very much so, but I'd have to label it "kitten" or my OCD would explode.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 02:23:23	@lenire @TimeForTeaBlog1 harass away, mein freund. Just know that my retaliation will be brutal.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 02:25:21	@lenire @ajleaps I am sure @TimeForTeaBlog1 will appreciate the extra traffic. It might also help you on any future visits to Kent.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 02:30:32	@TimeForTeaBlog1 @lenire Having Simon harass you is like dealing with a 10 year old... He's Texan, and therefore easy to outwit and confuse.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 02:30:57	@lenire @ajleaps @TimeForTeaBlog1 it's bloody good. Lots of countryside. Some ruined abbeys and the like, too.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 02:56:59	@IsaacLagarda it's the title of a song I wrote in an old band with my best friend. I'm still pretty proud of that one.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 02:59:29	@TimeForTeaBlog1 @lenire see also: missus, partner, 'er indoors, me better 'alf, ball n' chain, only girl who'd tolerate my bullshit.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 03:00:11	@TimeForTeaBlog1 oh, Georgie. Don't worry, you'll get to know @lenire eventually.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 03:03:32	@IsaacLagarda Irish people travelling to America for a better life only to be worked like dogs.

We only ever wrote nice, cheerful ditties.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 03:09:13	@TimeForTeaBlog1 @lenire but all the rest are fine? duly noted.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 03:11:26	@TimeForTeaBlog1 ssh, don't get too sappy on Twitter, lass. I have a reputation to uphold here. I've spent years crafting this facade!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 03:12:15	@TimeForTeaBlog1 @lenire I think that's an exclusively working class old-fashioned reference, that.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-25 03:14:25	@TimeForTeaBlog1 @lenire that's exactly how my dad uses the phrase.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-29 17:48:10	@amanda_raney @samsnch It is bloody good. I'm going to watch Allegiance as well, however - if only because @gavinstenhouse is in it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-29 17:52:53	@HamishGill Fun fact: The later Leica screwmounts have an EBL of 58.5mm, making them even more accurate than the M7, never mind the Bessa.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-29 17:56:53	@samsnch @hamishgill Everything after the RF became 1.5x instead of 1:1. a 1:1 screwmount has a 39mm EBL - still better than a Bessa R2!
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-29 18:01:07	@samsnch @HamishGill I thought early Leicas had a 1:1 rangefinder window. Maybe I'm thinking of the Zorki 1.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-29 18:18:19	@HamishGill Very true. One thing you neglected to mention is that physical RF distance is more important than RF magnification.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-29 18:18:45	@HamishGill A higher EBL based on RF mag is more prone to mechanical errors, but less prone to user error.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-29 18:22:18	@HamishGill If I write one at all, it'll go on Pdexposures. ;)
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-29 18:23:55	@HamishGill Oh, one more thing... do you have an ORAKO for your IIIa?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-29 18:29:15	@HamishGill They make a big, big difference. My IIIf with the OKARO is the most precise manual focusing setup I've ever used. EVER.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-29 20:14:12	@jasonepowell @the_old_penfold @frau_inga Actually, Alex is right. Dr Who is poorly written schlock with little exception.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-29 20:15:28	.@Sekondosis I hear Weston-super-Mare is where Theme Hospital's unbeatable secret 13th level was set, it's that disease-ridden.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-29 20:42:51	@yeknom @the_old_penfold @jasonepowell @frau_inga This basically sums it up. The idea's fantastic. The execution ranges from poor to dire.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-29 21:04:49	@cloudyimages @the_old_penfold @jasonepowell @frau_inga Mass market appeal does not equate quality, my friend.

See also: One Direction.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-29 21:35:40	.@jasonepowell The fact you think Song 2 is in any way indicative of UK pop means you have no right to engage in a music conversation.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-29 21:50:00	@cloudyimages @jasonepowell It was. But it's nothing like anything else Blur did or in any way a sample of the average UK pop song.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-30 16:51:12	@ujhphoto Canon 7 is considerably better for someone with glasses. You can actually see all the framelines.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-30 17:14:02	@ujhphoto Yeah, I'm not a fan of Bessas at all. The Canon 7's not bad - providing you get a tripod mount strap lug for it.
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-30 17:25:05	@ujhphoto @shootfilmride Mine doesn't. Dodgy wiring, I think; could be fixable but I don't dare try to strip it down.

104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-31 15:53:12	@samsnch Then shouldn't that tweet have read "10 minuten VOR #Neujahr"? Nach = after, right?
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-31 15:56:35	@samsnch That's not a typo, that's a Gehirnfurz. :P
104572011	coldkennels	2014-12-31 16:44:42	@lenire @pdexposures it was a toss-up between that and the traditional angry punk music.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-01 00:20:29	@Sekondosis I think I am now all out of fucks to give.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-01 14:17:19	The reports of my emotional demise have been greatly exaggerated.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-02 17:44:53	The writing in this press statement about having the Union Jack on new driving license is worryingly jingoistic: https://t.co/GohFczewiG

104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-02 17:56:24	@lenire Yep, that's pretty hideous, but still better than the new UK one.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-01 21:45:58	@jasonepowell That's quite a good idea. The original ones are STUPIDLY over-priced now.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-05 19:22:16	@TimeForTeaBlog1 look who I just found! http://t.co/tXyKrgFLko
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-05 19:40:41	@HamishGill I knew that and I don't even own an M. Tsk, rookie.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-05 19:46:02	@HamishGill Now you just need one of these: http://t.co/mUlAVIB1sa

104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-05 19:51:20	@HamishGill @viewfinder_m6 sure. Which one? http://t.co/CVRGapRaL9
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-05 20:54:41	@ArneKuilman I've never seen or used the L-39. The reason I use Westons is that they're solid metal, need no batteries, and small.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-05 20:55:47	@barneymccann @themichaelowen I feel more inspired already. I was going to quit working on this site, but I guess I better stay in the game.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-05 20:59:08	@ArneKuilman Reliable, easy to read and informative. The front dial contains zone system information, too.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-04 12:40:52	@gavinstenhouse @NBCAllegiance @nbc oooh. Is Amazon prime going to get it in the UK a la @NBCConstantine? That'd be nice.

Nuno is a crazy man.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-06 18:14:58	@yeknom Considering the Leica was conceptualised as a portable camera for landscapes, I'd say not.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-06 18:17:59	@yeknom For what it's worth, I use mine for portraits mostly these days. It's a very versatile system.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-06 18:19:37	@yeknom Summar 50/2 for slightly soft, flattering portraits, Summicron 50/2 for standard everyday use, Elmar 90/4 for the BEST portraits.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-06 18:26:35	@yeknom You have an M2, yes? You could always use an external finder. The collapsible SEROO is 1:1 and GORGEOUS.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-06 18:27:00	@yeknom (also, the collapsible 90mm Elmar is one of the few things I would consider the M system for.)
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-06 18:28:14	@yeknom Because it's optically the same as my beloved LTM one but collapses to the size of a 50mm when not in use. Fantastic lens.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-06 18:28:54	@yeknom If you want good 50mm and 90mm frames... you should get an M3.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-06 18:29:59	@yeknom Then maybe a viewfinder magnifier is what you need.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-06 22:31:47	@patrickjclarke It's bullshit. It's all bullshit. BULLSHIT
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-06 22:58:57	@patrickjclarke I'm not a fan, but I'd rather have that than Lomography's tat.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-05 18:42:06	@juliarevitt Beautiful light meters. I think I have four of them now; never use anything else.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-08 12:09:58	I swear the GoDaddy support guys move your site to a better server while you're on the phone with them just to fuck with you.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-08 20:04:23	@rhiannon_louise you got a life?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-08 21:24:20	@rhiannon_louise Las Vegas, Amsterdam, Bristol and London. Mostly London.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-08 21:29:20	@rhiannon_louise not kidding, oddly. And right now I am sat in my flat waiting for my woman to make me coffee. How's your life going?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-09 00:29:37	The irony is that GoDaddy is so slow that I can't actually transfer the files off their motherfucking server, the motherfuckers.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-09 00:34:17	@rhiannon_louise Who does 12.5 hour shifts? Honestly. (Admittedly some days I'll be away from home for 14hrs, but 3 of those are commuting!)
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-09 00:35:15	@lenire Honestly. GoDaddy. Fucking GODADDY. I found out 170,000 sites were on the same server as our new site today. 170 THOUSAND.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-09 00:58:27	@lenire Yeah, I know how it works. But still... that's higher than it should be by a long way. Too high for error to be the only factor.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-09 00:36:18	@lenire And then they tried claiming the site's admin panel was slow because I hadn't optimised the site. IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A PAGE YET.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-09 00:39:32	@lenire In comparison, the new server I'm using from Bluehost only has 106. 

Fuck GoDaddy. Fuck them in the ass.

With a shovel.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-09 00:43:52	@lenire Look at the results of a reverseIP lookup on the GoDaddy account: http://t.co/Zr6GmB13Pq

104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-10 15:14:50	@calor_gas_terry I feel your pain. Musicals and pantomimes are the two things I loathe more than anything else.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-10 17:42:47	@seecarlashoot You used dust removal/digital ICE, didn't you? :P
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-10 17:46:34	@seecarlashoot No, but black and white film does. Look at the top half of the columns; that's why scanning B&amp;W film disables Digital ICE.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-11 12:45:56	@herdyshepherd1 Surely that'd mean Floss would have to go on maternity leave for a while? Wouldn't that be an issue?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-11 12:57:40	@shawnhoke @fmanjoo modern industrialised processes are why I became vegetarian, too. It's a horrid industry.

Also, yes.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-11 20:24:53	@bnystedt @dominik_mrzyk A black one would be lovely, agreed. I don't use SLRs enough to justify the elevated price, though.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-13 23:19:16	@dominik_mrzyk then get a zorki 1. Cheap and great. Hell, if you want to borrow one, let me get mine back and send it to you.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-14 00:02:19	@inmono101 @dominik_mrzyk Canon 7's viewfinder is good, but I'd prefer tiny viewfinder and tiny body over big viewfinder and big body.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-14 00:04:31	@inmono101 @dominik_mrzyk I know, I know. But it's just big and japanese and blergh.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-14 00:07:12	@inmono101 @dominik_mrzyk Nah. The CL feels horrible in the hand to me. Too square and angular.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-14 00:08:31	@inmono101 @dominik_mrzyk Overpriced, viewfinder ain't great if you wear glasses. Also, the M5 has a better meter and VF. And is cheaper.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-14 00:10:01	@inmono101 @dominik_mrzyk Naaaaah. Just different.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-14 00:14:30	@inmono101 @dominik_mrzyk The IIIf is basically everything I want... although the IIIg is tempting. M is over-rated in my eyes.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-14 00:18:14	@inmono101 @dominik_mrzyk It is, but if the body doesn't suit your needs, it'll just get in the way. I actually don't enjoy M finders much.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-14 00:21:43	@inmono101 @dominik_mrzyk No, same problem. Big body, cluttered finder. Also, I like separate high-mag RF patches. Easier to focus.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-14 19:25:48	@ShellySometimes give me a time stamp and I'll make that into a shareable infographic.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-14 00:31:56	@inmono101 @dominik_mrzyk I have a IIIf that I love. Why on earth would I want a bloody GX?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-14 00:39:53	@inmono101 My man @dominik_mrzyk thinks the Barnack viewfinder in a Zorki is too small. I say it's just nice and compact.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-18 17:09:53	@viewfinder_m6 @calor_gas_terry nah, they're quite common. And if you get one of those and the 3.5 Summaron, you have a matching A36 set!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-18 17:11:03	@dominik_mrzyk @jasonepowell @calor_gas_terry I used a jupiter 12 on my Canon 7 and it was noticeably off focus. Bang on with a Fed, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-19 23:40:55	Sorry London, but I think I'm going to stay here in Berlin; #alexanderplatz is my new favourite place… http://t.co/L0z44dxU3Q
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-19 23:42:24	@lenire I've found your new favourite shop. http://t.co/DqQtBkuIn4
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-19 23:58:10	@TimeForTeaBlog1 I almost wish I could. The reliance on meat and bread everywhere and lack of Georgie is a downside, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-20 00:02:05	@cloudyimages can't you just slot an equivalent traditional viewfinder in the accessory shoe? (But yes, that bullshit is dumb)
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-20 00:06:40	@TimeForTeaBlog1 @TwiningsTeaUK strange you say it's orangey... Being as lady grey is earl grey with added lemon.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-20 00:07:17	@lenire apparently, they can't find it. They put it in a dollhouse with the other miniatures and they've lost it.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-20 00:11:58	@TheAgeOfAnalog @lenire someone probably thought it was 90% off. Simon, you should tell them it started out at that size.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-20 00:12:41	@TimeForTeaBlog1 I have to admit I have a secret love of @TwiningsTeaUK's Lady Grey. Bloody good tea for a special occasion.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-20 00:23:49	@dominik_mrzyk I never thought I'd say this, but kick Ada to the curb. Skating comes first! (Boards before bros before hoes)

104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-23 15:04:53	@The_Old_Penfold I know, I'm totally against the fisheye. It was kinda necessary in that tiny space, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-22 21:52:41	@craigatkinson Yus. What do you need?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-22 21:54:32	@craigatkinson @rafael_garcia Looks like it imports it in colour. Odd.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-22 21:55:36	@craigatkinson @rafael_garcia Hm. Who knows?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-22 22:16:26	@HamishGill And so you're testing it under artificial light that turns photos yellow anyway? NICE ONE.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-22 22:19:25	@HamishGill Also: if you're testing colour rendition, the only way to accurately do it is with slide film which wouldn't work in that light.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-22 22:36:12	@HamishGill It won't prove anything, even roughly. You'd need daylight at least. Do it outside!

104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-23 04:01:57	Georgie went to bed four hours ago. I said I wouldn't be long... and then I started editing video from Berlin.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-23 04:20:18	@ShellySometimes It's okay, Shelly. I'll always love you.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-23 04:27:17	@ShellySometimes Seriously, though. Impossible sucks, you rule, and those photos look awesome.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-23 04:27:49	This video is going to be so rad that it will force even the most straight-laced person to use the word rad.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-23 04:35:22	@ShellySometimes You don't drink now? Shelly, this internet relationship might struggle under the strain of that revelation.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-29 19:19:31	.@dominik_mrzyk @JuloPeter The idea that uncoated lenses can't be sharp and flare-free is a myth. Condition is EVERYTHING.

BAHAHAHA
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-31 01:15:45	@ShellySometimes Georgie read that out to me and I wondered where she'd dug up that tired old quote. And YOU shared it! You've let me down.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-31 01:17:41	@ShellySometimes I can think of much more accurate things to call her.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-30 12:38:48	Straw poll: if someone said to you "never mind the bollocks", would you understand the reference?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-30 12:53:37	I should state - regarding my previous tweet - that there's a young whippersnapper in the office who doesn't recognise the album title.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-01-30 12:55:04	And neither myself nor the guy sitting opposite me can believe ANYONE wouldn't know the relevance of "Never Mind the Bollocks".

104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-02 14:45:26	@cloudyimages the 1:1 finder? Good man. I might be heading to MW on Wednesday if you want to tag along?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-02 14:49:51	@cloudyimages Well, what time do you finish work?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-02 14:53:38	@cloudyimages Yeah, they have one. £39. Clean chrome, clear glass, "many line scratches visible." Might be worth a look.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-02 14:54:08	@cloudyimages Actually, no. The photo of it looks like the scratches are pretty noticeable....!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-02 14:56:06	@cloudyimages Actually, scratch anything. The one thing I wanted has sold. Cock and bugger. :(
104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-02 14:58:09	@cloudyimages Yeah, I wouldn't buy anything from them if I could help it. I don't have more money than sense.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-02 14:59:09	@cloudyimages Peter Loy has a SBOOI 5cm finder for £69. Bargain.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-02 15:13:55	@cloudyimages I'll have to swing by after work one night. It's been too long.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-03 13:28:33	@cloudyimages Bloody hell. That was fast turnaround! Is the finder in good shape?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-03 13:32:07	@ZDP189 I can picture a pull-out and fold-out hotshoe. After all. The hotshoe plate is about as thick as a phone.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-03 16:20:56	@jasonepowell What's happening there?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-03 17:48:17	@NMatosPDX If everything's in good shape, yes. You'd probably pay around £500 for that setup over here.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-03 19:20:25	@cloudyimages a vast improvement over the little squinty finder it comes with, huh?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-03 19:24:45	@cloudyimages keep it for when you want to play with soviet lenses that just don't work with Leicas.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-09 12:01:30	@HamishGill it fits so well that it looks like it was designed for the Leica.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-10 23:38:45	@viewfinder_m6 @cloudyimages It's good. Minimal grain, wider range of tones than Tri-X. More pleasing curve.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-10 13:10:26	@cloudyimages I like the A36 filters because they're so quick to take on and off. Perfect for one shot - you don't leave them on for ages!

104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-11 16:33:55	@cloudyimages Generally, you mix powder with water to make 1 litre of stock. Then you can dev at stock strength or dilute.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-02-11 16:41:11	@cloudyimages If you've got 1l of stock, diluted 1:3, that makes 4l of one-shot developer; each 300ml needs to be thrown away after use.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-06 15:03:06	@jasonepowell I can't actually run a new version of Safari because I'm still on Snow Leopard. Hello security holes!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-06 15:07:36	@lancekingphoto @firefox Camino was really the last one standing with that distinction, as far as I'm aware.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-06 15:10:01	@dominik_mrzyk Opera is ugly as shit but might end up being my last resort.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-06 15:13:20	@dominik_mrzyk @jasonepowell 
&gt; Only problem
&gt; Flash

This is true about all browsers, systems, devices, existences....
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-06 15:26:17	@jasonepowell @dominik_mrzyk can I get an Amen!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-06 18:16:54	Sometimes I can't tell if people are joking or if they're really that painfully stupid.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-05 22:38:41	That beautiful moment when, six months after taking over a website, you're still finding problems caused by the previous "webmaster". ARGHHH
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-05 23:04:33	@jasonepowell More like "incompetent buffoon whose lingering shadow continues to make my life hell".
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-06 01:11:25	Just went to get into bed and found this on the back of my calf.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-08 14:55:12	@pdexposures I thought it was at 4pm GMT? Ah... Fuck.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-08 16:33:20	So that was fun. #pdexposures50
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-08 17:49:16	@patrickjclarke @pdexposures thanks for getting involved!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-09 11:27:26	@samsnch @lenire I have, yes; it's nice but the Mac version gets very little development. It's on 4.5.1 and the windows one is 6.x now.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-09 11:37:30	@Uncl3Rick Oh my. And I thought I had it bad.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-09 01:07:36	My 2008 Macbook can't run anything newer than Snow Leopard &amp; so it's being shut out of the browser game. Right now it's Firefox or nothing.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-09 01:08:08	I can't even run Opera because the latest builds are OSX 10.7+ only. And Safari hasn't had a security patch for Snow Leopard in AGES. Gah.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-09 12:45:59	I feel like @xkcdcomic really understands modern photography projects, whether 365, selfie-orientated or otherwise: http://t.co/YYXlzOoNv4
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-09 15:54:29	@yeknom The second people started calling it "analog photography" instead of "film photography" - or even just "photography".
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-09 15:59:23	@eugenbaban @yeknom My problem is not the use of the word, but where it came from and what that implies... But that's an old rant now.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-09 16:07:56	@eugenbaban @yeknom that's not true at all. If it was, I could call you the n-word without feeling terrible or looking like a dick.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-09 00:26:56	@lenire Yeah, I saw that. Interesting, but the fact it's built on Chromium and not WebKit/Gecko worries me. Chromium is RAM-thirsty.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-09 00:29:28	@lenire I saw this mentioned in the article though... totally giving this a spin.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-09 01:10:15	Every so often I fire up @caminobrowser and remember how great it was; fast, simple - and not a memory hog. It's what @firefox SHOULD be.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-10 13:49:38	@amanda_raney But do you have a dozen cousins?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-10 19:29:32	Was looking through clips on my phone and found these from my first session with the ciruskateboard.… https://t.co/XAfjqeR5zX
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-11 10:26:57	.@ShellySometimes but Shelly, don't you know that idiots only ever want the same stories over and over again (see: comic book films)?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-11 17:56:17	@lenire @jasonepowell @pdexposures I personally would never want 2hr+ episodes. That's just unnecessary and masturbatory.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-11 17:59:38	@jasonepowell @lenire @pdexposures just to avoid length creep. We don't want to end up with 3.5hr long pointless epics full of bullshit.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-12 00:12:42	@patrickjclarke @lenire @NMatosPDX @pdexposures I blatantly have the best accent.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-12 11:30:51	@seecarlashoot I think you're right; I imagine he was a coffee drinker, for some reason.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-12 13:25:01	@lancekingphoto @uncl3rick That's a common problem from the Grunge era.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-12 15:16:28	@JoeyPascoPhoto I generally wind the film back in the cassette to tighten it around the spool then dismantle.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-12 15:34:35	The one downside of working from home is that there's no one around to hear the epic Dr Pepper-fuelled burps.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-12 15:47:15	A special treat for @ShellySometimes. http://t.co/CCE3REMU1o
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-12 15:49:52	@jasonepowell @ShellySometimes why would you unfave it, Jason? Why?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-12 16:45:00	@patrickjclarke @lenire @seecarlashoot She did know that, thankfully. But still...

How is that even possible?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-12 13:23:39	@lancekingphoto @uncl3rick Not Billy Corgan?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-13 10:16:48	@samsnch @shellysometimes You missed the most obvious one.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-12 15:16:41	@JoeyPascoPhoto Pulling it through the window might scratch it if you've not got the angle right.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-12 15:25:45	@JoeyPascoPhoto Oh, cut it off. That thing is in there for good unless you pull the film all the way through the slot (which you can't).
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-12 15:55:39	@paulbarden @shellysometimes I am nothing if not classy.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-12 16:24:09	Why would anyone follow these stupid bloody accounts? “@PicPedant: @AmazedByAnimals's same lion pics every 3 weeks: https://t.co/2rKDxCkIDW”

104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-13 13:50:06	@ZDP189 @samsnch And now I half-want a IIIG again. Thanks, Dan.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-13 14:53:12	@lenire @samsnch @zdp189 I don't really. I'm not about to buy any new cameras. But the IIIG certainly IS very nice.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-13 17:07:09	It's been a while, but here's a new #freestyletricktip - how to go from #casper to rail.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-16 21:33:14	@NMatosPDX @drshitlord @shellysometimes Google+ is great for photography. Lots of communities and a good layout for viewing images.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-16 21:36:56	@ShellySometimes @nmatospdx @drshitlord Anyway, all social media is bullshit, viewing photos on a screen sucks, I hate everything, fuck off.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-15 15:48:50	It feels like this winter is never going to end; there's still supposed to be two hours of daylight… https://t.co/s5jODBexP9

104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-17 00:17:19	@jasonepowell just one. Learned it five minutes earlier within five goes. Stationary tricks are easy (but don't tell anyone, sssh).
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-17 00:20:58	@jasonepowell the basic skills (the 50-50 truck stand, the casper and the sidewinder) take ages to learn. New combinations are easy, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-17 01:26:09	@cloudyimages it just occurred to me that you won't have seen the full video as you don't have facebook: https://t.co/TguLZ7zM39
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-17 01:43:41	Generally, I really hate Youtube's default screenshots when you upload a video. Dead pleased with this one, though. http://t.co/aozrnNgYkm

104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-18 20:50:02	@NMatosPDX @patrickjclarke not necessarily. RF portrait lenses are compact, easy to focus and AMAZING.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-18 21:20:52	@NMatosPDX @patrickjclarke the solution? SEROO 1:1 finder. Better than any SLR viewfinder for 90mm. http://t.co/orVRTI20Qp
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-18 21:21:50	@jasonepowell @NMatosPDX @patrickjclarke and the solution to that.... http://t.co/14RMQ5N7Xz
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-17 14:51:08	I made a video, and it has some #skateboarding in it: https://t.co/jhw2MQuBzc

(Actually, it's all skateboarding. Very 80s skateboarding.)
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-17 15:10:17	@lenire It was far too fucking cold for the short shorts and vests.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-17 15:11:38	@lenire It's one of these: http://t.co/n6PBz2QUEs
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-17 15:13:24	@lenire Were you sat in a car at the time? Because if so, I'd say that lazy.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-17 15:38:31	@TimeForTeaBlog1 this is why all those "viral" websites and twitter accounts should be ignored: http://t.co/8xh4kNeFBh

104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-19 14:51:07	This article - http://t.co/l9u65K7014 - is a fantastic analysis of middle class obsessions with twee imagery. http://t.co/hZBuVVEZE0
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-19 14:51:56	Living in the most middle class town in England, I see this reactionary "cupcake fascism" on a daily basis. It's painful.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-19 19:11:01	@dominik_mrzyk Yay, expired 35mm film! Isn't it great? SO cheap! And then fucked colours and grain you'll complain about! YAY!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-17 22:07:25	I'm quite a fan of this little #freestyle sequence. #freestyleskateboarding #skateboarding https://t.co/YusnCLABid
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-18 01:37:03	@jasonepowell yeah... That's why I stopped using Stainless, which was built on the same code. Even more RAM hungry than Firefox.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-22 20:11:27	@lenire because it's shit.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-22 21:18:26	This week's @Pdexposures will probably divide the audience into pro-Tony and anti-Tony camps even further. Looking forward to the fallout.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-22 22:21:58	@barneymccann did you ever play echochrome? Because that looks very similar. Might be worth you looking at.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-22 22:35:27	When your girlfriend takes up the dining table with her laptop, flat freestyle skateboards make great alternatives. http://t.co/0WQZA49AEk
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-22 23:12:21	@barneymccann playstation 3 or psp. I have the PS3 version, but might pick up the PSP one for commuting - it's only £2 on Amazon.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-23 18:41:51	@TimeForTeaBlog1 you have no idea.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-23 20:44:04	@barneymccann until recently I was in London a few times a week. Could be a while until I'm back in the big smoke now, though.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-23 10:40:51	@barneymccann And I'm doing alright, ta. Skating lots. Practicing for a big comp in Germany in the summer. How about you?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-23 20:44:17	@barneymccann where you living these days? Didn't you move fairly recently?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-23 12:13:35	@TimeForTeaBlog1 As if anyone in there even knows how to use a computer, much less Twitter.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-24 18:23:42	I know what I should do. I should shoot one frame of @Impossible_HQ's new film every single day. That sounds like an idea.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-25 17:58:57	@msemtd @seismicskate Best urethane I've ever skated, far as I'm concerned. Been using them exclusively for years and not one flatspot!

104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-24 16:27:27	@ChrisFecio :( I know, it's a tough sell. Guess people prioritise cheap over non-sweatshop American-made these days.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-24 16:29:42	@ChrisFecio The shorts are the best quality gear we have. They're so well-designed and hard wearing it's shocking.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-24 16:46:54	@ChrisFecio TOO jorty? Is there such a thing? #believeinjorts
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-24 17:47:27	@cloudyimages There's something not right with you. That was HILARIOUS.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-24 18:15:21	@DrShitlord Very much this. All of this. Entirely, completely this.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-24 18:16:11	Look at my fucking iPhone. LOOK AT IT
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-24 18:20:15	Have you seen @Impossible_HQ's new film? I'm so stoked to try out this new SX70 I found at Goodwill yesterday.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-26 11:27:39	@ZDP189 @lomography Hard not to when you're kickstarting an already finished product. It's different when they're not (remember Lomochrome?)
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-25 23:14:13	I'm more proud of this #footwork than any flip trick I've ever done. #freestyleskateboarding #skateboarding... https://t.co/hM62qZ4qY4

104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-26 14:33:56	@ellacumber And now I want hash browns. ALL THE HASH BROWNS.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-26 00:58:33	@adamsimonstweet I'd generally agree but I figure it's different when you (or someone you know) is personally invested in the brand!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-26 22:07:34	@IsaacLagarda @dominik_mrzyk yes; I'd stick with the 100 for Rodinal. Ask @cloudyimages, though - he used both Fomapans with Rodinal.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-26 19:30:03	@ShellySometimes I bet it'll oxidise and go brown as soon as you bite into it.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-26 19:41:52	@ShellySometimes That's not what I've heard. #sizequeen
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-26 20:28:12	@bibliosk8er what, no @pdexposures? Fuck you, Bob. Fuck you.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-26 20:30:23	@bibliosk8er But they're STUPID.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-26 20:33:29	@bibliosk8er It's okay. Neither does @lenire most of the time.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-26 20:37:18	@dominik_mrzyk Great idea. But try for Fomapan 400 just so you don't lose the speed.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-27 14:09:15	These scans from when I borrowed @cloudyimages' Leica Standard have been sat, unedited, on my desktop since October. http://t.co/v0QDV4MLu3
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-27 14:52:17	@herdyshepherd1 I'd love one of those. #TheShepherdsLife
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-28 01:38:44	@cloudyimages no, I was using the Summaron (35mm). I personally wouldn't scale focus a 50mm.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-27 16:10:08	About a year ago I went out to Vegas and finally got to #skate with @danieljtrujillo. We shot some… https://t.co/DmGN2CuWVH
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-28 02:19:59	Sliced my thumb open tonight. Thankfully, fingerflips have given me the skills to make a dressing out of hockey tape. http://t.co/1BO0ZNFcya
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-28 02:21:30	Skater first aid is the best first aid; dedicated skateboarders are like MacGyver when it comes to wounds and injuries.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-28 02:23:28	I once heard of an American skater who made a cast for his broken ankle out of duct tape instead of paying for an ER visit. My kinda guy.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-27 19:37:05	Another Leica Standard shot; a couple of them aren't that bad. A Standard and a Summaron is a pretty tidy combo. http://t.co/uWCr0ib4QV

104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-28 17:47:40	@jasonepowell even if the glass is terrible, this is still the best option for instant photography moving forward.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-28 19:37:04	Don't vote Conservative if you have a conscience (or a soul); leaked emails show they want to cut benefits further: http://t.co/7ZSqLY04qn
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-29 00:40:57	@patrickjclarke Yeah, that's exactly my position. Not a big fan of the mini format, but the TLR is very appealing.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-29 00:41:21	.@KristenWACamera I don't have the money right now but if I did I'd grab one instantly (hurhurhur).
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-29 16:46:44	@NMatosPDX Stop fucking around and send me those video files.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-29 16:52:22	@NMatosPDX What part of stop fucking around do you NOT UNDERSTAND
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-29 16:52:49	@nmatospdx Nah, seriously, though. 'salright.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-29 13:16:20	@samsnch What happened?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-31 17:59:39	Sad freestyle board is sad. So much for a post-work skate and this "British Summer Time" malarkey. 💦☔️ https://t.co/XW0HNP9DGH
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-31 13:06:43	@amanda_raney @comicsreporter I work with a guy who looks up every problem he has on youtube. It takes him twice as long to do ANYTHING.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-02 19:37:50	@cloudyimages It's more the train fare that I'm worried about!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-02 19:39:38	PURPOSE IS NOTHING

SPECTACLE IS EVERYTHING
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-02 09:32:09	@cloudyimages If you do, sell the 2.8. The 3.5 is much nicer.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-02 09:32:54	@cloudyimages also, an Elmar 3.5 + a Summaron 3.5 gives you an A36 set. You can even pick up a Summar f2 if you need speed and keep it A36!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-02 09:43:51	@cloudyimages Completely green and red for me. The constituency results were a shocker, though.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-02 09:45:38	So turns out that #TunbridgeWells - a Tory hotbed - actually prefers @UKLabour policies when parties aren't named. http://t.co/X3pR9eG2dw
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-02 09:47:21	The chart on the last tweet comes from http://t.co/J4nwBsyIPB, which is a fantastic idea and should probably be mandatory for all voters.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-02 10:01:08	@cloudyimages Oh, I know. That's how UKIP and the Conservatives keep winning seats!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-03-31 13:55:02	Wait... HOW LONG to ship to Canada? Go home, Royal Mail. You're drunk. http://t.co/bR9UDPuoLb
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-02 15:27:07	@cloudyimages I'll see what I can do. Don't really have the money these days to go galavanting around London!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-02 15:31:47	Maybe this is the start of a fledgling modelling career for me: http://t.co/WNTWdDThXv

104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-03 15:53:53	@Beckwould Considering one person has unfollowed me since the start of shouty slogan tweets, yes, I guess so.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-03 16:00:11	@Beckwould I'm trying to filter out all the Lomographers hiding in my follower list. Little insidious fuckers...
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-03 16:55:17	Sometimes, when it's raining and I can't go skateboarding, I entertain myself by writing daft product descriptions: http://t.co/cAw43blIKp

104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-02 22:20:08	@adamsimonstweet someone posted something "Lomographic" on facebook and the rhetoric acted as a trigger.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-04 19:03:14	@jasonepowell @TimeForTeaBlog1 I'm fine with that. I'm more interested in (and feel more affinity with) dancing than street skating.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-04 19:32:20	@jasonepowell @timeforteablog1 Have you seen the 360 kickflip variation that starts with a plié? Definite high point.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-06 20:11:08	@ChrisFecio @lenire I know the term, I'm just being overly literal.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-06 20:12:29	@ChrisFecio @lenire ...how would that work?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-08 19:37:26	@HamishGill wow; that's pure tumblr-bait right there.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-07 07:27:15	@sunnivaj no, that's just my face. Sorry to disappoint.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-08 19:38:58	@HamishGill my term for dreamy, slightly washed out C41 film images. Tumblr is full of them.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-08 19:42:10	@HamishGill they're great photos if you like that sort of thing.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-08 19:47:44	.@HamishGill @TheAgeOfAnalog good B&amp;W &gt; E6 &gt; bad B&amp;W &gt; C41 &gt; x-pro &gt; redscale &gt; expired film. You know it's true.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-08 19:53:20	Okay, maybe this is a better arrangement. The bottom end is too close to call; just different levels of shit.  https://t.co/QSQeyoCq8v

104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-08 19:56:44	@TomWelland @HamishGill @TheAgeOfAnalog depends if it's good or not. XP2 goes in the top band, BW400CN slips into the second band.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-08 20:43:30	@The_Old_Penfold @ShellySometimes my opinion is based on cold, hard facts. Namely the fact that C41 is SHIT.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-08 20:49:52	@ShellySometimes @The_Old_Penfold then tell Alex to stop being wrong!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-07 14:06:51	Realisation: The phrase "almost hometime" doesn't work when you're working from home. I have a linguistic deficiency for this situation.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-08 10:32:34	What's wrong with this world in one statement: too many people follow @AmazingPicx and not enough are following @ShellySometimes right now.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-08 14:14:43	So when business pays off a politician in China, the media calls it corruption, but when the same happens in America, it's "lobbying".
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-08 14:15:49	Every so often I realise just how bloody Orwellian modern society is, and I feel both nauseous and angry about it all.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-08 14:34:56	.@Uncl3Rick I sometimes feel like Twitter is the pressure release valve that allows this shit to continue.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-07 21:36:22	@jasonepowell skateboarding, obviously. Specifically freestyle skateboarding.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-10 15:31:03	@adamsimonstweet I'd like to point out that your retweet contradicts itself:

"feminism shouldn't centre men"
"gender isn't a binary"
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-10 16:01:51	@adamsimonstweet It bloody well is. Feminism can't exist without a gender binary. It relies on that binary to define itself.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-21 07:43:38	When someone uses "foul mouthed" as a criticism, I instantly disregard everything else they have to say.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-21 07:44:02	If someone saying fuck or shit really offends you that much, your priorities and critical faculties obviously aren't worth much.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-21 11:05:59	@TimeForTeaBlog1 odd day. Woke up to a comment on @pdexposures calling me a foul mouthed idiot and got to work to find I'm locked out.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-20 16:49:02	@bibliosk8er flow and slow tricks are fine. I just find that the more fiddly the trick, the less likely it is to work under pressure.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-28 11:51:15	@ZDP189 That's why I can't part with my Soviet RFs. I used them all the way through university, and the memories are worth more than money.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-28 12:15:29	@cloudyimages Don't buy Lenovo anything. Lenovo's stuff is pretty shit. Dad has to fix loads of them.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-28 12:19:15	@cloudyimages Personally, I'd suggest Mac if you can stretch to it. My Macbook is still going strong and I bought it in 2008!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-28 12:25:30	@cloudyimages Think of it like buying a camera. You can buy cheap, but you'll be replacing it more often. Go for the Leica every time. ;)

104572011	coldkennels	2015-04-29 15:40:55	@JSodPhotography @lenire What, descaling? A hydrochloric acid dilution, boiled, would work wonders. (Scale is normally Calcium Carbonate.)

104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-03 14:57:03	@adamsimonstweet in all seriousness, I'm using Twitter a LOT less nowadays.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-03 15:05:52	@adamsimonstweet nah, just checking in less and less. Always working or skating now.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-07 08:59:19	@ujhphoto yeah - the selenium is usually fine. The lock system is normally what knackers the IV and V. Aim for a III instead. More solid.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-06 20:45:43	@twcuddleston it's almost as if ensuring the young aren't politically aware is their intention... Probably scared of another 1968.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-07 13:35:59	@ujhphoto if memory serves, the II and III are both slightly smaller than the IV, V &amp; Euromaster. Those later models use a fat plastic body.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-07 13:40:06	@ujhphoto no worries. Remind me at the weekend and I'll get a comparison photo for you.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-07 14:55:06	@dfdy_ @ujhphoto @hamishgill Yeah, the II and III are stunning meters - really well made. The IV &amp; V feel like cheap plastic in comparison.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-07 15:24:45	@HamishGill @dfdy_ @ujhphoto Have you ever dismantled all the Westons? The IV and V are noticeably shoddier.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-07 15:25:43	@HamishGill @dfdy_ @ujhphoto Which is?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-08 07:45:31	@ujhphoto this is the Murdoch-owned media's fault. They've been VICIOUSLY anti-Labour.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-12 14:03:25	@cloudyimages No, not at all. They're not stable at speeds. Skateboards are actually safer once you learn how to ride one.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-12 14:05:50	@cloudyimages Also, when skateboarding you can carry a bag, a cup of coffee, a Leica... the joys of handsfree commuting!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-12 14:07:42	@cloudyimages Give it time and practice, mate!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-12 14:44:08	I just found out how much it costs to run a full page ad in the Evening Standard and cried a little bit.

Advertising is expensive.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-12 14:49:05	.@samsnch That's nothing. £70,000 for a full pager in a free London newspaper. SEVENTY THOUSAND.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-12 14:50:42	@samsnch I don't think you could even buy a boxroom in London for that much!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-12 14:52:36	@samsnch SOLD. Just let me get a mortgage and I'm there.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-13 09:53:32	@samsnch I'm slightly envious. I've wanted one of those adapters for years.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-13 11:09:22	@samsnch Also, cheaper lenses! Hurrah!
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-13 12:03:12	@samsnch The Jupiter 11 is the 135/4 (which is fantastic, and focuses to 1.5m in Kiev compared to 2.5m in LTM). You're thinking of the J-12.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-13 12:05:18	@samsnch The Jupiter 12's alright, but LTM won't focus on a Leica and Kiev won't mount on an Amedeo. Sad face.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-13 12:09:28	@samsnch The J12 won't fit on the Amedeo because of the rear element. J9 &amp; J11, being portrait/tele lenses, will. https://t.co/KBoEuLRqNb
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-13 12:20:04	@samsnch Then grab a Jupiter 11! I love the 135mm. And they're dirt cheap!

104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-16 12:46:08	@ujhphoto just remembered I was going to send you a Weston comparison. I was wrong - the late ones are smaller. http://t.co/Orjss32150
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-16 12:47:50	@ujhphoto they're noticeably less well built and less informative, though. The II and III cover all half stops and speeds.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-16 12:49:11	@ujhphoto oh - just saw you got a II! You figure out the Weston speed to ISO conversion okay? That throws some people.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-16 12:51:55	@ujhphoto no need - Weston speeds are either the one just below ISO (80 Weston = 100 ISO) or one further, depending on age of meter.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-16 12:52:35	@ujhphoto my II is 64 Weston to 100 ISO. The III and later is 80 to 100.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-15 13:08:25	@cloudyimages I lol'd.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-17 15:19:11	@cloudyimages the taller one is the FILCA, which only fits screwmounts. The shorter is the IXMOO, which fits both.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-20 17:59:27	@ujhphoto @yeknom @lenire I just pretend he's the sound technician who isn't allowed a mix of his own. That makes his quietness tolerable.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-20 18:00:17	@TimeForTeaBlog1 ...you know what I'm going to ask, right?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-20 18:47:38	@lenire I'm still stressing out about the first trick. I've chosen to open with a brand new, ridiculously difficult trick as a statement.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-20 18:48:22	@lenire no one else has ever done it before, so it's a huge opening gambit. If I pull it off perfectly, it should get some attention.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-20 18:04:11	@TimeForTeaBlog1 WHAT.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-20 18:06:35	@lenire first event is this weekend - jam session. First competition is the 13/14th of June, and I'm bricking it.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-20 18:31:18	@lenire it's a mildly more polite way of saying you're nervously shitting yourself.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-20 18:56:34	@lenire no, been keeping it to my chest since I first did it. Filmed it but only three people have seen the footage.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-21 22:03:09	Just gave my girlfriend a potted history of 20th century economics and Keynes vs Friedman. 

I'm not sure how much sunk in, to be honest.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-21 22:03:34	What Georgie doesn't know is there'll be a written test tomorrow, so I hope she was at least taking notes.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-21 22:04:22	@DrShitlord I am a coeliac, yes. Tough to give recommendations, though... London is a BIG place. I know some great places in Hammersmith...?
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-22 09:38:05	@cloudyimages good shout - it's just easier to get started pre-popping and pre-bag.
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-22 09:35:37	@cloudyimages I respool from one to the other. Just recut the leader, thread it into the FILCA's spool, and load it in the dark bag.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-26 10:43:51	So, Twitter, you let me down for the first time last night. Any passing Entomologists know what this #beetle is? http://t.co/iLDGqA6V67
104572011	coldkennels	2015-05-26 11:05:55	@ArneKuilman That's what @ujhphoto suggested. I don't think I've ever seen one before now.

I hope you're at least using lube.

104572011	coldkennels	2015-06-03 20:53:02	@lenire I'll actually be in London tomorrow. Big place, though. Sure they'll find enough hooligans on their own, anyway.
