107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-01-23 23:44:21	Just cracked the ending - needed another rhythm pattern with nothing but a crash in it - well rounded off.

107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-01-23 23:58:37	@mgardot Loving your album Worrisome Heart.  Can't believe I missed your Edinburgh gig in november 09.  Come back to Queens Hall soon.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-01-24 12:33:07	Hurrah!  Finished first draft of drums and stitched em into a song. Put down a guide bass line, and can tweak the drums later - cooking!

107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-02-09 18:20:56	first trumpet lesson on Thursday - getting some practice in beforehand.  not sounding too bad today.  Like my Bye Bye Blackbird after Miles
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-02-09 21:05:28	Started drums for choral version of No Toxic Elements, but under the weather and didn't capture what I wanted. keen to try making choir.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-01-25 15:20:25	Busy w/end working on orchestral arrangement - agonised over ground bass, eventually used a bass sound after trying all else - genius.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-01-25 15:22:06	Dash, no big lotto win - back to work tomorrow, music gear packed away until next time [ 8o(  - still, hope to start trumpet lessons soon.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-01-25 16:42:07	Just added a new blog post on The Story So Far http://ning.it/4ZzsTV
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-02-24 21:31:49	First trumpet lesson went well - use air and do not pinch.  Getting better sound but need to control breath afresh.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-03-04 21:15:02	Another good lesson - blew up a storm, great to play wiv another trumpeter - raised my game.  Belly muscles getting a good workout [ 8 0 )
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-03-18 21:48:01	Teacher says my endurance has improved a lot already - good to play along with another horn guy again.  We will probably record next week.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-03-21 12:33:55	Check out bluesy singer-songwriter Mo Medicine at the Tron open-mic in Edinburgh, and on Myspace.  No easy answers!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-03-21 13:26:08	Just tried flatwound strings on the Ibanez hollow body bass for the first time - amazing! Smooth to play, great thumpy 60s Beatley sound.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-03-23 21:42:47	Blowing with the belly is definitely helping muscle definition of the stomach area - not quite a six pack, but vague glimmerings.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-03-18 21:49:23	Jazz recommendation - Dan Berglund's Tonbruket.  Bass man from EST, fine gig last Saturday and a gent to speak to afterwards.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-03-21 14:38:31	#nowplaying - Roy Hargrove Big Band CD Emergence with guest vocalist Roberta Gambarini - great moment when she drops down low to sing por ti
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-03-21 18:57:57	French movie recommendation - Gallic lunacy and inventiveness - Micmacs - another storming film from Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Merveilleux!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-04-02 16:19:53	Just back from a week in Lanzarote - superb!  Can't blow trumpet as got a cracked lip from the heat - nonsuperb.  Loved The Carnaby Girls!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-04-02 16:26:05	Today Jesus would be amazed that people still talk about him. We live and die the same as we did then - the world is no better for his death
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-04-03 14:12:14	Just watched Seinfeld ep The Yada Yada for the first time -great idea, it is Twitter all over. Today I got up, yada yada yada, I tweeted.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-04-05 20:35:20	Good day recording rhythm guitar for Mirrors Don't Lie.  Brings the track to life. Thinned out drums in the slow part - now working on bass.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-04-05 20:37:19	First go on trumpet since holiday in Lanzarote - blowing more gently as Teach advised.  Sounding good - will record trumpet at weekend.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-05-04 20:21:58	Probs with PC, can hardly be bothered with it. Also big domestic project = no recording yet. Played trumpet in empty church - that was cool.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-07-12 16:03:20	Too busy recording to learn Spanish anthem - never mind. Not happy with tracks - will work on parts this week and record again Saturday.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-07-05 09:37:49	Old horn had a sweet sound but a lot of red rot. I gave it the best clean it's had in years, but it still tasted funny. thanx but no thanx.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-07-20 15:42:21	Good lesson y'day.  Noticed column of air coming from Teacher's horn, so will record with bell pointing to left of mic so air bypasses mic
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-07-26 09:49:45	My only concern with new method is mutes falling out. Want to get Jo-Ral copper bottom mute, but I hear it's quite heavy - would it stay in?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-07-19 09:48:53	moved some bits up and octave - an improvement, but I seem to be recording air.  Need to get more comfortable getting up there as well.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-07-22 07:47:45	Groo! struggled with horn y'day after a hard session of swimming.  No energy for blowing, lot of cracked notes.  buzzed m'piece for a while.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-07-30 09:07:42	Jazz Festival!  Come to Edinburgh.  Hope to see some hot playing over the next week - might inspire my own. Bap bam a lee bam!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-07-24 17:20:33	Trying horn pointing down a little instead of sticking straight out. good results buzzing  mpiece and now with horn. this could be my way!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-07-29 07:52:44	Edinburgh jazz festival starts tomorrow. Can't wait - hope to see 5 or 6 gigs.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-06-17 12:06:11	Got a cold now - trumpet hard work, but trying Like a Hurricane in 2 keys and one at breakneck speed.  Interesting and giddying.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-06-21 15:03:03	Can't shake the cold. Like a Hurricane is hard at speed with some tricky intervals, specially when a bit breathless  &lt;gasp&gt;.  lesson today!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-05-13 14:19:17	Yay!  Good sesh recording trumpet, with reflexion filter. will try next weekend without filter and play around with reverb etc. Progress!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-05-14 11:10:52	Fine lesson yesterday - Teach says my tone is coming on a lot.  Hit some good high notes under my new style that I lost when I changed over.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-05-17 09:05:00	tired last night but wanted to play trumpet - tried lying down on the bed - no good, the water runs back down the mouthpiece and you gurgle
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-05-19 12:55:04	My task is to play Twinkle Twinkle in 3 keys and 3 different styles - trying for brass band, Miles Davis and wild wah-wah.  crazy sounds.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-08-18 07:48:29	Arroo! What a jazz festival. Saw 8 very different gigs, plus Mardi Gras. S Hallkvist, Doigts de l'homme, French National Jazz Orch, etc.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-08-18 07:51:35	Great to see 5 teenagers playing jazz, Siobhan Duncan quintet, well done to you. Also good stuff from Tom Bancroft and Laura MacDonald.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-08-19 08:53:00	been away, 2 weeks without horn. but new method of pointing horn down a bit feels quite natural after a break, felt blowing easily Weds.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-08-20 09:31:57	Ah, getting back into the horn groove.  Like the new method.  Paloma Faith album is excellent, look forward to gig in November.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-08-24 08:48:14	In Inverness for work Sunday - Mon.  Missed the trumpet loads.  Read Humphrey Lyttleton's Best of Jazz - made me miss it all the more.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-08-25 11:28:02	Aaaahhh! Back to the trumpet. My favourite tune at the moment is LVB's Ode To Joy. Challenging to fit in breaths during the long meolody.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-06-29 07:49:42	Patchy lesson - the fast Hurricane didn't really come off due to breathing probs. Played German anthem during Emgland WC game 8o).
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-06-30 08:58:05	Pooped - did 5k jogscotland event around beautiful botanic gardens in edinburgh last night. not run for a while.  will help trumpet stamina?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-07-01 07:52:09	enjoying book of jazz studies - only just started, but I feel the swing.  Getting a look at an old trumpet, might buy if it looks OK.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-07-06 10:11:56	good lesson - long tones as a warm up help to zen out, focus on all the elements without clenching the belly.15 seconds can seem a long time
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-07-09 15:43:47	I should have a go at learning the Spanish anthem on the trumpet before the big game on Sunday, but it sounds a bit fussy.  tal vez...
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-05-24 11:28:44	Recordings of Teacher  - he sounds like Hendrix when he plays with fx pedals on his trumpet. Awesome. Will try mine with flanger + plunger.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-06-02 14:24:27	Loved playing Twinkle with crazy wah wah sounds. Teacher liked my use of mutes and bluesy minors. Now to do 3 versions of tune of my choice.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-06-04 07:44:37	Drat hay fever - shortness of breath don't go with trumpet playing. Hard to squeeze out a note. trying to play Aus national anthem superfast
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-08-30 11:13:51	Ah, Guitar Guitar in Edinburgh - so many basses, Tanglewood, Hofner, Epiphone, Rickenbacker - after playing many, I'm happy with mine. growl
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-08-30 11:52:11	...so, if no more basses, maybe I should think about a cornet.  It would be too sad to never buy another instrument of any kind.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-09-09 15:09:55	Ah, good clip on Soulo mute website - trumpet guy plays side on to the mic - avoidng the 'column of air' effect? Must..try..soon..
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-08-31 14:38:13	Anyone tried the Soulomute, as featured at the Oscars? http://www.soulomute.com/?gclid=COqPpvzn46MCFYZo4wod2CmKZA
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-09-01 10:10:36	My home pc takes so long to start and to do anything that I can easily combine trumpet practice with browsing. Handy!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-09-02 16:02:12	My method might be about to pay dividends - ran up to G above the stave last night, and with practice mute in. try free blowing tonight.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-09-03 14:27:05	I'm liking these high notes - but trick is to play them at will. I feel I am getting there though. Keen to record soon...
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-10-06 08:14:22	Working on the 'Ta', nice to hear it back. Don't neglect the 'phew' for Miles Davis stylee tho. This trumpet work is tricky. Great tho.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-10-06 15:20:19	Can't stop playing Red Allen CD. Who stole the lock on the hen house door? Great range of tunes from trad to bebop, lit up by his horn.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-09-13 13:48:01	Listening to top trumpeter Henry Red Allen CD 'Ride, Red, Ride'.  Great attack, his playing has been well described as peppery.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-10-11 14:31:41	Tried to record trumpet & vocals on Friday - no good. Workmen at front of house and more at the back - too much hammering and drilling [ 80(
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-09-24 11:38:44	H'mmm. drawback to my method - I've lost the low register.  Need to see teacher next week for guidance and help.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-10-15 14:13:40	Off to see Scottish National Jazz Orchestra tonight, playing the music of ECM, with bass player Arild Andersen - can't wait!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-10-15 14:15:46	@rikusora I hope your gig went well.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-10-18 13:56:21	Top class gig on Friday, Arild Andersen ace on bass. Great to hear double bass so prominently for a change.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-09-30 15:48:20	First lesson for a few weeks today - got a bit of a sore throat and breathlessness - these things don't bother me when I play bass [ 8o(
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-10-04 14:54:30	Lesson went quite well, but I've lost my 'Ta' and gone to 'Phew'. Must get the 'Ta' back for attack and high notes.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-10-28 13:50:42	Good session yesterday - picked up trumpet and played one of my tunes without warm up, hit the notes spot on. muscle memory developing?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-11-04 09:16:55	Excellent gig on Tuesday - Paloma Faith, supported by Eliza Doolittle. Two very different bands, both top notch.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-11-05 15:01:25	Good work in the last week recording trumpet and vocals. Some songs on the web soon. The Story So Far!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-11-10 10:12:22	Fine jazz gig last night - Pascal Schumacher 4tet with ace sax man Konrad Wiesniewski as special guest. Nice vibes based jazz.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-11-15 09:13:45	Pfffparppfft! The sound of the trumpet when it has a big bit of toast crumb inside it. The thing's hard enough to play without that.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-01 12:45:53	Oooyah! Few things are colder than a mouthpiece against the lips. But few things warm you up quicker than playing the trumpet.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-11-18 08:51:46	woo-hoo! Think I found the right combo of mic/pre-amp/level/insert/distance for the trumpet and have some keeper takes. at last...
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-11-19 10:49:34	Good lesson yesterday - warm up exercise for cold days, played thru South East Corner, worked on articulation of the phrases. Record!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-05 12:12:25	Where is my guitar?  Frozen in a depot? Must play some blues on the horn to lament my lost axe.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-05 13:30:39	Playing trumpet, even tho not very well as I've hurt my back shovelling snow and breaking ice, worked - guitar has arrived!  Will open soon.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-05 15:14:27	But wait - according to the info printed on the box it's the wrong guitar, Gromit.  box says electro acoustic not jazz.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-11-22 14:47:05	good recording y'day. tried teacher's suggestion of hitting high E in 2nd part of SEC phrase - hit it well, sounds good. SEC near done.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-11-22 14:51:06	Excellent giig on Friday - Lulo Reinhardt Gypsy Swing. Top notch playing all round. Been a vintage year for live music.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-06 10:12:15	Relief! Outer box was just packaging to protect my new baby. Inside was the gloss blue Tanglewood TSB59 I've been waiting for. Gorgeous.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-06 10:15:43	Pity the poor jazzer booked for a small venue in this weather. Even if you make it to the venue, will the audience bother to come out?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-06 16:53:56	How great is that guitar? Gave it a try-out before it's wrapped up for Xmas.  Awesome! Can't wait to record some rhythm tracks.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-06 16:57:27	@Palomafaith Why worry early when you can panic late, stress & tension lead to an early grave; if people put off panic lives would be saved
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-06 16:58:55	@Palomafaith So why worry early when you can panic late?' Lyric by me, c 1984
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-07 12:28:15	@Jigsawdog Had to make sure it was all in working order (Sneaked in a jagged rhythm track for Thumping Punch, don't tell Mrs BnT).
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-13 09:34:10	When I hear Wacko Jacko's latest I want to sing, sing, sing. But what I want to sing is 'No woman, no cry, no woman no cry'
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-13 11:46:35	Think I've finished trumpet on South East Corner, and got some good vocal tracks done.  May post online before Xmas!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-17 12:51:45	Groo! First mix of SEC and bass is too loud, and I'm a bassy. Not sure about trumpet sound either when heard on hi-fi. Drawing board?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-20 11:05:44	SEC on hold - had ideas for rhythm guitar that must wait for Xmas hand over of Tanglewood. Also want to re-do horn. Near, but still far...
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-22 08:56:10	72 hours until Xmas Tanglewood - oh, the rhythm that awaits! (still like bass n trumpet tho)
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-01-19 10:51:40	Teacher responds positively to recorded horn sound - on the right track! Will finish South East Corner horn in next week, then to mixing.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-24 16:57:31	Gave the horn its Xmas strip and clean. Sounds good. Happy Festivus to the rest of us. Not that there's anything wrong with that. [ 80)
107814526	bassntrumpet	2010-12-24 18:28:09	Radical move - recorded Mirrors without mute - horn may be better without. Think I may have laid down a decent version. Festivus is on!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-01-22 12:06:07	Yay! new pc arrives with notation software. big band arrangements ahoy.  More mundane, try to finish SEC horn part.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-01-25 10:00:10	This year I take to the stage again...big gig on horizon in autumn, start with open mic stuff soon? Must...do...some...research...
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-01-27 14:13:24	Poor session on horn yesterday. Fingers worked ok, but energy levels low and only feeble parps came out. Will I get much done tomorrow?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-01-26 12:08:24	Plan for Friday: Finalise vocals and trumpet on 2 Pins and South East Corner. Work on website. Problem - no energy. Recover in 36 hours!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-01-31 14:09:16	Mrs BnT found me looking at cornets on ebay. No more instruments in this house, she cried. If I catch you looking again, you're out!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-02-01 11:21:42	Mrs BnT at zumba tonight...means I can sneaky peek at cornets...errh, I mean get on with some recording. Or should I spy at flugelhorns?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-01-07 12:50:34	Oh, that lovely Tanglewood TSB59! Recorded rhythm track for South East Corner last night. Just got to nail a good sounding trumpet part.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-02-02 12:15:12	Did notice a nice cornet while Mrs BnT was out...may have to work on this a bit.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-02-10 15:40:02	Cornet v  flugelhorn - hard disc recorder v notation software? If only had time & money for all...
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-02-15 10:19:16	Scotland woeful in rugby at weekend - wish I'd been in Lanzarote and unable to watch. Missing it this year 80(
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-02-17 11:05:47	Loved @Palomafaith on Brits duetting with Ceelo. Her live version of Forget You was fabby when we saw her last year.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-02-18 11:02:57	Noooooo! RIP Uncle Leo. Classic character, one of many in Seinfeld. Must watch an episode this weekend, play the Last Post on my horn.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-02-21 10:04:28	Frustrating weekend - nailed last mute part for South East Corner but failed with last open horn part. Many takes but no result...
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-03-01 20:23:57	So what did Saint David ever do for Wales? Please enlighten me  Thanks. RIP Jane Russell.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-03-01 21:44:01	Trying to record my trumpet bit...it's changed, but I think I like it better this way.  Much more free. For 2 Pins I would....
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-03-30 08:21:11	Loving my new bucket mute, stuffed with cotton wool. Teach said that it made the trumpet sound like a sax. Look forward to recording it.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-03-06 18:38:51	Think I've got 3 songs finished...now to mix and post online.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-03-06 18:57:02	But then I listen again and wonder if I could do that bit better - time to let go, can always refine them later I guess.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-04-11 11:17:01	Spring, so DIY and gardening intefere with music making. Still, the garden gives so much back that it's worthwhile.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-03-07 13:01:06	If iPad 2 didn't exist, would it be necessary to invent it? How many will now dump their once-beloved iPad as junk and buy anew?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-02-22 09:13:18	Wait - may have found an earlier take that nails the elusive part. Check again with fresh ears tonight...
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-02-23 08:57:51	Umm, must have been some reason I thought I needed to do horn part again...will listen afresh yet again..
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-03-21 16:25:07	Back from hols..where was I? Changed techno brass to other instruments, maybe underpowered now? Started to mix Lets Not tho.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-03-22 11:57:46	Never too late for a good idea - almost finished 2 Pins, started long since, good BV line hit me in the car, rushed home and recorded it.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-03-08 15:52:57	Fresh ears tell me horn is out of tune in places on Mirrors Dont Lie...so a slight change to the riff, might even be an improvement.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-02-24 08:53:51	@mattshakespeare I disagree with you about @palomafaith.  Pray tell what you hold as a good example of British culture?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-02-24 11:11:48	Pleased with horn work last night - came up with a really nice trumpet finish for Let's Not Start Over. Poignant, I thought.

107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-03-10 21:22:26	Began mixing Am I In Love - not so sure about techno-brass part - maybe jars with sax, trumpet, bassoon and cor anglais. can soon mend tho.

107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-02-28 20:59:56	Came up with good horn part for 2 Pins, but can I play it? Didn't realise the song was so fast.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2011-04-26 08:39:28	Dug out a song I wrote in the 70s and able to decipher primitive notation I used. Makes a cracking bass line on electric upright today.

107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-07-27 18:13:32	@maxkeiser @tominterrupto How does that work?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-07-27 18:15:30	@mjselfridge @Herring1967 Or, you could have learned how to be with your child when you're with your child, and not playing a computer game.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-07-28 17:37:44	@tominterrupto Hmmmm, not sure Israel bases its foreign policy on how the BBC writes about it?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-07-29 20:33:36	@cjwerleman 'Filled'? Really?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-07-29 20:39:13	@ioanesrakhmat @RichardDawkins But does it though?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-08-03 17:35:15	@Herring1967 Hope you can sort out the jarring and laboured bits before I come to see it, but sounds promising.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-08-07 16:20:29	@BlondieOfficial H'mmm, now which of these bands was better?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-08-06 10:15:17	@JihadistJoe @RichardDawkins Can you eat it yourself?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-08-15 17:47:38	@CEMB_forum Isn't it still like a form of slavery though, even though it's 'good' slavery?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-08-16 18:20:57	@blogdignag @carl_nottingham @Jrg_Lima @RichardDawkins Wasn't Hitler a Catholic?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-08-19 20:42:24	Will Billy Connolly's hair ever realise it's not the 1970s?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-08-21 17:25:52	Good set by @LornaReidJAzz at the Jazz Bar earlier today, nice work also by Euan Stephenson and Graeme Stephen on piano and guitar.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-08-23 13:59:57	@CEMB_forum Y Barry's argument - 'they did it it as well'. But your guys did do it, right? 'But they did it as well'.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-08-26 17:10:31	@Bertiebobo @BBCJFCulture Surely Duran Duran were New Romantics?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-08-26 20:18:42	@TheTweetOfGod @CEMB_forum Did anyone ever discover what blastomy is?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-09-20 10:55:07	@stevyncolgan @PaulieCrocetti @ProfFrancesca @ST0NEHENGE nice work.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-10-03 11:00:42	@Baddiel @amateursuman or if they were considering a change, did you ever say 'better the Baddiel you know'?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-10-03 17:14:53	@RichardDawkins Could it be the brain that tells us which decision to make, and where is the guardian angel if I get hit by a bus?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-10-18 10:06:32	Christian Wallumrod @queenshall last night. Unpredictable minimalists, I just didn't know what they weren't going to do next.

107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-10-24 16:45:57	@audibleuk Please don't bring anything related to Russell Brand to my attention. Thanks.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-11-09 17:50:39	Fabulous gig by @SNJO2 on Friday, music of Jaco Pastorius, and looking forward to going back to @queens_hall tonight for Stacey Kent.

107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-11-20 18:42:01	Good night @queens_hall y'day, @GraemeStephenUK  and top notch jazzists accompanying Nosferatu, unsettling stuff. Max Schreck = max eerie.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-12-06 11:46:52	Should be some good theological debate on #Corrie now they have a gay vicar and a Muslim family. Which side would Emily Bishop take?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2014-12-25 14:32:31	@Stan_And_Ollie Just watched Twice Two and Big Business, fabulous Xmas merriment!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-01-07 20:09:32	@State_Control Yes, let's all carry guns, then nobody would ever use them...or they could shoot first I suppose.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-01-07 20:41:43	@xox_saleha Well, at 1.7 billion against 6 billion, maybe not all...
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-01-07 20:36:19	@FarhanKVirk 'And only if you don't hurt their feelings' do you mean? Because getting your feelings hurt is pretty bad.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-01-13 20:42:19	@sparklingtear @mehdirhasan And just because someone can be offended, doesn't mean they have to be. Nor do others have to care if they are.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-01-13 20:44:13	@CEMB_forum It sounds almost as if they are idolising the person they love more than their flesh and blood.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-01-26 18:12:57	'Church of England wouldn't have appointed a woman bishop in the days when it had real power, waits until it's almost irrelevant'. Discuss.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-01-30 22:29:46	Good to get Sibelius fired up after a break of a while and jot down some jazzy ideas. Think they'll be pretty, pretty good.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-01-30 22:37:58	Is it Paul Morley's mouth alone or the combination with the double chin that makes him look unsettling?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-01-31 19:00:20	@PaulNicholsDC @ThinkAtheist @CBJinDC Ummm, isn't it more about not being convinced without proof that something is there?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-02-01 12:42:45	@BenWeinthal @dennismons @RichardDawkins @Whoozley I think the cartoon is talking about nowadays.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-02-03 18:13:42	@RichardDawkins Rather than tell me what a thing was like ('He was all, like, scruffy'), tell me instead how it actually was.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-02-15 13:54:37	Be good when we eventually get to see the definitive list of what we can and can't talk about.  Hope it'll come out soon.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-02-17 21:55:23	Blimey, a lot of people get mixed up between 'allot', meaning to parcel out, and 'a lot', meaning quite a few. And they can't spell 'allot'.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-02-20 14:59:27	'No one knows better than parents how to bring up their children,' says top Scots Tory. Yes, it's so important to hire the right nanny.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-02-21 11:31:35	@SNJO2, 20th anniversary, are they going backwards? Early days, 2 females in the band, nowadays, none? Discuss.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-02-21 11:34:31	@ProfFrancesca Which verse do you find the plastic wrapper and the mechanised means of production in?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-02-22 15:57:14	@Max_Benwell @ProfFrancesca Well, as everything but path of righteousness leads to Satan I suppose he's right. it ain't Judeo-Christian, eh?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-02-22 18:11:37	Practising for Tues gig at Whistle Binkies...but not just practising trumpet and vox as usual...
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-02-28 18:01:12	@SuperTshim @JRehling so what if they can't reproduce?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-02-28 18:04:31	@simonthoumire @scottishmusic oh, a guessing game. Is it 'don't make a mess of your chance?' or maybe 'don't fumble your chance?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-03-05 17:44:10	@StickMan_v7 @RichardDawkins @Vernontap  but... which version of Islam?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-03-06 18:42:54	@JoJogirandi And the god thing is open to debate, so music = champion!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-03-11 21:10:07	Isn't there enough suffering in the world with FGM, genocide, beheadings, imperialism - but to deprive fans of Top Gear - oh,the humanity!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-03-13 16:13:24	'Dermot O'Leary never wants to dance again', know how he feels about being sick of something - I've never wanted to see him again for ages.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-03-21 12:39:41	top notch gig @queens_hall last night. Young'Uns and @TheUnthanks. Shivers down spine and tears in the eyes. My first folk gig - thanks!

107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-03-21 19:46:34	#sixnations in terms of six nations and in terms of annoying commentators, the guy on Italy Wales took the in terms of biscuit. No need!
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-03-21 19:48:37	@holland_tom And yet death by scrums and death by video ref replay are generally killing the game.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-03-25 20:43:09	Appalled at BBC's @PM programme only devoting the first 20 minutes to the 'tragedy' ( Copyright James May) of Top Gear? You are ridiculous.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-03-25 20:45:04	Oh for a world where the only tragedies are massacres and plane crashes, but Clarkson getting fired is just too much to take, says TG fan.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-03-25 20:48:09	Why do people assume because I signed one petition, I'm interested in every other petition under the sun?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-03-30 22:02:30	@sclyon15 @Frettlessrick How does the grace of god thing work? US hasn't been destroyed, therefore grace of god must be protecting it?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-04-15 19:47:25	Big w/end of gigs coming up - @LornaReidJazz Fri, @RSNO chamber group Sun pm, Black aka Colin Vearncombe Sun night. Which will be best?
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-04-18 11:43:22	Great night @queens_hall last night, thanks to @lornareidjazz for a top notch gig. She was in fine voice. Set the bar for my w/end of gigs.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-04-19 21:51:43	Great set by Colin Vearncombe and Calum McColl in Edinburgh tonight. Shame the city couldn't provide more punters.

107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-05-03 16:28:51	You can't expect facts about a religious leader's life to be accurate in the way regular facts are, but they do reveal a deeper accuracy.
107814526	bassntrumpet	2015-05-10 15:13:10	'sending prayers' to someone who's had a tragedy is so much smugger and self-righteous than just 'thinking about them', don't you find?
