108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-17 21:32:55	That awkward moment when your boyfriends ex girlfriend  is in the beach house right next to us
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-17 22:35:47	My favorite part of nags head is brew thrus, wings, and of course the ocean 😊
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-14 17:42:29	I finished my book and I forgot to being another one to work
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-14 17:44:00	Knowing that school starts when I get home from the beach

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-19 15:02:43	Clearly if you come to the beach with a strapless bathing suit .. You're not here to have fun
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-18 16:21:11	Dag nabbit I already broke the string off of my boogie board 😩
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-16 15:47:59	Logan said everyone knows me , like everywhere we go I see someone I know ... I'm not sure if he was saying it in a bad way or ..?
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-16 18:19:52	It's really weird how many people have asked if Madison and I were twins .. I don't think we look alike

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-16 20:22:53	When there's a ghost don't try to reason with it
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-16 20:23:17	You understand songs a lot more if you read books a lot

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-16 20:38:17	Actually I just wish my boyfriend texted me with some kind of interest
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-16 23:42:18	I've been at work since 10:30 and I have an hour and 20 minutes left 😭🔫
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-17 00:24:27	Like who is hunter Moore and why do girls call him father and WHY do they send him nakey pictures ?!
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-16 21:21:20	Splashy for life

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-17 14:40:52	It's easy to hate me , it harder to love me
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-17 15:32:43	@princesslacy90 meh I'm on the way to nags head right now 😔

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-23 13:23:29	Logan said "my last name is sweet, that's why you wanna marry me 😏"
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-08-23 13:30:50	@kyleighblucher ill send you a picture right after I get it 😊

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-09-05 11:24:23	Ya know life's so easy for people that go to university's rather than community college.
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-09-05 11:25:12	People in community colleges have to do the same stuff and work everyday but people at university's don't have to work

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-09-10 04:32:45	How could you constantly hurt the girl you "love" and "wanna marry" .. That just seems so wrong to me
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-09-10 04:58:47	Never thought I could hate someone that meant the world to me just yesterday
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-09-10 05:09:22	I can't sleep
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-09-10 05:09:40	I need someone new to text

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-09-10 12:18:16	Like a broken dream I was incomplete but your love was never the missing key
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-09-10 12:20:52	Without your love I'm getting somewhere
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-09-10 12:22:57	Seems like the people we love the most, we tend to hurt the most. It's so fucked up

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-10-09 13:07:10	I thought you would be there when I go: You promised you would be there when I go, but all the broken promises won't be missed
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-10-09 13:08:35	If you're trying to find pity then you need to look somewhere else because I surely can't help you

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-10-09 16:43:37	Everyone hates it when I wear heels at work because I look down on them
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-10-08 20:12:24	Madison just said I'm the sister that she never wanted .. 🆒😂
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2013-10-09 16:53:50	The perks of having little boobs, is that you can wear a sports bra in public and no one knows 😈

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-02-27 04:52:43	Either I fall asleep at like 7 at night or like 2 in the morning. It's never consistent and it is extremely annoying

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-03 08:24:28	I find it rather hilarious when people call their once significant other bad names. You loved every bit of that at one point

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-08 12:12:59	I just love spending my money on expensive makeup, because it's worth it. Drugstore makeup is full of chemicals that's are harmful.
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-07 03:10:38	You should not plan your life around your significant other. Do what YOU want to do.

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-14 22:45:07	I would rather be at home watching gossip girl
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-15 23:12:17	Like I can't stop watching gossip girl, it just gets better and better
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-14 23:38:10	I texted logan to save me a pink &amp; orange starburst, and he gave them to me before he even read my text 😹😹
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-17 05:12:01	This was stupid to even go out. I'm so bored
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-18 15:27:19	@loganm1313 you never complain about the outcome :)

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-17 14:58:43	My mom never takes me shopping anymore. I have to buy every freaking thing for myself.
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-17 20:44:32	Still smack a bitch if I am sober
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-17 05:23:21	I have a headache

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-17 06:30:30	In my bed
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-18 01:36:33	Someone get me out of this house 😩😩
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-18 02:10:35	I wish I was like Serena van der woodsen, she never runs out of friends to hang out with.
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-18 01:49:18	Super boring and crappy weekend
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-18 13:08:27	My cat has licked me so much this morning, like she won't stop licking my nose and lips

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-24 21:19:32	@barry_nodairy oh you guys can't do it solo?
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-24 22:00:12	@barry_nodairy who said that y'all were better ?
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-25 01:06:51	@barry_nodairy right that's very believable
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-25 01:13:31	@barry_nodairy okay? I mean I guess it's cool to go our of your way to bring people down..
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-25 01:16:14	@barry_nodairy but did they really say that ?
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-25 01:37:16	@barry_nodairy what kind of changes ?
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-05-25 01:38:57	@barry_nodairy oh well that wasn't something that I could change on my own. Fridays and Saturdays are so annoying to work

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-06-22 22:30:57	Every time I get wings, and take home my left overs my dad NEVER fails to eat them. It really upsets me!
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-06-22 22:33:12	I feel like I'm the only girl that doesn't pretend to like sports. Sports just do not interest me one bit.
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-06-22 23:04:18	Either I have lots of plans or none.

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-06-26 19:51:34	For real I'm just so tired of being ignored.
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-06-24 13:32:00	But babbby am I wrong for thinking we could be something for real? 😚
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-06-26 21:10:17	I'm probably the quickest texter backer .. Like ever
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-06-24 14:40:49	No new friends

108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-06-27 19:25:19	I try not to take pictures that make me look way better than I really am. That way when people see me in real life they are not disappointed
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-06-29 21:18:55	I want Chinese food
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-06-29 22:20:51	I need some plans. Tired of sitting in the house
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-06-27 12:29:09	Obviously you are just lashing out.
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-06-27 12:32:47	I'm desperate to move to Florida.
108355756	StephanieeGynac	2014-06-27 13:29:08	I love Serena and Blair's friendship, and I love Chuck and Blair's relationship.
