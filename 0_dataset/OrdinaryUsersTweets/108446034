108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-06 15:21:30	Today Isn't My Day!!!!
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-06 15:21:38	I need a Friend.
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-06 15:22:00	Butttt. Friends turn to bustas!
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-06 15:22:10	My Circle SMALL.
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-07 20:46:38	Don't expect everybody to understand your journey especially if they've never had to walk in your path.
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-07 20:46:59	I Kill them with success and bury them with a smile.
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-07 20:47:24	Never explain yourself. Your friends dont need it and your enemies won’t believe it.
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-07 20:47:56	I don't open up to just anybody .. AT ALL. So if I open up to you don't ever lose my trust. Cuz once its gone, it's gone forever.
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-07 20:48:18	We've all been the fool, we've all made mistakes and we've all been hurt, but learning from those experiences can make you a better person..
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-07 20:48:59	Once you lose my respect, it's no reason for me to talk to you anymore on any type of level.
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-07 20:49:12	Forgiving someone is easy, but being able to trust them again is a totally different story.
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-07 20:49:35	I believe God definitely puts people in your life for a reason real talk!
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-07 20:50:01	Don't never down nobody for the situation they're in, cuz just like they got in it you can too... God don't have no favorites! #Truee...
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-07 20:50:40	I absolutely HATE it when I'm being lied straight to my face when I KNOW every bit of the truth.
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-07 20:51:06	When you don't know what to say but you really want to talk to someone. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-07 20:52:15	Some people aren't meant to be in our lives forever. Some are just passing through to teach us a lesson.
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-07 20:52:16	If we together, nobody else matters
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-07 20:52:44	I hate it when people bring up things from the past just to hurt you. It will hurt YOU if you don't let that shit go.
108446034	Breezy_Str8Weed	2013-04-07 20:53:43	Dont Dream It ... Be It!
