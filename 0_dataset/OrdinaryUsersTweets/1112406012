1112406012	AmiDhyani	2015-03-09 23:42:04	@gsmak1 I don't understand your point. Mine is that issues shouldn't be covered up. If you don't want to watch it, don't. your choice.
1112406012	AmiDhyani	2015-03-09 23:44:29	@gsmak1 How is banning going to do any good? If you want to stay in a hole and not be aware of the issues around you, don't watch it.
1112406012	AmiDhyani	2015-03-10 02:26:27	@sanghajatt84 what's your point?The ban on #IndiasDaughter is stopping every1 from watching it! No one is forced to watch it.
1112406012	AmiDhyani	2015-03-10 02:29:03	@sanghajatt84 @trisdhaliwal How is banning going to do any good? You can choose to stay in a hole and not be aware of the issues around you

1112406012	AmiDhyani	2015-03-10 02:56:32	@sanghajatt84 @trisdhaliwal rightttt because as females, the only thing we are expected to aspire to is marriage. LOL. good one.
