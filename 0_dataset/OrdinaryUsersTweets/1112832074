1112832074	1_Life_1_shot	2013-06-03 06:02:43	@J_Ram_3 hopefully that humbles him
1112832074	1_Life_1_shot	2013-06-03 07:47:00	@J_Ram_3 lol yeah I had to shut him up real quick. To be honest he only looked good because its open gym with a lot of ransoms.
1112832074	1_Life_1_shot	2013-06-03 07:47:53	@J_Ram_3 lol put him in a college open gym or a legit open gym like Tice valley on Fridays and its a whole different story
