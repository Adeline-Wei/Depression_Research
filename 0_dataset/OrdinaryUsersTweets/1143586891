1143586891	Stayawake07	2014-01-28 02:31:44	@Nikki_Ferrell Hope you know you just made thousands of people hate you tonight. Good job. You and your bitchy whining.
1143586891	Stayawake07	2014-07-02 04:29:58	Cause I cant make you love me, if you dont. You cant make your heart feel something it wont. I will lay down my heart.

1143586891	Stayawake07	2015-06-18 01:58:45	society really sucks 
coming to terms made all these society comments hurt a hell of a lot more.
1143586891	Stayawake07	2015-06-18 23:38:29	realizing that some of the closest people to you will never really accept who you are as a person is heartbreaking
1143586891	Stayawake07	2015-06-18 23:39:13	People wonder why i can be so harsh about things but you have to always put yourself in another shoes before you cast judgments
1143586891	Stayawake07	2015-06-18 23:39:22	Even im still working on that
1143586891	Stayawake07	2015-06-18 23:40:03	but when you say even if you put yourself in another shoes and you would still hate them because of their "choices"? it hurts..and ots cruel
1143586891	Stayawake07	2015-06-18 23:40:33	so much for "love thy neighbor " huh.
1143586891	Stayawake07	2015-06-18 01:16:03	i really hate being here....i miss school and i miss my friends
