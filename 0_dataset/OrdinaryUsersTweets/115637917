115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2013-06-15 11:31:41	@hunter_troll if he wants to go let him. Put in request, stumped up the cash but on our terms. Simple. The whole thing is getting dull now.
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2013-06-15 15:18:00	@LBCeleste well said!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2013-06-15 15:54:48	@jagdesh should have a read of @LBCeleste time line. Some fair points there.
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2013-06-15 16:13:47	@jagdesh think he has just had enough.  Who could blame him? I would be upset if he did but I certainly wouldn't blame him.
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2013-06-15 16:20:46	@jagdesh I would have said 1 more season but he's fed up so probably won't be here next.

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2013-07-09 22:47:09	@LBCeleste he is going about it. Hand in transfer request, pay the asking price and then he can go. But has to be on LFC terms.
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2013-07-09 22:56:07	@OneJoelFifty @LBCeleste if he went to any team in EPL would how him as a poor character, after all he has said. Would just be lies tbh.

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-03 22:22:41	@MisguidedMinx guess "What a pussy, he needs to man up" doesn't quite mean the same :)
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-04 08:05:01	@Geetanjili wow, commitment. I am struggling this am to get there but will 🚲
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-05 21:10:43	Still cannot believe that has happened...
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-05 21:17:07	@Tina1807 not happy at all. Let see what happens now but we shouldn't have had to rely on others.
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-05 21:20:06	@NaveedAhmad786 yes true. We have been bad at defending all season. Far too many get out of jail cards this year
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-05 21:21:17	@Tina1807 I hated that day too. Got top 4 which was our aim. Not sure what to think now

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-04 04:23:37	@harikriss when we were banging in goals for fun yes. There is tension now and it shows!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-04 04:27:57	@harikriss I hope they do. Think partly due Henderson not being about. Just need 3 hatricks on Monday ;)
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-04 20:33:23	@Tina1807 enjoy!

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-06 20:18:48	@RaksMistry good stuff. As long as it means something to you then worth while!! Stick a piccy up when it is done!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-06 20:19:34	@RaksMistry @KoshaV @dianqamajaya Was just about to say the same thing!!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-06 20:20:57	@KoshaV @KhandBapa I'm in London possibly the week after and want to go Regency for some chops!!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-06 20:22:58	@dianqamajaya @RaksMistry @KoshaV Either way make sure he tattoo's the right date. He is a bit dozy! lol
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-06 20:25:44	@RaksMistry Nah, joking. He is ok. He did mine and it was fine. You will be alright!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-06 20:29:26	@RaksMistry He is good when it comes tattoo's. It will be ok!

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-06 16:59:26	@Tina1807 ha, was a genuine question! Doesn't it fall into your food!? Lol

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-09 08:03:33	@Jiggy_P some would say far too long!

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-08 21:49:07	@RyanMcTrippy reckon he will struggle for a while straight after WC. Most players will.
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2014-05-07 19:26:24	@Sara_Nurrr it's like they are teasing all the LFC fans too!

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-08 08:26:10	@Anjuladevi yes, there's a market there!! Then again they would use cheap ingredients and not taste &amp; look so good!!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-08 08:31:22	@Anjuladevi go for it. A good trusted person who knows what food is about 😊
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-08 08:49:15	@Anjuladevi I agree with you there. Think more about education as the resources for good ingredients are there 😃
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-08 08:52:48	@thenitinsawhney tickets came in today!! YES!!!

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-08 18:33:44	@Anjuladevi haha, that's my mission!! I'm sure I will try that recipe sometime. All I do now is collect recipes, need to action them!

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-18 19:10:52	@Anjuladevi does it taste as good?
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-18 19:26:11	@Anjuladevi haha, texture of a muffin. Think I may try out as love them but avoiding fried food. So miss miss chips 😒
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-18 19:26:49	@payalpuri now that is very rare!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-18 19:28:56	@payalpuri cherish it!!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-18 19:30:02	@Anjuladevi Ah ok. Will try the spray out. I just can't get used to coconut oil though. Sorry I'm just so fussy! Lol
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-18 21:12:50	Give us £40m + and take him. Just worried BR will fucking spend the money on shit! #Sterling #LFC
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-18 21:14:38	If we don get that, keep him in low wages. He will soon change his tune! #Sterling #LFC
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-18 21:51:12	@Sabah07 and after last seasons spending spree we're f**ked!

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-19 19:35:52	Flipping hell. Just discovered Periscope #Slow
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-20 09:12:27	@Anjuladevi I asked the guy in Asda for spray oil and he bought me WD40. Hmmm, not quite! Lol

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-21 09:03:03	A lot of ego and shallowness flowing today... #Swerve
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-21 09:57:40	@SarbV1979 haha. We are so up shit creek at the moment. Changes needed!

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-21 21:24:37	@DJNoreenKhan @AnfieldIndex @Jassisidhu @_Gags_ @Harinder1977 wow. Looking forward to this one! 👍

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-22 06:56:53	@BinaSitaram all the best for the #Shakti launch tonight 👍
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-23 16:24:46	@natha25K try brown rice. It is lovely!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-23 16:27:36	@natha25K haha. Same here. Takes time to get used to making it but is much nicer and healthier :) 💪
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-23 16:46:10	@natha25K really? I thought it was. Will check it out!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-23 16:51:48	@natha25K brown bread is better than white. All wholewheat is. Justo moderation!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-23 17:51:55	@natha25K ah, I will do some more research on it then :)

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-24 08:37:12	@SarbV1979 haha. Don't hold back will you!!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-24 08:38:06	@Geetanjili more like a banana! 😝🍌
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-24 08:43:43	@SarbV1979 shoot them all down! The only ones I think came out this season were Couthino, Ibe, Mig and Can. Rest disappointing!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-24 08:50:36	@Geetanjili looks good though. Hope it was a great night and you all behaved!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-24 09:02:26	@SarbV1979 one or two of the others I give the benefit of doubt as I think manager screwed then over! Lol
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-24 09:16:59	@Geetanjili ha, and butter wouldn't melt in your mouth! Lol

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-29 22:18:47	@emptyMINDZ I reckon they have agreed a deal for sterling already. Just not announced. End up paying more than we should. Oh wait, we do!

115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-31 19:25:20	@dmullhi no worries. Great work you are doing 😊
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-31 19:50:45	@SarbV1979 was quite cynical with Ur views a while back but have to agree on FSG. They are clueless and not decisive enough.
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-31 19:55:07	@dhritiudeshi did u have a good trip in UK?
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-31 19:57:46	@dhritiudeshi good stuff. It's brill here. Bad weather in Mumbai? Not been there in years. Need to come and see my brother DJing there!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-31 19:59:35	@SarbV1979 exactly the same. They make a tidy profit and I reckon looking to sell. Got us for peanuts initially!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-31 20:03:17	@dhritiudeshi ouch, we rarely get that here. I heard roads were melting. Stay safe!
115637917	Jit_Chauhan	2015-05-31 20:07:22	@arshiariaz @dmullhi thank you 👌
