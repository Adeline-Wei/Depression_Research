115969905	The_Perish_Song	2010-06-17 02:35:21	Mr. T once had so many fools to pity that he didn't know what to do with them all...
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2010-06-17 02:35:44	...So he created Chuck Norris, from one of his ribs and a pound of gold, to roundhouse kick the surplus of fools in the face.
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2010-06-24 22:17:42	I need a vacation from myself.

115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-04-07 01:47:06	@legroschat I don't have a boyfriend, so I use that as an excuse to buy myself things sometimes- like a kindle for Valentines Day hahahaha
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-04-11 14:34:50	Amazon and Goodreads, stop recommending books to me! You don't understand my OCD- I will have to READ THEM ALL. X____X #Notenoughtime
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-04-12 20:44:43	I want to adopt the rats that live outside. They keep me company when I write. Their names are Ferdinand and Priscilla. They have 2 babies.
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-05-07 20:02:36	I tried on a 4-year-old's shoes today. They very nearly fit. He found it hilarious.

Why? Because cats are awesome. Obviously.
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-05-08 22:20:39	I am working with a little guy who calls me 'Big Sarah'. I am 4'9" and have NEVER been Big Sarah before. This is special.
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-05-19 17:08:53	Not to be morbid, but when I die, I want Faure's Requiem to be played at my funeral. Someone make a mental note of that! #GabrielFaure
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-05-21 15:41:34	Working voluntarily on a statutory holiday. But there's no one else in the office, and the building is pretty quiet, so it's all good!
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-05-14 19:19:27	4-year-old told me I "look lovely today". Pretty sure he didn't know what he was saying. But still. â™¥
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-05-24 15:54:45	You know you have good friends when a question like "WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT MY BOOBS" doesn't faze them...

115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-05-24 21:51:57	I think I need an Etsy jar. Like, every time I go on Etsy, I have to drop a dollar into it, that I'll never get back.
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-05-25 14:09:36	My room looks like a bookstore that overdosed on plushies and shat everywhere. #Truestorybro
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-05-22 01:10:59	Getting messages on my DA account. People favoriting my artwork from a bajillion years ago... Why are people still looking at that crap! D:
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-05-23 23:09:26	I think I've come to the conclusion that stupid people are essentially the root of 90% of my problems. #RAGE
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-05-23 23:09:47	The other 10% consists of shoes that don't fit and my kindle freezing on me. #RAGE
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-05-28 00:14:26	@Hitnwey You know it
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-05-30 19:52:30	My cat stares at me until I feed it. It's creeping me out. It knows it.
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-06-01 18:55:11	So, after months of investigation, the cause of my headaches are: they happen JUST BECAUSE MY BODY LOVES ME THAT MUCH.
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-06-01 18:55:40	And I'm immune to analgesics. #timetojumpoffacliff #ortryacupuncture
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-06-03 21:15:09	Burned my grilled cheese sandwich. Now my cat wants to eat it. #firstworldpains
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-06-22 13:40:07	Words... 'Infinitesimal' doesn't sound right in my head or saying it out loud and 'screen' no longer sounds or looks like a real word to me.
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-06-22 13:40:32	Screen screen screen screen screen IT DOESN'T LOOK REAL ANYMORE
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-06-21 02:21:16	Everybody needs to see this.

115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-06-27 15:21:37	And in other news, http://t.co/3CQxK3gV thinks I need to by 5 boxes of Shake N' Bake. #isconfused
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-06-27 20:47:07	@LaurenDeStefano is giving away an ARC of Sever! :D Good things CAN happen! http://t.co/SomUsUnY
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-06-27 22:54:26	So I opened the cupboard to get something and the cat was all 'cool i am going in' and made a beeline for the pasta.
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-06-27 22:55:02	I don't think he knew 'why' he wanted to go in or what he was looking for. Cupboard just = food for cats.
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-06-21 21:35:41	Suddenly, I want Christmas. I don't think it has to do with the heat.
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-06-21 21:36:23	@ArraFrost Me too. Pet peeve.
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-06-23 14:39:01	It's raining and I'm bored. Someone come play with me! D:
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-07-04 20:51:21	I am bored. I am so bored that I am talking to the rats in my backyard, and I don't think they understand me.
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-07-06 00:50:36	What would you do if the person you love was trapped under ice? Read Decker\'s story only on the #FRACTURE page http://t.co/490TSzM1
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-07-08 20:15:54	Today... I brushed my cat. He is still shedding. Fruitless endeavor. #accomplishednothingtoday
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2012-07-11 19:20:56	Finished folding clean laundry. Went to put it away- in the microwave.

115969905	The_Perish_Song	2013-03-28 20:32:24	Why do people say they will have their cell phones with the intent to communicate, but never turn them on? #firstworldproblems
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2013-03-24 23:38:42	The last time I said something on here was last July. I wonder if people think I periodically die and then get resurrected.
115969905	The_Perish_Song	2013-03-25 13:03:25	Though I'm turning 25 in a month, when people tell me I'm a grown-up, I still don't believe them.
