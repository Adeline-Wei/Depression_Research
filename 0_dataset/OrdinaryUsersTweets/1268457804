1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 00:53:41	I hate Herc.
Until August 7th, you're nothing to me.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 03:55:06	But the @UNT_ASO ain't bout that team follow back.
Your bio says you're diverse. 😔
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 03:56:34	You best believe imma be there.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 05:41:11	Listen to Good Kid, mAAd City.
Stop talkin crap about Kendrick.
Listen from beginning to end and you will think of music different.
Round 4
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 05:46:01	People lookin at me funny when I boost Kendrick, but y'all haven't even have GKMC a chance.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 05:46:38	And @dillionaire1994 you found him first, but I'm caught up on Kendrick. Lol
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 05:48:24	If people could use Beatles songs for hip hop samples... Words can't describe how great that would be... 😌
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 05:51:45	"... But I'm with the homies right now..."
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 06:08:10	@SpaldingBalling 
DJ Dahi said the best GKMC verse came from an alternate version of Money Trees and it was from Jay Rock. 
😐
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 06:19:27	Jay Rock,
I'll pray for you.
You're awful at what you do.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 06:55:45	Thirst Tweets. 
Y'all needa quit all this shenanigans.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 07:04:27	Though she got the world, she need me.

Can't stop listening to this song... 😬
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 07:09:17	Oops
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 07:09:26	@erikdane52: She Needs Me - Kendrick Lamar
Don't listen to the remix, but check out the original.

First verse describes it all.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 07:09:54	Man, I'm messin up my tweets today lol
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 07:11:33	Bruh.
Follow backs are always crucial.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 07:14:07	Still listen to that Control verse.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 07:17:12	I don't text anyone ever.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 07:22:44	People always tough on twitter.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 07:24:20	Still salty bout Koby stealin my twitter name and ruining my nicknames reputation.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 07:25:42	Dude wouldn't even respond when I called him out so ol' dude gotta jus face the consequences.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 07:29:04	Took my headphones off for the first time in 3 hours and my ears are in some serious pain.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 07:30:08	If the people who are still awake DM me an emoji, imma do somethin with it. Still haven't decided. Lol
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 15:53:12	@SpaldingBalling He was the one who mixed Money Trees
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 16:35:56	Xbox One is pretty amazing.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 19:56:48	I'm on a food vacation.
I'm jus gonna eat what my grandma makes. Ain't worried bout nothin'.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 20:05:23	Gotta thank the Akinlawon bros for inspiring me to dress better. 👌@SoIncredibul @PeterDoesntHaveATwitter
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-15 20:06:11	The weather has thrown me off. I thought it was 9:00, FR.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-16 03:53:01	Be straight up -&gt; Avoid Drama
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-16 03:55:09	I'm tired of trying to be nice to everyone, but at the same time I think about the repercussions of being rude and just be nice. Lol
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 02:59:11	I wanted Russell Westbrook to say "You're the Real MVP..."
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 04:01:55	@SpaldingBalling The shorts you gave me might've had their last day.. The crotch has bottomed out. It was only a matter of time. 😭😭😭
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 04:02:43	Bruh, they were my favorite shorts... I wore them twice a week plus I had two pairs so like 4 times a week.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 04:03:02	@SpaldingBalling You did, but I wore them like 4x a week
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 04:03:48	Dang, man.
Gotta buy me a new pair, bright and early.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 04:04:03	Makes me mad though.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 04:05:04	The hole makes it to where I can be more flexible though.
It's like a hidden gusset.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 04:08:22	@SpaldingBalling It's my crotch. Not my armpits....
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 01:23:06	Drake is trash @ESPYS
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 02:03:48	Drake put that horse on blast.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 03:06:09	If I met you this year and we are Facebook friends, then it's real.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 03:56:18	Just found out I had a massive hole in my pants.. 😭
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 04:10:32	Why did Herc just send my this picture?
I know why?
But, why? http://t.co/ClHo5dDmYX
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 04:13:15	Taxi 12's are the nicest shoes in the world.
Never gonna own a pair, but they are something else....
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 04:14:46	I feel like I can't take a decent picture of myself w/o going full D-bag.
Sorry people. I'm a nice person, really.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-18 01:48:54	A girl at work genuinely thinks Kirko is better than Kendrick! She asked her friends who was better, 100% said K Dot.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-18 02:52:15	@CharmDarling Haha, nice!
Where were you gonna live if one didn't open up?
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-17 15:23:15	@SpaldingBalling The only ones they got are trash...
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-18 03:04:29	@CharmDarling did you get a private or do ya have a roommate?
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-18 03:07:00	@CharmDarling that's what I'm doin too.
Do you know her? Lol
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-18 03:14:14	@CharmDarling Ya, you have a good sized room, plus a shared area. 

Its convenient if ya like your roommate like I do! 😘-&gt;@SpaldingBalling
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-18 03:27:01	@SpaldingBalling I told you that I wanted the room furthest from the bathroom, so we 💯💯💯
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-18 03:33:53	@CharmDarling Yeah, it's got a kitchen but I'm probably not gonna use it more than 3 or 4 times all year lol
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-18 03:38:14	@CharmDarling I hope so!
I'm really excited to move in.
Been counting down the days!
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-18 03:38:47	@CharmDarling I don't think it could beT Trads though.
That's where I met my crew!
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-18 03:53:20	@CharmDarling 
Yeah I'm gonna miss it too.
Hopefully it will be as fun as Trads.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-18 04:12:30	Dude going out with a BANG! 😂
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-18 04:47:50	Bruh is pronounced Br-eau-eh for me.

You feel that dudes pain in that song, FR.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-18 05:37:40	That video of Conan and Dave Franco is classic! Hahaha
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-19 04:22:43	Too much pie IS a bad thing.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-20 04:55:54	That's a must.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-19 13:25:13	@Raymond_Mikell remind me!
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-20 22:00:49	Not even for $50 an hour.. Lol

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-21 04:37:50	@mr__mowgli I can dig it.
Sounds like Ab-Soul, but with better beats lol
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-20 18:55:34	You better get some security.. Remember what happened last time you were in High School? http://t.co/Lxd7uc5GDI
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-21 04:52:18	So basically every Biggie song is based off his ghetto alter ego.

His mom says you can't find close to any truth in his lyrics.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-21 04:54:39	I used to jam to Diamonds by Rihanna.
😂😂😂
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-21 04:57:56	I used to jam to Rihanna in general.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-20 20:20:00	Might make a visit up to Den10 this Friday for my cousins Junior Day

Makes a lot of sense.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-21 04:28:15	@soccerponce4 @Raymond_Mikell @SpaldingBalling No one plays with me and I only got one dude who actually plays but I haven't yet...
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-21 05:30:17	Some nights instead of just prayin I jus talk to God in like a conversation type of way.
I always crack jokes, but he's heard em all, sooo.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-21 05:30:49	Never got a laugh, but apparently I'm not funny anymore.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-21 13:28:13	Haven't been to Denton for nearly 3 months..
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-21 05:33:12	But FR, if you have trouble praying, just start talking about random stuff. You can say anything bc he already knows. Lol
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-18 20:44:06	Added this dude on Facebook from Atlanta GA like 4 years ago on accident and now he's a self proclaimed "Street Murderer".

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-19 00:00:46	@Raymond_Mikell I totally forgot the context lol
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-21 20:11:24	@Sweatersbang Oh dang! Joining that Mean Green Nation I see.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-22 00:31:56	Tony Dungy got my support though.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-22 01:57:19	My parents belittle me by making fun of my biceps..
They're pretty massive knowing I haven't consistently worked them for a while.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-22 01:58:32	Should I work out early or late? 
Hmmm...?
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-22 03:12:21	Idc what my parents say. Lol
I still got it 💪
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-22 03:27:34	Denton on Friday!

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 15:26:08	Mean Green on the come up.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-22 16:07:00	@presto_mitch @inaworldofmy0wn Trads was family thoZ
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 04:35:13	Just had a thought that might've set things straight.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 04:35:40	Kinda makes me feel like I know what I was born for.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 04:36:07	Gonna keep that thought to myself for awhile, because I need to think on it.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 04:37:08	I got a spiritual gift that I don't even use and I've known about it for a long time..
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 04:40:59	I'm excited rn.
I might have to give up on one dream, but if I keep getting the same answer in prayer, I can't ignore it.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 04:43:20	I always told people "if I was born 20 years ago..."

But I can still do something NOW.

Gods got me watchin my own show.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 04:45:23	Gotta start hittin The Word.
I've been slacking for awhile..

My mom and dad have always read it, but... (Cont.)
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 04:46:27	(Cont.) my brother has showed me that I'm not too young to start.

I been waiting on God. Askin him to push me..
I gotta push myself though.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 04:52:42	I didn't have false idols.. God was just preparing me.

Now I got to get some Fam to keep me accountable.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 05:10:07	From now on, I'm gonna share with my followers something I learn for the bible everyday and if I don't, call me out. That's a bet.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 05:41:40	I need God, not the other way around.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 05:42:43	He's been begging me to live a life filled with his spirit, but I been putting GOD on hold. 
Maybe you have, too.
Let's change that.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 06:45:33	Been tryna figure out life, but I been deciding stuff without askin God if I'm doin' it right.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-22 03:18:19	The bad thing about working out at night is that I get a ridiculous burst of energy.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-22 03:21:42	I'm glad I have naturally strong legs bc otherwise I would be that guy with the little bitty legs and big upper body.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-22 03:31:23	I talk 100000x different now compared to this time last year.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-22 04:36:23	Grosses me out when ladies cuss lol
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-22 19:06:28	Good to know that @KavnerDC is a Kendrick/Cowboy fan, too.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 16:52:11	Tupac: Resurrection was the best movie I have ever watched, hands down.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-22 18:12:09	@shackattack1997 Nice Pic.
😂😂😂😂
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-22 18:15:45	We had such a good team in 2012.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 04:48:27	(Cont.) I always looked at success as a financial/well-being thing, but you don't need funds to be successful.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 04:51:16	(Cont.) God says in Proverbs 28:6

Better to be poor and honest than rich and dishonest.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 05:37:41	Connected to God rn and I heard something I didn't wanna hear. 

Gotta change something that won't be easy.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-24 05:01:48	It might sound like kinda cocky, but there's nothing better than lookin in the mirror when you're workin out.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-24 05:03:55	I love working out in sound canceling headphones, too.
Bc I can block everyone out and focus on the weights.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-24 05:33:20	Why do I always give up on the bible.
Seriously speaks to you directly...
I'm getting answers that I thought were for me to figure out.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-23 04:59:54	Been sleepin on God like I'm too young to be a follower.
I was a believer, but I never did the things to use my gifts and resources.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-25 04:58:18	Gotta change this tire + drive two hours...
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-25 04:59:14	@CharmDarling Haha, yeah!
I like curly haired women, so when I saw that I had to join! 😂
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-25 05:00:57	@CharmDarling They have some clubs that could probably ruin UNTs reputation if it became public. Lol
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-25 05:02:20	Wow. People who stay tweeting bout God and then flip to the complete opposite side of the spectrum make me mad.. You're reppin Jesus, cuh.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-25 05:03:25	@CharmDarling You should just join the lobby club lol
It was dope @ traditions!
Met my whole Fam there!

I love you, Kyle.

Lol, I love everyone who loves KDot or Pac.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-25 05:05:32	@CharmDarling Nah, not like a legit club, but at Trads we would jus all meet there when we were bored.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-25 05:06:00	HiiiPower Nation
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-25 05:07:54	@Forever_KB @2livee4youu He's gonna hit you with someone weak like Chance or Drake lol
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-25 05:08:55	@Forever_KB especially if you already listen to GKMC and know the whole story.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-25 05:09:47	@Forever_KB Not KDot tho.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-25 05:10:16	@2livee4youu @Forever_KB maybe at freestylin.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-25 05:10:50	@2livee4youu @Forever_KB ... That's the biggest lie ever

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-27 19:34:56	Listen to The Heart Pt. 3 by Kendrick and you'll know it's King Kendrick and not King Los. @2livee4youu @Forever_KB
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-25 08:37:54	Gotta thank muh dude, Jesus, for letting me make this safe trip.
I kinda asked for that whole tire predicament, but I'm jus glad I'm here
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-25 08:41:12	I had a nice long conversational prayer on the way here.

Then I pushed out the last leg with a Tupac/Kendrick jam session.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-25 08:54:51	I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
Than die and find out there really is..

Think about it.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-28 06:36:35	So this girl at work keeps spanking me, and it ain't cool.
In front of customers and everything.

She ain't Fam or nothin, so step back.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-28 06:39:51	I remember I asked this girl out on the last day of school in 3rd grade and she moved before 4th grade started.. So we still dating or..? 😐❓
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-28 06:41:55	I dunno her last name, but it's been a solid 10 years or so..
We've never had a fight or anything.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-28 06:46:41	Honestly don't even remember her first name.. Nicole or Vicky or Nicky.. Idk.
She always played Oregon Trail w me so she was cool.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-28 06:47:56	I was always gettin killed in Oregon Trail by rattle snakes.. My family would have to survive by the memories I left them.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-28 06:49:29	You'd think I'd learn to stay in the wagon, but them snakes are sneaky and I like to imagine they jus bite me in the as chillies and 😵
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-28 13:47:39	I get so hyped listening to California Love.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-30 07:37:04	Rayshun will always be 1 of my best friends bc he can talk about anything. We jus sat outside the theater &amp; talked about our faith for 2hrs.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-30 07:37:57	Hyped off Jesus, FR though. 

Hopefully he can help me get some rest for work tomorrow.. 😬

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-31 05:37:43	2 weeks of reading and analyzing the bible.
Need to start putting in some action.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-31 05:39:31	Every time I finish my nightly reading, I always just want to keep going.
I guess reading my bible is an OK addiction. 😌
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-31 05:44:23	Kendrick and Pac really inspired me to look deeper in my faith. I attribute a lot of what I've learned to them.
Strange influences, huh?
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-01 00:25:05	Biggie reminds me of Biz Markie.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-29 04:28:11	Y'all talk about how no matter what you do your relationships won't last. Well maybe you should put some Jesus in that relationship.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-29 04:29:12	I want a relationship where it's based around my faith.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-29 04:29:43	Instead of just having someone around and to spend time with. I want to grow with someone. That's what it all about anyways.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-29 04:31:18	Never had that before, but I guarantee my next relationship will include a Bible and devotions.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-29 04:32:28	I'm addicted to hip hop and the Dallas Cowboys, but they're in the background of God bc I talk to him constantly.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-29 04:34:33	I also have learned that I have the power to influence people and I haven't been using it according to Gods plan.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-29 04:36:40	I'm about to clean up my twitter some of y'all are jus bad influences. I'm sorry, lol

Y'all's parents would beat y'all if they saw half the stuff y'all posted.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-29 04:49:45	I accepted Christ a long time ago, but this is the first time I started following Christ.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-29 04:53:22	The great thing about the bible is it's too deep to "Finish" it.. You just have to alter your point of view
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-07-29 04:56:14	God Got Me

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 06:08:38	Let's Be Cops was dooooope
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 19:56:44	@D_Odom24 Idk, I'm sure they got a reason.
I dunno what it is, but it's not just senseless police brutality or anything.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 20:04:07	@D_Odom24 There are answers like the fact that the police report says Mike Brown tried to grab the cops gun
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 20:07:57	@D_Odom24 That's the problem. No one knows.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 20:14:13	@D_Odom24 People are making this cop out to be some phony, racist, cold blooded killer and won't accept his side of the story tho.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 20:16:45	@D_Odom24 what do you mean?
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 20:21:58	@D_Odom24 If you saw your friend get shot, you'd mend it in your head to make him seem like he wasn't in the wrong.
Im jus giving my opinion
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 20:26:23	@D_Odom24 Well you and me weren't there, so we don't know the whole story.
All you can do is support his family and let God serve justice.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 16:59:30	Police don't just shoot people for no reason.
I swear y'all are ridiculous.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 17:04:40	You didn't seriously say they should start killing the police, did you?

That won't solve any of your problems.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 17:05:47	Honestly can't tell bc you're illiterate.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 17:08:21	@Josautuirre The kid tried to grab the cops gun. That's a green light..
Maybe not shoot him 7 times but that's threatening the cops life.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 17:09:27	People be acting like cops are robots.
They gotta go home to their families, too.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 19:27:56	@D_Odom24 There's more people than police though, so if the crowds got out of hand, the polices job is still protect the rest of the town
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 19:33:35	@D_Odom24 It takes one person to do something to cause havoc.
They have rubber bullets, they're not about to kill a whole crowd.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-08-14 19:41:28	@D_Odom24 I'm just saying, they have to take precautions.
Look up "mob mentality"
People do stupid things in crowds bc they feel safe.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-09-23 16:02:45	People are hatin' on Kendrick because they never understood what GKMC was about. He's talked about his faith since before Section 80.

Wow.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-09-25 16:43:39	@marshallmann11 @nfl They took it out of context. He was saying all of the CBs on the roster practice hard and all deserve to start
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-09-25 16:44:15	@marshallmann11 @nfl But then he said some of us are better than others and i know this is better for the team.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-09-25 16:45:30	@marshallmann11 I watched the interview and he was being very team oriented.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-10-07 03:44:09	@Mr4thAndLong Redskins get more pressure bc their LBs can rush pretty good.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-10-07 03:46:45	@marshallmann11 True, but Seattle has had good traveling fans this year.. Tonight's game was like a typical NFL home game for them.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-10-07 03:50:49	@marshallmann11 Noted that Seattle isnt a typical home game.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-10-28 17:09:51	@Chappy_LS That FG was all DeMarco..
I'm just saying that as a player, Romo had to go back in for his teammates.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-10-28 17:13:22	@Chappy_LS Romo has been more injured and overcome much bigger deficits.
It wasn't based on the 'hot hand'. I think it was based of history.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-10-28 17:13:43	@Chappy_LS But I agree.
Weeden might've been the best choice
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-10-28 17:15:00	@Chappy_LS agreed.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-11-27 04:17:31	I've already decided imma be mad if Kendrick doesn't win album of the year and I haven't even heard it yet.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-11-27 04:22:48	@theajbray This is all I think about when I hear that song now.. https://t.co/G6EG6pzGSG

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-11-27 04:27:35	Honestly would be content if Kendrick ended his career with GKMC..
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-11-27 04:38:23	Who has better imagery than Kendrick?
(Serious question though.)
1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-11-27 00:28:05	Positive thinking can go a long way.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-12-03 19:08:52	Its worth the watch.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-12-27 05:17:25	Instead of looking at things as mistakes, maybe you should look at them as blessings. 
God doesn't mess up.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2014-12-31 18:53:32	I feel bad for Ole Miss.. They're playing the best team in the nation and TCU is taking all their anger out on them.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-12 19:31:29	Well, DeMarco played like DeMarco for his last game with a star on his helmet..
Great game, but blew it with his fumble.. #SprayTan

1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-13 00:09:12	@Jason_sp88 @DCBlueStar We are gonna need to find a durable RB in the draft if we want Romo to survive another season.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-13 20:04:55	@Mrocks8Sonny RW is a solid option tho.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-13 20:07:31	@Mrocks8Sonny Did you watch tape of Randle from last year to this year? The  Oline made him look like a starter.. RW is better than Joe.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-13 20:08:02	@Mrocks8Sonny Murray isn't coming back.. We used up his mileage this year I think.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-13 20:13:41	@Mrocks8Sonny I'm just saying the Oline is more valuable than DeMarco. No debate.
OLine will make out backups into stars

The Colt don't have a chance in my mind so I've already eliminated them, but we'll see.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:17:50	@Dakota05Sinchak Typical seahawks fan response. Lol
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:18:40	Idc though honestly. 
Cowboys won 11 games more than they were predicted, so come at me with that.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:21:04	@Dakota05Sinchak I liked the Seahawks until they started acting like a self entitled team.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:21:34	@Dakota05Sinchak Nah, I really could care less about any of the Super Bowl contenders this year.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:22:54	Difference between confidence and cockiness..
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:23:49	@Dakota05Sinchak USC 2006 Rose Bowl team.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:25:37	I don't like to talk about what could've happened, but Dallas deserved that chance man.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:26:02	@Dakota05Sinchak Pete Carroll.. Round 2
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:28:26	Remember when Matt Hasselback + Shaun Alexander were the face of the Seahawks? That was respectable.. 
All that is gone though.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:30:09	@DenimDann Nah, I'm not a trash talking fan and so when people come at me with that it's just kinda unsettling.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:32:41	Btw @Dakota05Sinchak, I didn't hear a word from you when yall lost to us..
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:38:20	@Dakota05Sinchak I'm just Sayin that I wasn't goin' @ Ya with the Seattle stuff.. I'm jus mad we didn't get the chance for a round 2
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:39:57	@Dakota05Sinchak I'm still salty about that catch and a little bit of trash talkin eases the pain.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:41:50	I wish Romo could've had this team 6 years ago..
That man will retire with a ring.. And Jerry is gonna make it the biggest ring yet.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:42:03	@Chappy_LS @Dakota05Sinchak Forreal Fam lol
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-18 21:13:07	Hurts to know Cowboys coulda been exploiting the Seahawks as bad as GB is.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-18 21:58:59	“@DTerrell11: Great catch @DezBryant http://t.co/xxdOPeJv7d” I don't understand how it was overturned.. Irrefutable evidence?
That's BS, man
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-18 22:01:37	I feel like I get along so much better with people that are older than me..
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-18 22:45:29	So I decided I'm going Paleo for 30 days whenever I get back to Den10.
Gonna be rough, and I might look dead for awhile, but it'll pay off.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-18 23:11:36	Can't watch this game because Italians would rather show tennis and soccer right now..
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-18 23:33:28	Who wants to have a Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl 95 watch party on Super Bowl Sunday Bc I don't wanna watch two BS teams play.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-18 23:45:30	Russell Wilson is okay, but the Seahawks as a team are 🚮.
Can't stand how cocky they are.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-20 15:55:29	“@Raymond_Mikell: I always catch myself making leg dreads when I'm bored. Thanks @erikdane52” yessir.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-20 16:09:19	So I had to print 41 pages of notes for the first day of class.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:05:49	@KaseyRobey @Seahawks Cowboys are better. 😌
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:09:01	@KaseyRobey @Seahawks 
If you saw the catch you would understand why we feel robbed.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:10:31	@KaseyRobey @Seahawks Lol, all I'm saying is that it hurts to know we beat yall @ home earlier this year and didn't get round 2.. That's all
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-19 00:11:22	Heart hurts everytime I think about that play, man.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-24 07:35:50	Alright, definitely witnessed some racial biased by some UNT cops today.
Like 6 white guys were pushed away to talk to the one black guy.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-01-24 07:36:05	It was pretty obvious what they were doing too.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 04:24:30	@theajbray Hood politics.. He "freestyled" it last week.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 04:26:18	@theajbray I was just stunned when he said it on the radio and it wasn't as amazing on a track.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 04:27:12	@theajbray I think it's a good message he's portraying, but nothing special.. At all.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 04:28:41	@theajbray King Kunta, I, and Blacker the Berry are songs I can vibe with at least..
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 04:30:48	@theajbray when I first read that I was like.. "Uhh, thanks" lol
Yeah, I like Alright and Complexion, but it's not like anything crazy.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 04:31:54	Where have I heard the bass line from Complexion from?
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 04:33:51	Complexion is the best track.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 04:36:30	@BAnderson1995 No bars tho.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 04:42:32	"i" on the album is great.. Grreeeeaaaat.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 04:47:14	Mortal Man just made the whole album good.

I'm boutta re listen now.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 04:51:05	Bro. 
King Kendrick.
Pac and Dot.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 04:53:32	@ClassKingCole I just finished it.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 04:53:52	“@theajbray: Kendrick is creative for what he did with that mortal man. like a convo between him and Tupac” That was dope.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 04:58:50	I doubted KDot.
The man is a genius, though.

Let's hope people actually hear the lesson he is giving..
It's about respect.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 04:59:44	@ClassKingCole You will want to turn it off, but it was great.. You might not realize it till the last song, but it's great.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 05:11:09	It's not bad the second time lol
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 05:14:54	Wait, wait, wait!!
I called the Pac thing!!
When he said misused you influence.. I remember Pac always Sayin that on Tupac:Resurrection.. 😌
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 05:19:10	I feel like a genius.. I solved TPAB yesterday after hearing King Kunta..
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-16 05:43:42	Hey, I know Pac was talkin bout bloodshed, but we cool, right?

True friends,
One question.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-17 05:18:45	People laughed at me when I said Kendrick was a philosopher.
Not anymore. 
The man is brilliant and he proved it to everyone yesterday.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-18 03:30:31	@theajbray My first listen I didn't like it..
Most artists I give one chance, but after 4 listens I already like it more than GKMC
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-18 03:44:52	@theajbray but you don't like 'King Kunta' or 'For Sale?'?
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-18 04:58:50	Rapsody might be one of my new favorite rappers..
Best female rapper, for sure.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-18 16:30:16	@jakerobbo_ He didn't make it to be catchy and played on the radio all day..
But it's the most lyrical album you'll hear in awhile.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-03-19 15:09:28	@MeritKay @RapFavorites Both are good, but I pick KDot bc he's my all time favorite rapper and I support West coast music over everything.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-05-20 05:08:44	I think it's had a great effect on me and most of my friends, but some people just don't handle that freedom very well.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-06-12 03:40:24	Game over, son.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-06-11 19:14:09	Watched Dexter season 1 and 2 in like a week and now I'm exhausted just thinking about starting back.. Show is stressful.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-06-13 05:18:56	@SheddJohnathan @BAnderson1995 @Drake It's actually just all Christian music.. I'm not listening to Kendrick, Q, Cole, Pac, or Pusha T
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-06-13 05:21:24	I know @RayneilWilliams probably wouldn't agree, but lyrically Lecrae crafts his song a lot like J Cole. 
Smooth and distinctive.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-06-14 00:36:48	@RayneilWilliams thought so...
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-06-14 00:38:51	@RayneilWilliams We good, kinfolk.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-06-14 17:12:33	The more I listen to Lecrae, the more I realize he is overlooked as a great artist because he is classified as a Christian artist.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-06-14 22:44:07	@shackattack1997 You aren't gonna find anyone w the NBA Finals on.

1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-06-18 22:11:19	My parents have helped me sponsor a child from Kenya for at least 10 years.
It's unbelievable how faithful he is to The Father.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-06-18 22:15:11	He expresses so much love to my family and he has never even seen us..
Occasionally I would forget to respond to his letters... (cont.)
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-06-18 22:16:54	But he would always send me scripture and send prayers for everyone despite us not always being there for him.
1268457804	erikerwin52	2015-06-18 22:26:51	Who would've thought that a 15 year old boy in Kenya would have such a strong influence on my faith.
