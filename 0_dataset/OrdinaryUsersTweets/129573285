129573285	guerrie22	2015-01-11 21:13:17	@GJanssen24 you need two steps when you're trying to catch the ball by the sideline and he took three. That's what I said to explain
129573285	guerrie22	2015-01-11 21:16:14	@GJanssen24 screw off
129573285	guerrie22	2015-01-11 21:18:34	@JTerrore I've actually always been one, I just prefer the Bills more
129573285	guerrie22	2015-01-11 21:20:11	@JTerrore I'm not like Marrone
129573285	guerrie22	2015-01-11 21:23:08	@lperry33 @JTerrore I just hope he does a good job

129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-06 14:18:08	@DevanHalton02 nice
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-06 14:19:07	@DevanHalton02 you are very welcome
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-06 16:28:56	Pumped for this #Yankees game!

129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 16:46:27	@HuntyVanGorder @DevanHalton02 I'll come along with ya
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 16:48:23	@DevanHalton02 @HuntyVanGorder I'd love to
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 02:07:16	@kelfriga @brynne_guerrie @Haje34 @_mariahleigh_ why did grandma think that was appropriate to say?
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 02:09:27	@Haje34 nice joke
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 02:10:38	@Haje34 yes! What day(s)?
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 02:11:35	@Haje34 all of them?
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 17:10:28	@HuntyVanGorder @DevanHalton02 bring it on children.
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 17:12:42	@Murch_88 Cuba wouldn't be a bad idea
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 18:13:03	@DevanHalton02 @HuntyVanGorder I'll be out later than both of you
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 18:14:41	@HuntyVanGorder @DevanHalton02 not worried at all
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 18:27:35	@HuntyVanGorder @DevanHalton02 not even the slightest
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 21:46:01	@joshshannon43 that's so beyond ridiculous.
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 21:50:41	@joshshannon43 how he didn't get caught sooner makes me absolutely shocked
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 21:54:18	@joshshannon43 it's a genius idea though. 2 years and then he got caught. That's a long ass time to be doing that and not get caught.
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 21:56:58	@joshshannon43 it's not a big deal for him because he has no other hopes of moving forward in life
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-08 21:57:56	@joshshannon43 I wonder how his dad did itüòÇ probably with the counterfeit money!
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-07 03:46:02	@a__wind I don't like the hashtag
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-10 01:02:19	@natalieevelina I actually believe that üòÇ
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-10 18:30:27	I have yet to see @rishi_kumar21 make it to class on time this whole year
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-14 19:43:00	@sydney_irish maybe you shouldn't skip philosophy and you wouldn't have that issue
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-14 19:49:03	@sydney_irish he had some funny comments today
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-16 21:13:02	@PeRsAuDbOy24 what room did you get?
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-16 21:14:15	@PeRsAuDbOy24 you're right across from me, but we have a fun floor so far
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-18 01:24:36	@natawwee what does that even mean?
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-18 01:26:33	@natawwee what a weird person
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-21 00:32:28	@GJanssen24 how much?
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-21 00:32:53	@NiccySimmons is it extremely fast delivery?
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-20 14:08:43	@onizzle88 so I can home whenever I want
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-21 16:19:51	Not really sure if I believe this or not https://t.co/wajIbCMb9t
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-21 16:20:00	@Murch_88 sick movie
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-21 16:38:49	@Murch_88 so you can pretty much do whatever you want in there hahah
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-20 15:11:25	@onizzle88 then you should do the same...
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-20 16:46:27	@onizzle88 you work every single day?
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-20 16:48:30	@onizzle88 I use my car 5 out of the 7 days a week
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-20 17:10:10	@onizzle88 you're calling me a liar?
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-20 17:13:18	@onizzle88 good one
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-22 04:55:04	@skiley16 great song
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-22 05:01:52	@skiley16 couldn't agree more!
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-23 14:33:02	@DevanHalton02 we can go golfing that day!
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-23 14:33:51	@natalieevelina I feel the same exact way
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-23 14:36:08	@natalieevelina üòÇ my motivation level is under zero
129573285	guerrie22	2015-04-23 18:07:10	@joshshannon43 @DevanHalton02 you're garbage josh.

129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-24 16:04:07	@Patrick_SmithLa always*
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-24 20:59:58	@Maggie_Dorgan5 2 pitchers in a matter of minutes?
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-24 21:16:16	@Maggie_Dorgan5 you should've seen me. I was very shocked üòÇ
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-24 21:21:52	@Maggie_Dorgan5 I'm saying when I thought 2 pitchers got hit haha
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-26 15:04:28	@ChrisCornier happy birthday man!
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-26 16:26:55	Anyone want to go to the gym right now?
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-26 16:29:18	@C_Charleston31 I don't have a place to ball this summer except for the outdoor courts which really sucks
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-26 16:31:40	@C_Charleston31 I could do that but no one goes to it. I have a membership to planet fitness but there's no gym there either
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-26 16:32:49	@ColasurdoDaniel planet fitness
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-26 16:33:58	@C_Charleston31 good point cause I just tear it up down low especially when you're guarding me
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-26 16:35:00	@ColasurdoDaniel but planet fitness is cheaper haha
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-26 16:36:26	@C_Charleston31 I may look like a white Nate Robinson with my height, but I play like Shaq
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-26 16:36:48	@cbake_16 who are you?
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-26 16:38:14	@C_Charleston31 I'm okay with that üòÇ
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-26 19:05:14	@PickNesesky have a good time doing that man!
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-26 19:19:22	@PickNesesky I think you have to
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-26 22:15:52	@cbake_16 April fools was last month...  Nice try dude
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-26 22:31:33	@cbake_16 but it was on point today
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-27 00:40:05	Probably the hardest I have ever laughed during any episode of the office https://t.co/bSKVXpGuaV
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-27 04:29:12	@jllamas_3 that's a weird time to watch any movie
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-27 18:26:10	@talynnn_ not sure if that is meant to be perverted or not
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-27 18:37:54	@talynnn_ I just need to learn that everything you say is perverted
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-28 00:48:08	@natalieevelina @Bryce_Callen thank you üòé
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-28 00:51:03	@kayyyflow we've all done it
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-27 14:56:30	@natalieevelina is that about me and @Bryce_Callen?
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-27 15:02:04	@HuntyVanGorder oh sorry Mr. Bonas
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-27 15:04:48	@HuntyVanGorder my apologies Mr. Bonas

129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-28 02:57:33	@lexigarabedian when and where?
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-28 03:00:04	@lexigarabedian if it opens back up üò¢
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-28 03:01:42	@lexigarabedian I'm down for that!
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-28 03:02:45	@lexigarabedian oh yes! We have to do that again when school starts back up!
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-28 03:03:15	@DevanHalton02 I was gonna say yes, but then I saw "8"
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-28 03:06:17	@DevanHalton02 quit your job :/
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-28 13:55:10	I have gotten murdered by mosquitos so far this summer
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-28 14:25:33	@kayyyflow you are funny
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-28 19:39:32	@a__wind would you rather watch it with dan?
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-28 19:41:25	@a__wind not a bad idea
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-28 19:42:33	@a__wind I could watch it with him, @DavidHazelet, @rishi_kumar21 and @ZackDorobiala
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-28 19:44:02	@a__wind @DavidHazelet @rishi_kumar21 @ZackDorobiala we would probably laugh during it
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-28 19:47:37	@a__wind of course you would haha
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-30 01:35:58	@NeWc_DaDdY34 @NateJennings24 Nate does have a point though
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-29 20:58:18	@DDorsino spot on

129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-30 20:37:02	@mattnapes sure
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-31 02:51:29	@NateJennings24 basketball in the morning will make up for it
129573285	guerrie22	2015-06-01 21:40:08	@RaeLynHamilton Beck winning album of the year for sure
129573285	guerrie22	2015-05-31 21:09:51	@Timschrr3 @laurenedson2 that's gross

129573285	guerrie22	2015-06-05 02:17:27	@sydney_irish maybe it's trying to tell you something
129573285	guerrie22	2015-06-06 14:47:31	@GJanssen24 Maybe. Might be busy
129573285	guerrie22	2015-06-06 16:21:02	Sounds like @Tylerliberty11  https://t.co/Mq4BiGVf5c
129573285	guerrie22	2015-06-06 16:26:33	@Tylerliberty11 I wish Bott would see that üòÇ
129573285	guerrie22	2015-06-06 16:27:15	@Tylerliberty11 does he have a Twitter?

129573285	guerrie22	2015-06-07 00:59:50	@DevanHalton02 you tweet while I'm refreshing my timeline. I can sense it
129573285	guerrie22	2015-06-07 01:00:50	@DevanHalton02 you will refer to me as that from now on.
129573285	guerrie22	2015-06-07 23:12:00	@onizzle88 @MattyIce_1534 I am not home at the moment, but it's a piece of cake playing you
