132627520	Sean__U	2013-10-24 01:32:51	@SE046 I have been so addicted to coffee lately
132627520	Sean__U	2013-10-24 02:02:03	@SE046 Starbucks is about 40% of my Amex bill
132627520	Sean__U	2013-10-24 02:23:05	@SE046 it's only like 5 dollars so worth it

132627520	Sean__U	2013-10-28 11:25:58	The man at Starbucks today is super gay! Sorry you chipped your nails making my drunk! ;(
132627520	Sean__U	2013-10-24 22:59:07	Chicken stuffed with garlic spinach and cheese, roasted rosemary potatoes and roasted mustard asparagus! Perfect dinner
132627520	Sean__U	2013-10-24 23:01:01	I think @Abercrombie is due for a comeback!
132627520	Sean__U	2013-10-25 02:37:31	@FiestaTony I am not hipster but I am a yuppie
132627520	Sean__U	2013-10-25 15:37:51	I've decided @KellyOsbourne papa don't preach is way better than @Madonna ... Just saying

132627520	Sean__U	2013-11-26 01:13:30	Dear Tom Ford your amazing... http://t.co/56NuIvHzYs
132627520	Sean__U	2013-11-26 02:16:08	@ADB110 do you make silk/linen bow ties or pocket squares or ties?
132627520	Sean__U	2013-11-26 02:26:57	@HoJoLego aww thanks. I was like hmmm log on
132627520	Sean__U	2013-11-26 02:27:38	@HoJoLego are those Tom Fords not worth the $500 ugh
132627520	Sean__U	2013-11-26 02:29:30	@HoJoLego he is timeless and forever! Die for Tom Ford &amp; Burberry
132627520	Sean__U	2013-11-26 02:54:00	@ADB110 hmm it is worth looking into, you could do super high end ties/bow ties and sell them for a massive profit
132627520	Sean__U	2013-11-26 03:04:29	@ADB110 true, however when starting a new product you want to put the best of the best out there, get an established base then go from there
132627520	Sean__U	2013-11-27 21:06:34	@JohnnyGWeir so funny, I love giving them strange looks
132627520	Sean__U	2013-11-26 22:14:29	@CourtFinley88 why is there never anything going on in Green Bay

132627520	Sean__U	2013-11-26 01:03:27	I love British TV shows however I don't ever understand what they are saying. Ugh
132627520	Sean__U	2013-12-02 02:05:36	A) Why is cable so expensive B) Is AT&amp;T a good provider
132627520	Sean__U	2013-12-02 15:45:14	@BenJBaur @TomDaley1994 agreed on that statement
132627520	Sean__U	2013-12-02 15:46:08	Reviving my twitter life is harder then keeping @lindsaylohan sober!
132627520	Sean__U	2013-12-02 16:42:48	@MSBPG well maybe yes, have to be supportive :-)
132627520	Sean__U	2013-12-02 18:45:47	Ugh ..... Target is a killer to a Amex!
132627520	Sean__U	2013-12-03 14:37:39	Can't wait for my LULU Lemon, Jack Spade, Burberry and Nordstrom's orders to come today!

132627520	Sean__U	2013-12-03 02:38:30	@davidcieslak I want that picture, it's amazing
132627520	Sean__U	2013-12-03 02:58:15	@HoJoLego can I count my real father as a sugar daddy? Or no?
132627520	Sean__U	2013-12-03 03:01:52	@HoJoLego well no he is just dad

132627520	Sean__U	2014-05-29 00:48:10	Do you ever look at people's Pinterest and think ugh that explains so much about you! #Tragic
