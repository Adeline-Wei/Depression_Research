134444672	JonaCloete	2013-11-24 14:54:03	@Zozo_Nocanda being humble is a luxury at this stage, we need competent leadership, with @AgangSA may be able to attract.
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-11-24 16:56:39	What a great single by #Musa on @IdolsSA #finale.
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-11-24 16:57:34	@ZwaiBala not too bad though, considering he is a ballads kinda guy
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-11-24 17:59:12	#CardiffCityFC spoils the party for #ManchesterUnited by holding them to a 2-2 draw that prevented them from rising to 4th spot on the log!

134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-02 12:46:03	Is South Africa moving from a democracy towards a kleptocracy? #Nkandlagate #Mobutu Sese Seko style @jankotze38 @BrenitaCloete
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-02 12:56:17	@jankotze38 We may not have Apartheid any longer, but we have widening inequalities and deepening levels of pverty and unemployment
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-04 20:44:07	@D_Sturridge @LFC What goals to watch! Missing your contribution a great deal...hope you recover speedily
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-01 16:07:04	@LFC How we miss big match temperament! We are indeed an average team. So fucken disappointed
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-01 16:08:39	@LFC Brandon Rodgers has seemed to have reached his ceiling
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-01 16:10:53	@LFC we got screwed again! Fuck all positives for Brandon Rogers to reflect on
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-06 13:59:39	#Amazon #CapeTown is about to observe a moment of silence in honour of the passing of #Mandela.
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-07 15:54:44	@LFC the number of missed opportunities makes me nervous...a reminder of last season @DJBLAZEeSA

134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-07 16:55:26	FULL-TIME: It's all over here at Anfield. Two late strikes from Luis Suarez make it #LFC 4-1 #WHU.  http://t.co/xIkOg1QpBl
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-07 14:07:59	Newcastle taking the lead against Man United! Another loss or draw? What shall it be?
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-08 18:46:18	@LiverpoolRSA @LFC Great result at the #Emirates today! Pity #Everton could not pull of another shock defeat. #YNWA
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-08 18:49:23	As SA and the world mourn #NelsonMandela's passing, I hope we will resolutely step to the plate and do his legacy proud...@AgangSA

134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-10 22:06:28	Isn't it ironic, how closeness to the levers of power makes it more difficult to understand the impatience of the downtrodden masses? #truth
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-12 09:11:43	I wonder what South Africa would have been like if there were real communists left in the #SACommunistParty? Too much theory, no praxis!

134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-22 07:42:36	"@Zwelinzima1: http://t.co/e5EBo174Er". Corruption going straight to the top of SA Government
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-22 07:44:13	@Zwelinzima1 how can we be expected to sit idly by in the face of such rampant corruption, in the name of the ANC?
134444672	JonaCloete	2013-12-22 08:10:09	@jankotze38 Nkandlagate is an apt illustration of the saying, a fish rots from its head!
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-01-12 05:41:42	@DJBLAZEeSA are they still playing football?
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-01-12 07:57:35	@DJBLAZEeSA had a lekka time at #Mzoli's yesterday
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-01-26 22:30:40	@RanjeniM It is so sad when those proclaiming to fight corruption can't identify it amongst their own! Or are they shadow boxing?
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-01-26 07:52:16	@TimesLIVE Isn't this perhaps a case of over-playing the "influence" Glynnis would bring to DA opinion on the ANC and NPA? Over selling?
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-01-26 08:25:18	@SAfmnews The Min of Basic Education should be sued for allowing the use of unsafe school facilities. One unnecessary death too many!
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-01-26 08:30:39	@SAMediaMonitor Another case of how government serves the people, only when it needs to safe face! How pathetic!
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-01-28 15:16:55	#MamphelaRamphele is talking such a lot of rubbish on #SAFM. How dare she compare her unconsulted decision to stand for DA to #Mandela?
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-01-28 15:23:43	@LouwPiet How did this catch the #ANC off guard, when her move leaves the #ANC with only the #DA  to contend with?
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-01-30 07:14:40	@Mthokozeesi Is this in order to vote DA? Or will Mamphela be the face of both parties?
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-01-30 17:21:33	@ferialhaffajee Lesson: Parties that are the brainchild of an individual "leader" will always assume their identity. So much dishonesty!
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-01-30 17:24:02	@SABreakingNews How about more honesty and admit,  MAR is now also a DA leader?
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-01-30 18:55:00	@BDliveSA Great thoughts!
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-02-17 16:33:13	What a welcome relieve to have a bit of drizzle after a scorching hot Monday in Cape Town!
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-02-23 10:24:57	The #DAManifesto Launch is such an uninspiring affair. @wilmotjames' input was so boring
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-02-23 10:29:12	Isn't it ironic that the#DA with its white liberal history has to borrow from the liberation movement.
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-02-23 10:30:16	@RanjeniM Lol! I thought the low energy affair was over prematurely!
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-02-23 10:34:52	The illusions of grandeur suffered by poor people in the #DA is actually scary, when they do not realise that the #DA will never govern SA!

134444672	JonaCloete	2014-02-23 11:01:46	Sounds like @LindiweMazibuko has practised her #Afrikaans to impress non-afrikaans speakers in Polokwane. The voice of Desperate Alliance!
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-05-24 16:35:51	@DJBLAZEeSA did you listen to #DRJules on #GHFM? Was off the hook!

134444672	JonaCloete	2014-11-23 16:01:44	@LiverpoolRSA  Brandon Rodgers looks out of sorts. Maybe we need the experience of #RafaBenitez back at Anfield!
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-11-23 16:04:07	@RedSoldier05 I don't think any of the current personnel will make a difference. #BrendonRodgers looks a shadow of his 2013-14 confidence.
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-11-23 16:10:00	@LFC without @LuisSuarez9 and @D_Sturridge #BrendonRodgers looks completely exposed...Maybe its time to cut our losses and bring Rafa back
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-11-23 18:09:58	@lfc @LuisSuarez9 the price we pay for  arrogance in selling potentially the best  LFC player ever. Chickens coming home to roos Mr Rodgers
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-11-23 18:14:10	@IdolsSA what a deserved winner...potential to become an international recording artist,
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-12-19 14:15:04	Are @FastwayCouriers employees just incompetent, or is their service promise a bunch of lies? Even phone calls go unanswered! Pathetic!
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-12-20 09:17:53	@FastwayCouriers it is VA0008813589, ZA0003149863, VA0008656505 and NA0004162029
134444672	JonaCloete	2014-12-19 14:11:35	How is it possible that 1 of my 4 overnight delivery parcel has been with @FastwayCouriers in Cape Town since 14 December? SlowwayCouriers?

134444672	JonaCloete	2015-04-09 14:26:07	Finally back on #twitter!
134444672	JonaCloete	2015-04-09 15:56:15	Jubilation here at #UCT as #Rhodeshasfallen.
134444672	JonaCloete	2015-04-09 15:57:00	Jubilation here at #UCT as #Rhodeshasfallen. The statute has been removed, hopefully to its final resting place.
134444672	JonaCloete	2015-04-09 16:07:34	#Rhodes statute has been removed by #UCT. The beginning of thoroughgoing transformation or mere symbolism?
134444672	JonaCloete	2015-04-13 12:09:53	@LindiMazibuko, in your opinion, is the #DA constituents ready to be led by a Black leader?
134444672	JonaCloete	2015-04-12 12:20:09	@RSApolitics @rayand_ what is it you suggest we should all agree on? And why is Zille stepping down "bitter  sweet"?
134444672	JonaCloete	2015-04-12 12:28:28	@ferialhaffajee Zille is trying to convince herself that springing her decision on the DA at the 11th hour is in the interest of the party.
134444672	JonaCloete	2015-04-12 12:32:49	@RanjeniM if only #Zille realized that no black leader of the DA will be seeking her counsel. They will be too proud.
134444672	JonaCloete	2015-04-12 12:33:50	@RanjeniM time for rent a leader I suppose
134444672	JonaCloete	2015-04-13 21:47:15	#plfanzone, I'm a Liverpool supporter from Cape Town. I just hope Sterling could learn from the Torres experience.
134444672	JonaCloete	2015-05-12 20:08:34	@jankotze38 if the party can't even grow its own base, how will they get this right?
