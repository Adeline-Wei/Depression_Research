1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-10-01 01:13:31	@SusannaDW  There are 3 branches to the admiralty tree: litigation,regulatory work, and commercial counseling.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-10-01 01:15:45	@SusannaDW Litigation deals with collisions, personal injury, commercial disputes and maritime insurance coverage
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-10-01 01:18:26	@SusannaDW Regulatory practice deals with US Coast Guard, Federal Maritime Commission, Dept of Labor &amp; National Transportation Safety Board.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-10-01 01:21:19	@SusannaDW Commercial counseling basically involves contract negotiation and maritime insurance coverage evaluation.

1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 02:08:25	Well, @WWATMD, I experienced some pretty stupid things today but I believe this wins...like...going away. @thnklikasoldier @prbeckman
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 02:13:27	Hey @audible_com Kissinger's Diplomacy would be a valuable addition.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 02:28:40	@mrdavidboberesq Agree to disagree there. I loved it.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 02:33:25	@steven_metz @NC_Prime @prbeckman @LawDavF @WWATMD At least people don't think you're a racist because of your degree.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 02:42:45	@mrdavidboberesq but I didn't get to experience it the first time.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 02:55:30	@steven_metz @NC_Prime @prbeckman @LawDavF @WWATMD My last prob unfair but there's been a push to get rid of "Ole Miss" for years

1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 23:10:17	@prbeckman Kissinger's Diplomacy.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 23:13:13	@prbeckman I mean they've got On China and World Order but not Diplomacy? What is this amateur hour?
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 23:14:59	@prbeckman Hell, you can even get The Influence of Sea Power Upon History.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 23:21:31	Basically, @prbeckman @USNIBooks needs a Navy version of @GarySinise to put all its books on @audible_com
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 23:28:27	@prbeckman Wish I knew someone with some influence over there that could make things happen.  @WWATMD
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 23:32:05	I mean, how much more can I do for sea power, being a simple-minded civilian? :-) @prbeckman @WWATMD
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 23:48:36	@BradMossEsq Or Coldplay
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 23:53:02	@WWATMD @prbeckman Kissinger was an advisor
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 23:53:29	@WWATMD @prbeckman Adviser
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-17 23:58:47	@WWATMD @prbeckman You'd really need a Brit, if we're being honest with ourselves
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-18 00:05:13	@WWATMD @prbeckman For the reading, not the influence.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-18 00:11:41	@prbeckman @WWATMD Just offer the actor a 5-million-year-long membership in @NavalInstitute
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-18 00:29:52	@prbeckman @WWATMD Seriously though youd b looking for a Sinise-type whos in it more for the message than the money. There may b 1 or 2 left
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-18 01:03:44	@prbeckman @WWATMD @USNIBooks This was more wishful thinking than a serious suggestion. Sarcasm doesn't seem to work too well on this thing.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-18 01:06:50	@prbeckman @WWATMD @USNIBooks A serious suggestion would be to do it for books like the Classics of Sea Power Series
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-18 01:27:34	@WWATMD @prbeckman You'll have to pardon me, I sometimes forget my Navy is controlled by materialists and none of those books matter :-)
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-18 01:29:57	@WWATMD @prbeckman Many are already "on-tape" by the way.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-18 01:42:06	@WWATMD @prbeckman Yeah, my Navy, your Navy, our Navy.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-18 02:40:50	@WWATMD @prbeckman This obviously requires some clarification. First, if anyone was offended by the "my Navy" comment, I want to apologize.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-18 02:42:05	@WWATMD @prbeckman The Navy belongs to all of us. I have a profound respect for those who serve &amp; if any were offended I am sincerely sorry.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-18 02:42:56	@WWATMD @prbeckman Second, I did not mean @NavalInstitute is controlled by materialists. As @WWATMD points out USNI and the Navy are
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-18 02:45:25	@WWATMD @prbeckman &amp; by materialists I meant the school of naval thought that relies on technology
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-18 02:46:11	@WWATMD @prbeckman at the expense of strategic theory &amp; history.

1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-29 03:43:01	@Doctrine_Man Yes, it's why he's "unbroken"
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-29 04:24:36	@Doctrine_Man Yeah. "Unfortunate" is the right word. I understand why she made the choice.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2014-12-30 18:21:06	Did @NavalWarCollege ever publish “The Littoral Combat Ship: How We Got Here and Why” by @DepSecDefWork? I just have "working paper version.

1368344516	MSNavalist	2015-01-22 00:43:28	I can't do this, Sam.
I know. It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2015-01-22 00:43:56	The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger, they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2015-01-22 00:44:23	Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
1368344516	MSNavalist	2015-01-22 00:44:46	But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2015-01-22 00:45:40	And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something...
1368344516	MSNavalist	2015-01-22 00:46:16	even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.
1368344516	MSNavalist	2015-01-22 00:47:09	Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going. Because they were holding on to something...
1368344516	MSNavalist	2015-01-22 00:47:47	Frodo: What are we holding onto, Sam?

Sam: That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo... and it's worth fighting for.
