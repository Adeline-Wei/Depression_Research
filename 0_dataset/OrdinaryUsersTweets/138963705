138963705	Kassandra077	2014-08-31 02:21:55	@mirandajcoates Anytime! I'd hate to see a friend put themselves down like that.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-08-31 02:25:05	@mirandajcoates Absolutely! If you ever need someone to talk to about anything, I'm here.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-08-31 02:34:01	I like Shake It Off, but it's just not the old Taylor Swift that I loved😭 Please go back to the country Taylor.

138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-06 21:04:34	Finally home from Buda🙏 I'm exhausted &amp; all I wanna do is sleep.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-06 22:11:57	My twitter unfollowed so many people...ugh.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-07 22:34:32	Thank you Jesus!!! Finally have my old #, restored my my current phone, and I have every text, app, and picture back.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-07 22:34:52	The loser that has my phone can keep it. It's useless anyways.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-06 22:50:40	Left my clothes in Buda.. Terrific.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-06 22:59:41	@ThatMoonKid_11 I wish that applied to me too.

138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-11 00:33:29	Time to start the dreadful homework 😓
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-11 00:39:14	Trying to rap The Last is like the hardest thing ever, cause Gambino takes like two seconds to breathe at the most.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-11 00:39:40	I was breathing like I was someone in the fat man relay.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-11 00:43:26	Actually it's not hard... I'm just really bad it.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-09 17:19:16	This sucks.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-10 02:22:39	Going home with a stiff back, no dinner, and tons of homework: essays, textbook problems, videos, you name it.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-10 02:29:19	Most relationships fail because one of them likes to put dumb shit on social media.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-11 02:10:22	But you're still the same.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-11 02:41:42	I've been staring at this blank Word document for a good 15 minutes now...
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-11 02:42:28	Turning in work completed at the last minute &amp; the teachers still love it.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-14 22:00:30	Watching @adhd_7 fish, taking pictures of dolphins &amp; turtles, and eating Oreos. #PortA #WishinIWasFishin

138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-17 02:46:26	@stephelynn_97 hahaha... No amount of money will help save lives unless you take that course... So take it! And have fun. 👍
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-19 01:10:55	@sierragorman4 Yeah Jac told me, but I had just finished eating with my dad so I didn't go!
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-19 01:28:35	So I've been thinking...
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-19 01:49:48	lol we're all screwed up in our own ways.
138963705	Kassandra077	2014-09-21 01:44:57	That ice cream cake was deeeeelish
