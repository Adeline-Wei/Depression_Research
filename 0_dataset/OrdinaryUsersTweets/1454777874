1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-04-27 22:31:25	When you start watching law and order, you can't stop
1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-04-27 23:19:39	When my dad threatens if I don't eat dinner I don't get dessert, okay I'm not 5 anymore
1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-04-28 21:15:11	Who cares about Mr. Abood's homework, I'm gonna watch Netflix 😊

1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-04-28 22:34:30	The weather has been so depressing lately
1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-04-29 01:46:36	To the so called 'man' screaming and swearing at his wife and children downstairs in my apartment, can you please STFU
1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-04-30 12:58:13	When your mom forgets to turn the heat on and your freezing cold at night 😖
1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-04-28 03:57:50	I hate group message sometimes @LadyEmmaRose @D_Talbot_
1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-04-30 20:28:04	It's the worst to get sick on vacation 😞
1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-04-30 21:28:36	Dress, alterations, shoes, hair, nails, limo, tux = $$ + lots of stress #promproblems
1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-04-30 22:36:33	It wasn't meant to be easy, the challenge is the best part
1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-05-05 01:14:00	School tomorrow 😭💔
1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-05-05 21:07:31	Starting to clean your room then you look at all the stuff you have to do and just quit
1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-05-06 02:12:52	Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain ☺💃☔
1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-05-07 01:26:10	Screaming for my dad to kill a bug in my room but he doesn't hear me cause he's too busy watching the bruins...I could've died
1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-05-08 01:41:48	When your neck hurts so bad you can't move it 😭
1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-05-06 17:28:06	According to Mr. Abood, essentially no guy cares about anything a girl cares about 😝
1454777874	ColleenHagan31	2014-05-08 03:11:20	I believe there's one person in the world that is perfectly meant for me, and I believe that person is you ❤
