1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-06-02 23:08:31	Time for some self-promotion, I guess?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-06-10 18:42:49	The Microsoft #E3 conference was... good? Lots of "run and shoot while the camera goes insane" games. Crimson Dragon looks good though!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-06-11 17:40:03	That trailer made me feel like an awkward 13 year old again. #FinalFantasyXV
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-06-18 01:41:15	Friend: "Hey, do you wanna go and watch that new Superman movie?" Me: "No. I have to find a sprite of a dead horse." #RPGMaker
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-06-20 16:09:29	@MissStrawberrii Going pretty well! though LINUS has been in development for like... years. What about you? How's your project going?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-06-19 16:38:44	@MissStrawberrii Ha ha. It's always good to find fellow RM developers. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-06-28 03:38:19	Inspirations for my game: #GameofThrones #Suikoden #HarryPotter What could go wrong? ;p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-03 14:06:06	@NocturnalOwlie UGH THAT DESERT.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-04 17:48:52	Ugh. Fireworks. My poor dog. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-03 16:53:10	@NocturnalOwlie Likewise! I'm a big fan of your BOF and Chrono Cross Let's Plays. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-04 19:14:22	@NocturnalOwlie I knew this kid who blew off his thumb once with an M80. So yeah, not a big fan. My dog goes crazy whenever they go off too.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-04 19:15:16	@Celianna_C Kids in New York are caraaazy when it comes to the 4th of July. Makes me miss living in Europe. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-04 19:23:57	@NocturnalOwlie That's because your cat is actually Vin Diesel.  #catmouflage
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-04 19:37:39	@AlexHonnold You probably get this a lot but I just wanted to say that you're one of my personal heroes. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-07 00:16:36	@NocturnalOwlie Its actually okay if you don't play the first one! But I highly recommend 2. Its easily one of the best RPGs ever made. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-07 00:28:43	@NocturnalOwlie Nope. Its a different story with different characters. There are some small references but they're stand alone games. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-06 17:10:40	@NocturnalOwlie I personally find the Tales games to be really long and bloated and not very interesting story-wise. :/
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-06 23:54:18	@NocturnalOwlie If you're thinking of doing a blind LP of a classic RPG, may I suggest Suikoden 2? Don't think I've ever seen anyone do one.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-01 16:25:10	@Celianna_C That looks yummy. What's in it? :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-06-30 23:48:20	@MissStrawberrii I've just downloaded your demo. Gonna give you my thoughts when I'm done! :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-01 00:00:00	This is glorious. http://t.co/PCMcWgEpxS
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-08 00:24:07	I could listen to this song every day and never get tired of it: http://t.co/7bZ9OsMbcU #Nier
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-08 00:33:56	@NocturnalOwlie It is! It's interesting because the whole thing is sung in a made-up language. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-08 00:43:48	Why don't people ever yawn in videogames?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-01 01:39:03	@Celianna_C Just wanted to say that I'm a huge fan of your art! I'm so thankful that you're a part of our community. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-07 14:56:08	Sometimes I just wanna build a Lego city and rampage through it like a rogue Megazord. #depression
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-02 00:59:53	@MissStrawberrii Thanks :p Took ages to finish though!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-02 16:58:46	@evileagles_ thanks! i put way too much effort into graphics. probably should focus more on the stuff that matters. like gameplay and story
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-08 15:32:50	@Celianna_C That bread looks awesomely polygonal. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-09 03:40:41	Ugh. I hate writer's block. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-09 19:49:32	@NocturnalOwlie I'm in the beta too. Pretty fun game. Just don't pick Gladiator! They're booooring!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-09 20:06:03	I am fucking destroying at ISketch today.#productivity
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-11 21:53:20	@MissStrawberrii You probably just need a break. It would be depressing if an artist just decided to not create art anymore. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-11 22:13:47	I bought a banjo today.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-11 01:54:00	@NocturnalOwlie Of course I do ha ha. Best comedy folk duo ever. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-12 01:59:20	Summer Palace is the best movie I've seen in a long while. http://t.co/NDMS0NQ0HR
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-13 01:29:53	@mckziggy Basically how you said earlier. If enemies touch you=you die.There are little puzzles you can solve to survive encounters though.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-13 01:30:45	@mckziggy like knocking over cabinets and stuff to keep them from stabbing you in the face. you know, things like that. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-13 01:56:54	@mckziggy That sounds fun. IMO think horror games are best when they make you feel helpless, but yeah stealth kills would be cool.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-12 17:29:12	Is it weird that all of my favourite videogames are super depressing?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-13 22:01:31	@mckziggy I'm glad you're enjoying it! Just steer clear of the fan art. Some of it can be a bit... yeah.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-13 22:25:29	@mckziggy IMO it would've been a better game if Ib was 15 years older with a noice rack and if Duke Nukem was the main character instead.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-14 15:52:50	@Celianna_C yeah. I saw the trailer for the sequel and thought "Wow. that looks good" and proceeded to watch the first one. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-12 22:35:52	@mckziggy "Every You &amp; Every Me" will forever be wonderful song, even post-goth kid phase. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-13 00:56:24	@MissStrawberrii Do you have a PS3 by any chance? You could play it on that. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-13 01:03:21	@mckziggy Is your MC supposed to be a helpless normal person? If so, I think going with how horror RPGs (like Ib) do it would work well.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-13 01:38:13	@MissStrawberrii Ah. That sucks. Well I think the next phase of the beta (phase 4) is going to allow people to play without a promo code. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-13 02:06:40	@mckziggy Yeah that game is brilliant. I love how you feel this growing dread as you play it, even with the outdated SNES-era graphics.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-13 06:36:50	@Archeia_Nessiah I loved that song when I first heard it. I hope they release a longer version at some point,
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-15 22:13:58	@Celianna_C Holy crap. Do you live in a rural area?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-16 01:49:36	Persona 4 is fucking amazing. That is all.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-14 00:57:06	Just finished watching How to Train Your Dragon. Better than any film Pixar has put out in the past couple of years.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-16 17:53:28	Thinking of doing a mapping tutorial. Anyone know any good freeware recording software?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-16 19:24:22	@Celianna_C This will work marvelously. Thanks a lot!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-18 02:35:48	I've made a parallax mapping tutorial for beginners. Check it out! https://t.co/PE7l1U1cxk #RPGMaker
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-18 16:26:49	My crappy hole-in-the-wall gym closed down. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-19 19:44:20	I want to play the Last of Us and Journey so, so, so bad. Why did I buy a 360 instead of a PS3?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-22 00:52:35	Thinking of making a Boardwalk Empire-inspired RPG where you play as a gang of rum smugglers in a 1920s fantasy analogue #TooManyIdeas
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-19 01:22:00	@MissStrawberrii A flamboyantly dressed bear.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-22 15:46:45	@evileagles_ I loved this film. Phil Fish is a fascinating guy.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-22 16:03:21	@mckziggy Ha ha. If you're serious about a collab, I'm down for it at some point! :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-22 16:20:31	@evileagles_ I'm curious. How do they differ? I'm asking because it's fun to hear people's different ideas about game design. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-21 04:50:05	Decided to randomly play my old abandoned acoustic guitar today when like four spiders scurried out of it and crawled up my arms. #NOPE
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-22 16:37:02	@evileagles_ Games without conflict is a fun idea. I mean Id love to play a story-oriented game thats all about having fun. Without killing.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-22 16:39:07	@evileagles_ Like, imagine a game like this: You have to take your kids to the amusement park! Be careful they don't get lost! #HappyGaming
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-22 16:43:32	@evileagles_ I actually haven't played FEZ yet. Should probably get on that at some point. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-23 03:08:16	Pretty much my favourite thing ever: http://t.co/3a3uh9uhop
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-28 08:31:40	@Celianna_C I'm sorry, but that pizza looks fucking delicious. The cake too. Now I'm hungry.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-27 23:30:48	@mckziggy I'm also still interested! Maybe we can talk more about it via IM or something?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-07-27 18:54:17	Rewriting the intro to your game suuuuuucks.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-02 03:00:09	@rpgmaker Oh cool. Thanks so much! :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-03 13:34:54	@NocturnalOwlie Oh... Seems I need to work on my Japanese a bit more. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-03 14:29:17	@evileagles_ What is that lady doing to that poor animal?!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-02 03:02:23	How have I not gotten into My Morning Jacket until now? #shame
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-01 09:34:30	Breath of Fire 6 for tablets? And it's an online touch RPG? Sigh.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-03 13:19:27	@NocturnalOwlie I completely agree!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-05 19:37:58	It's depressing but I just can't get into Doctor Who. I feel so left out.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-07 10:39:23	Life's Goal: Purchase a small boat. Sail it north along the eastern Canadian coast. Don't stop.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-09 02:57:43	@mckziggy there's an old Spanish legend that claims that moths are actually dead relatives coming to pay you a visit. sleep well!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-09 13:55:30	Game Idea: Youre a young engineer waking up in an empty destroyed world. You have 10,000 days to build a civilization. Also- Killer robots,
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-13 00:29:44	Is it bad if your hands tremble at random points throughout the day? Maybe I should see a doctor.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-13 20:30:37	This Snow Piercer film looks incredible. Not a fan of the "let's edit the fuck out of it for Western audiences" shit though.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-15 01:00:02	When you're working on your game, unplug your ethernet cable. You'll get tons of shit done.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-15 16:56:40	I was walking home late last night and got lost. I was very close to boarding a train to New Brunswick, but decided not to.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-16 05:28:57	Is Daniel Johnston dead? I hope not.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-16 23:25:34	@mckziggy I am in love with this band. Teen Dream is one of the most amazing albums of the past decade, I think.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-17 00:23:07	Seriously considering signing up for sailing lessons.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-16 21:33:01	@mckziggy Yeah, he's great. Too bad he doesn't seem to make his own music anymore.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-17 02:16:16	Here's the intro of a game I'm working on. http://t.co/POzFk5LQyn #indieRPG
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-17 02:29:43	@KeenanThompson Are you immortal?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-17 16:07:28	Get me some sticks, some bread, and some breadsticks.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-20 18:00:47	Stop cutting away from the direct feed trailers to pan to the crowd. Please? #playstationgc
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-22 16:53:44	@Celianna_C i'd love to properly visit japan at some day! our flight stops in tokyo for a few hours but that's it. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-21 06:51:16	When I was in 7th grade I was in a Blink 182 cover band called "Nirvana 2".
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-21 06:56:51	Midgar. http://t.co/lS3Euh0sfD
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-23 04:15:44	I thought it was okay to like Ben Affleck these days? Why is everyone complaining about him being Batman?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-23 17:02:28	Holy fuck Bioshock Infinite.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-22 19:08:37	@NocturnalOwlie Why aren't you recording yourself playing this? I think this would make an incredible LP.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-23 23:47:25	@mckziggy Yup, first time playing it. It easily has the most impressive fictional soup can labels i've ever seen in a game.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-25 06:48:00	Another restless night. Time to stay up and do nothing until the sun comes up.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-22 16:45:22	@Celianna_C We're going to be traveling around the country throughout December and will leave after the New Year. Have you ever been? :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-24 17:14:51	@NocturnalOwlie smack the brain teeth!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-24 19:42:42	The part in Infinite where you see Elizabeth dancing happily on the pier is maybe one of the most beautiful and poignant moments ever.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-26 03:37:48	@Archeia_Nessiah Is this a new project? It looks really cool!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-26 00:54:13	Now that you're a part of our secret society of demon hunters, here's a pair of leather pants.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-26 20:41:20	@NocturnalOwlie This sounds delicious and very rustic. *hungry now*
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-26 20:44:34	@NocturnalOwlie You mentioned beetroot! No one eats that but farmers!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-27 19:17:14	@mckziggy Some people hate not having any agency while playing. They just arent comfortable sitting there and having a story told to them.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-27 19:19:43	@MissStrawberrii I'm the same way. For me I just kind of lose interest after a while. I need context to play a videogame.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-27 20:54:16	Greyhound don't float on water.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-27 18:48:41	@mckziggy Yeah, this upsets me to end as well. You want an open narrative? Play an MMORPG or an Elder Scrolls game.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-27 19:18:20	@mckziggy It's weird, and kind of scary for people like me who enjoy storytelling. Thankfully games dont seem to be going in that direction.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-30 18:44:10	The rap/hip-hop station in Saints Row IV is the only one worth listening to.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-31 00:25:49	It's hard being a Yankees fan sometimes.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-31 00:29:32	@mckziggy This sounds awesome. Like something out of FFXII.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-31 01:08:03	Wow my mapping tutorial video has like 3,000 views. I'm happy that a lot of folks seem to have found a use for it. http://t.co/fb3nWpBYMd  .
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-31 01:28:53	Is Mass Effect 3 worth playing through?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-28 21:42:22	I think I'm half an hour away from beating Infinite. Not a big fan of the direction the story's gone. Hopefully the ending's good!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-28 23:00:43	Could really go for some sushi right now.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-01 01:58:57	Ugh. Just wrote a scene that I thought was amazing on paper but it came out really tacky and horrible in-game.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-31 18:34:08	@RPGmakerweb Filled up music folder with a bunch of FFVI and Chrono Trigger mp3s, ballooning up my project to 400 MB. #1stRPGMakerProblems
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-01 02:12:38	Dragon Age 3 looks soooo good.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-29 21:55:33	The writing in this scene is just beautiful: http://t.co/NczZubpv9d
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-08-30 06:42:54	Linkin Park's "In The End" is still a really good song.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-02 08:24:50	Making some incredible progress on LINUS. Demo might be released sometime early next year if I don't suddenly become lazy.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-03 19:46:32	@NocturnalOwlie Wow. Are you in med-school or something?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-03 20:06:10	@NocturnalOwlie That sounds insane. Good on you for sticking through it though! :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-06 03:14:33	@Celianna_C She broke my heart in Bridge to Terabithia. ;(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-03 13:54:28	Had a dream that I was afflicted with a strange disease that caused pointy seashells to erupt out of my arms. Fucking weird.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-04 17:23:52	@theLotusWar Haha. Thanks for watching. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-08 04:00:48	@NocturnalOwlie Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons is a really beautiful game akin to Journey and ICO. It's only a few hours long too.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-08 04:08:59	@NocturnalOwlie Definitely! It's a very simple yet captivating game. I finished it in one sitting because I couldnt stop playing.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-09 02:40:08	@NocturnalOwlie You're LPing Xenogears? @_@
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-09 02:50:52	@NocturnalOwlie I'm really excited for it! Just that it's a monster of a game. Kind of worried how long it might take you to LP it is all.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-09 03:02:47	@NocturnalOwlie It is generally longer than VII. Like 60-70 hours if you're slow about things. It is quite an incredible experience though.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-10 00:53:28	New Arcade Fire single is pretty dope.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-10 01:17:54	Feel like going on a Marco Polo-inspired odyssey from China to Italy. My current facial-hair isn't cutting it however.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-10 02:37:29	@mckziggy Gotta love the random Bowie vocals coming in out of nowhere.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-10 18:14:08	Easily my favourite game of the year. http://t.co/WqHVQjhrHC #feels #brothers #ataleoftwosons
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-08 00:28:54	@Celianna_C Police office sounds cool.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-13 17:18:31	Just ate like an entire package of these. So good. http://t.co/tH3KbpQxBi
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-11 09:54:45	@patrickklepek Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides. It's being adapted into an HBO series.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-14 17:42:40	I'm sad that there's not a country called Fireland somewhere with an anti-Sigur Ros as its most beloved export.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-14 17:44:50	They could be called "Sour Ros". #horriblejoke
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-15 17:45:07	Watched like four episodes of Orphan Black last night. Such a great show.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-17 22:39:03	@mckziggy Good luck with the interview dude. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-17 22:43:33	@NocturnalOwlie Sounds interesting. Thanks, Owlie!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-19 23:48:27	@NocturnalOwlie Yeah, Xenogears easily has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a game. I especially love the ending vocal theme. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-20 22:30:13	Reading 'All Our Wonder Unavenged' makes me want to move to Nova Scotia. Or Cornwall. Or Washington state. Or anywhere with lonely beaches.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-21 02:30:13	@NocturnalOwlie That's one of my favourite motifs in the soundtrack :p. I like it a lot in this piece as well. http://t.co/7NOWQE7bTc
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-21 06:53:46	The Telegraph is a pretty shitty newspaper.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-19 00:11:41	@NocturnalOwlie Where did you leave off? I can probably find the songs for you on youtube.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-19 00:50:22	@NocturnalOwlie Ah okay then :).
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-19 01:05:49	Bought this today at a store in Park Slope. Felt like I needed some Autumn reading material. http://t.co/l9veam9Sdp
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-19 15:38:48	@NocturnalOwlie I think this is is the track that plays: http://t.co/sRrYeuprUs
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-24 16:14:19	Tried baking a cake. Ended up with a sandwich. #effort
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-27 16:59:50	@NocturnalOwlie It says the video is private, Weird. I was looking forward to seeing you get lost in Aveh. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-27 19:03:51	I don't know why, but I can't be bothered to start watching the new season of Legend of Korra.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-27 23:32:41	@Celianna_C The whole thing just reminds me of the Harry Potter epilogue. Which is not good in any shape or form.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-28 04:12:27	Suddenly, I remember that the 90s band Bush existed at some point and that their song "Machinehead" had a fucking amazing guitar riff.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-02 09:30:13	@NocturnalOwlie Not really. Aside from Dan yelling at you, it's basically all Wiseman speaking cryptically to Fei. It's not worth it IMO.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-09-29 04:33:21	@evileagles_ Can't it be both?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-02 18:42:57	Oh god. Do any 20-somethings remember this song from highschool? http://t.co/4pMU35fKAC
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-05 09:13:27	Requiem For A Dreamcast #AddaWordRuinaMovie
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-05 09:26:42	The Girl With the How to Train Your Dragon Tattoo #AddaWordRuinaMovie
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-07 08:08:31	@SorceressKyrsty That looks amazing. How long did it take you to make?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-06 18:24:37	'Bear' by the Antlers is such an amazing song: http://t.co/8fWVhe2UBn
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-08 19:24:42	@NocturnalOwlie It's called "Bonds of Sea and Fire", and as far as I know there's nothing spoilery about the title. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-08 20:08:20	@NocturnalOwlie It's really beautiful theme. The soundtrack has even better pieces in it though. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-12 01:59:43	Just watched the Talented Mr. Ripley. Matt Damon is fucking amazing in it.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-13 05:27:30	I love it when games have romantic relationships that don't involve the main character at all.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-15 16:39:33	Why is it so hard for non-native speakers to make the "R" sound in French? &gt;:(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-15 16:50:39	@Celianna_C Whenever I attempt it, it comes out very harsh and gurgling, so I end up sounding like an angry German.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-15 16:59:08	@Celianna_C  I can do the rolling R (I'm a native Spanish speaker), but I'm incapable of doing it while speaking French for some reason. &gt;:(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-14 13:33:24	@Celianna_C Is it your first time watching?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-14 13:40:58	@Celianna_C Nice! Looking forward to reading more of your reactions ha ha. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-14 13:42:45	@evileagles_ Nothing important. Just traveling around for a few weeks :) Have you been?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-14 13:55:18	@evileagles_ I was really interested in entering that, but ugh, too busy these days. Can't wait to play Sayoko though. Looks really cool.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-13 18:41:11	@NocturnalOwlie That sucks. Did it not record your commentary or the game's audio?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-13 18:55:22	@NocturnalOwlie I can always find you the music for certain scenes if you tell me where you left off. It might save you some work.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-16 22:03:48	Kendrick Lamar is a good rapper.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-17 02:28:50	@MissStrawberrii Awesome! Good luck with it, stephy. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-14 16:55:43	@MissStrawberrii You can just write some crazy stream of consciousness thing. Just as long as you don't stop. That's what a lot of folks do.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-17 16:16:11	@evileagles_ I get sleep paralysis too. It's the absolute worst. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-18 20:48:08	Forgot how much I enjoy listening to The Cure.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-20 14:29:37	I wonder how the dudes who are secretly the Green Ranger feel about St. Paddy's Day?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-20 20:37:16	I need a new show to binge watch. Any recommendations?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-20 17:53:04	@evileagles_ It's the kind of game where the less said about it the better. You just have to play through it yourself.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-23 02:01:31	@Celianna_C Who doesn't ship those two? :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-21 01:34:59	@NocturnalOwlie Everything I know about that show can be condensed into two words: 'Space Australians'. Is there more to it than that? :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-21 02:56:31	@NocturnalOwlie Alright then! I'll check it out. Only because you're always going on about it in your videos. ^^
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-22 16:48:49	I'm probably the only one in the world who prefers the Roxas part of Kingdom Hearts II to the rest of the game.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-27 02:21:17	@Celianna_C I'm kind of a nature geek so I'm into leaves being strewn everywhere. I mean, as long as they aren't wet or anything.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-24 03:03:05	Tonight I am going to steal a cake.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-26 20:47:38	Days like these I wish I lived in a house with a porch covered in leaves. #fall
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-28 05:19:45	Xica da Silva is the best telenovela of all time.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-28 14:31:51	Had a dream that someone cut off my face and threw it into the sea. I remember it spinning through the air like a frisbee.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-29 18:53:17	@NocturnalOwlie I wish it would rain here. It's been sunny yet cold for the past few weeks. &gt;:(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-10-31 10:48:10	Think I might watch Empire Records tonight because why not
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-03 03:55:14	@NocturnalOwlie It's an amazing game though. One of the best indie RPGs ever IMO.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-03 04:47:09	@NocturnalOwlie It's not just like a straight horror-game either. It also has a pretty touching story with great characters. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-03 03:11:33	@NocturnalOwlie It does have jump scares. But it also has some really unnerving ambiance as well.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-06 08:45:31	@NocturnalOwlie That 'In the Shadows' song was pretty dope. I used to annoy my friends by constantly singing the "OoOoOOh!' part. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-10 05:31:58	Today I met a girl who was studying to be train conductor. How cool is that?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-08 09:43:06	@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN I want this book.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-11 00:46:51	Really excited for the new Childish Gambino album.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-09 04:08:12	I wonder if watching a stream of someone developing their game would be interesting.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-11 18:05:17	I wonder if in a hundred years the videogame medium will have classic "jazz standard"-like games that are "covered" by different developers.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-11 18:06:52	Imagine if Super Metroid was treated like 'Amazing Grace' or something, with several different renditions and designs. It'd be interesting.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-18 08:57:26	@NocturnalOwlie I have actually yet to play Journey :(. Hoping it's released on PS4 eventually.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-18 08:58:29	@MissStrawberrii Hexen? I remember that game from when I was 12. I'm surprised people still play it. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-18 09:02:03	@DrRoboturtle Yeah, I wish there were more games are out there that focus on co-operating without using violence as an incentive.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-18 09:03:07	@DrRoboturtle Wouldn't it be awesome if there was something with a Skyrim-like world where the goal is to explore with your friends?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-14 11:18:32	Is anyone planning on getting a next-gen console? And if so, which one?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-17 21:10:57	Nicholas Sparks is to literature what Call of Duty is to videogames.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-17 23:07:07	Bronx clouds http://t.co/a3AedVjni3
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-17 23:29:10	Multiplayer games where you don't compete but help each other out. Also no killing involved. Are there any besides Minecraft and Journey?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-19 02:40:29	Just wrote an entire sidequest for my game that revolves around a cooking competition because why the fuck not
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-19 12:09:36	@NocturnalOwlie I don't have a PS3, sadly. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-19 13:36:45	Just had Beyond: Two Souls spoiled for me by a videogame journalist who I otherwise really respect. Thanks a lot, @leighalexander !
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-20 00:26:50	@NocturnalOwlie No, you wouldn't, And Lunar 2 is a great game! I'd watch an LP of that. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-21 03:41:31	@MissStrawberrii @Celianna_C He was trying to get me to donate some money to his church. I have nothing against religious people, but
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-21 03:43:46	@MissStrawberrii @Celianna_C he made his intentions known after we were chatting for like half an hour about totally unrelated stuff.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-21 03:45:58	@MissStrawberrii @Celianna_C Imagine if you're talking to someone about something, then they randomly say "give my church money? Please?"
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-21 03:46:45	@MissStrawberrii @Celianna_C It's just a bit weird is all! Especially since he was a really cool and charming guy.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-23 16:53:19	Would be nice if I could reincarnate as a new person every few years like Dr Who.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-22 00:02:20	Telltale Games + Game of Thrones #fuckyes
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-11-24 15:59:37	Looking forward to P5, though I hope the translation is less awkward than it was in 4.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-02 05:09:24	If I had divine powers I would give Cary Elwes the kind of incredible George Clooney-like career he deserves. #PrincessBride
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-02 20:37:52	Really happy with how the first batch of concept art came out for LINUS. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-02 21:04:14	I've just realized that I haven't listened to any music today. Must be why I'm feeling so terrible.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-02 21:17:54	@NocturnalOwlie Do you have "Go-gurt" in Finland? It's yoghurt that comes in a 'portable tube'. Truly one of the scariest American products.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-01 05:02:22	@Celianna_C I'd be down for a kilt. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-06 14:00:46	I wish I had online friends to play multiplayer games with. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-07 00:21:06	@DrRoboturtle Oh man. Suikoden 2 is my videogame muse. Kind of weird that its amazing sprite-style isn't replicated too often.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-07 03:21:10	@DrRoboturtle Ha ha. I still have no idea what color Flik's hair is. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-12 16:00:58	God I love Fire Emblem.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-13 13:42:58	It's 7 AM, I haven't slept all night and I'm about to watch The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride. Something has gone wrong.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-14 02:33:23	I don't know why people dislike packing for trips so much.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-15 13:33:26	@qnumoon &lt;3 this song and album.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-15 18:14:27	Am I crazy if I say that I actually like cutscenes in games when they're written and directed well?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-15 18:15:28	I don't get the cries for "plz don't take away my player agency!" these days. I mean, maybe I just like films too much...
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-15 18:16:29	... and don't mind a marrying of the two mediums as long as it's done well.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-15 18:19:04	There's room for games like Dark Souls as well as games likes The Last of Us. There can be different storytelling methods...
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-15 18:20:52	... so yeah, I don't think a game being "film-like" should be judged as an automatic negative. That's all. END RANT.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-15 18:59:10	@NocturnalOwlie In that case they're just fun to watch for the hilarity. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-15 20:05:31	@NocturnalOwlie I'm a fan of your Tegan and Sarah hair.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2013-12-16 06:50:47	Goodbye twitter, for a month at least. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-03 18:05:59	Girl, you must be To The Moon, because you make me feel like... emotions n shit #indiegamepickuplines
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-06 09:36:41	'Antebellum' is probably the coolest word ever.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-04 04:10:49	In my new project you play as a 16-year old girl who has to take care of her two younger siblings in an abandoned, decaying world.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-04 04:12:08	Also, there are cows, wolves, and disease.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-04 04:16:45	Here's the title screen: http://t.co/UePeSWZ5Sr
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-04 04:23:50	I'm thinking of incorporating a strict system where the player has to keep track of the days in the year.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-04 04:26:10	With them having to do certain things on certain days, like give their younger siblings radiation medication in a timely manner.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-04 04:27:31	It'll be up to the player to keep their days as well as their activities organized. If they don't then things will go bad rather quickly.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-04 04:29:41	Oh and there are no other human beings in this world besides Adeline, Seth, and Annie. So it will be a very lonely, contemplative game.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-04 04:30:26	I'm so stoked about this project. Fuck.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-04 05:55:13	@backcountrycom @AlexHonnold @cedarwright Anyone know the song that plays at the end of these videos with the kids singing?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-04 08:54:05	@evileagles_ Thanks for the RT. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-04 21:10:56	@qnumoon Thanks! I pretty much stole the plot concept from the film Winter's Bone though. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-09 04:43:57	Chrono Trigger is basically the best thing.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-10 18:34:25	Linus has the option of paying one of his guards to go retrieve the lady's ring from the sewer instead of going himself. 'Cause fuck sewers.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-12 21:32:40	Never Let Me Go is such a great film.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-14 20:21:26	Watched Frozen today. Really liked it, but I still think Tangled is the best modern Disney film.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-16 23:54:07	This song from Frozen is really fucking good. http://t.co/cS9WHCVPKp
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-18 16:25:37	@evileagles_  This looks incredible. Congrats!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-18 16:27:57	@sandkatt Could really go for some Powerstone and Grandia 2 right now.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-15 14:39:26	When I was 12 I secretly mailed my GBA to a girl in Lebanon I met online. I wonder if she still has it? I kind of want it back now.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-18 22:16:42	@evileagles_ Your game is super fun! This is as high as I got :p http://t.co/0VpAFmCLbI
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-15 15:21:45	@C_H_Fracassi Seriously the coolest thing for people like me who missed out on PS3. Can't wait. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-19 17:33:31	@evileagles_ Ha ha. So is it safe to say that I hold the Alex Gets Oppai high-score?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-19 17:46:23	@MattWBowyer Hey Matt. Really enjoyed your last LP. Are you guys planning on doing another Start to Finish?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-19 19:38:37	@evileagles_ @_@ I call hax. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-21 09:45:44	The futuristic videogames in the film 'Her' were really cool.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-23 02:10:44	@Oceans_Dream Best FF town ever,
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-22 21:52:50	Also today I accidentally dropped my glasses into a pot of soup.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-25 22:37:00	Just fixed my gaming PC. Someone recommend me an awesome game with a great story.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-26 18:54:28	@NocturnalOwlie Winter mitts with little elephants on them.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-27 05:09:06	@NocturnalOwlie Of course I do! What kind of horrible person doesn't like elephants?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-27 09:26:18	I can't decide whether I'm enjoying or utterly hating Assassin's Creed 4.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-28 12:23:56	True Detective on HBO is possibly the best show I've seen in years.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-29 05:38:17	Should I read Mockingjay? I'm kind of in a YA mood and haven't finished the series. I've heard less than good things about it though...
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-01-29 12:23:16	@evileagles_"Gathering all her courage, Alexandra ventured into the dark cave where the thing from her dreams waited."
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-02-05 17:37:44	@NocturnalOwlie That's honestly the least interesting thing about it, IMO. I loved it more for the characters and the acting.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-02-06 00:56:42	@MissStrawberrii This looks beautiful.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-02-07 18:46:55	@NocturnalOwlie Oh god. 90sssssssssss
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-02-08 17:16:35	@NocturnalOwlie Have you ever watched Phantom in the Paradise? It's a crazy musical in the same vein as RHPS. I like it better.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-02-08 17:17:19	@NocturnalOwlie And of course I meant Phantom *of the Paradise. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-02-08 17:29:02	@MissStrawberrii Happy birthday yo
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-02-09 16:48:04	Just remembered that when I was 11 years old, I tried to adapt Xenogears into a school play.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-02-09 16:49:38	I remember casting my friend, a cute black girl named Lisa, as Elly and my other friend, a Puerto Rican kid named Jose, as Fei.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-02-09 16:50:25	And I made the Gear armour from carton boxes,
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-02-09 16:54:03	I think we got as far as the Lahan attack, which just makes for a terribly depressing ending.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-02-09 16:59:50	@NocturnalOwlie Well, we did end up looking like cartoons regardless. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-02-13 19:07:12	@NocturnalOwlie I liked it when Leonardo DiCaprio started screaming incoherently.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-02-14 02:05:06	What if Bayonetta was actually Jared Leto?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-02-14 18:45:38	The way my hair is greying is deeply disturbing. Black hair, black hair, black hair, stark white witch hair, black hair, black hair.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-02-20 23:37:54	@reiterasu If you do change your profession, will you randomly appear in fighting games like this fellow here? http://t.co/Ju0qNQCMqz
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-01 22:15:52	Albert Odyssey has the best world map music of any RPG. If you disagree then I will fight you. http://t.co/E5t51OsIU8
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-05 16:47:54	@NocturnalOwlie ... And deeper into the abyss she goes.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-04 16:41:39	@NocturnalOwlie That's like a theater full of people. Congrats, Owlie!

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-11 06:28:11	Ugh. Don't think I can wait that long for PC Dark Souls 2.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-13 15:52:24	@ian_snyder Hi there. Thanks for the follow!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-15 02:20:20	Telltale should make a Batman adventure/mystery game where you also play as Bruce Wayne.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-15 07:29:14	@sandkatt Which version of the game are you playing?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-13 02:10:57	@DrRoboturtle As a kid this scene kind of changed my life as far as videogame stories go. Was the first time a game got to me emotionally.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-17 16:07:20	Slowly crawling through Chapter I script of LINUS. It's taken me a week to write 4 lines of new dialogue. #fuckwritersblock
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-18 14:27:09	@Melaniipon It seems to be getting better. Managed to write quite a bit last night. Hope your BF gets over it soon too. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-19 02:09:41	Fuckers turned Kurt Cobain into a cyborg. #ProjectMorpheus http://t.co/5MIOMNgfwV
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-21 11:37:56	@NocturnalOwlie Fun stream last night!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-23 14:42:28	@reiterasu I agree completely. That UI is pure shit.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-23 16:03:45	@reiterasu What did you think of the art style?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-23 19:56:18	I keep on having dreams about this kid I knew in highschool who was crippled a few years ago. Creepy.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-26 16:37:26	Chekhov was right.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-03-28 07:16:19	Nothing's fine, I'm torn.  I'm all out of faith, this is how I feeeeeeel
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-04-01 00:28:36	Gonna try recording my first Let's Play soon. *is terrified*
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-04-02 20:12:04	Went up to the roof this morning and spent a few hours finishing All Our Wonder Unavenged.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-04-02 20:13:45	If you enjoy reading about the Canadian wilderness, I would recommend it.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-04-09 03:56:38	Reading Perdido Street Station. I'm strangely okay with the fact that one of the protagonists is a lady with a cockroach for a head.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-04-14 04:30:15	I'm not surprised that Joffrey isn't a fan of Sigur Ros.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-04-11 23:46:03	Just made some really terrible tacos. Why can't I be good at cooking? :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-04-16 05:03:45	Really New York? Snow?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-04-21 22:13:47	Radiant Historia is such a beautiful, underrated game.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-04-22 03:10:39	Speaking of underrated RPGs, Suikoden 2 still has some of the best sprites ever: http://t.co/iBaaNKBvWB
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-04-23 13:53:27	Went to sleep early last night around 11ish like a responsible adult. Proceeded to suffer through a gauntlet of nightmares. Lesson learned.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-04-27 04:30:14	Finished Arkham Origins earlier today. Hated how every Gotham City thug sounds like Joe Pesci in Home Alone.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-04-24 15:09:08	My desire to work on LINUS for the past month has been completely nonexistent. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-04-30 17:45:13	I drew this. http://t.co/87AQXtP1jw
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-02 07:12:03	I will never not be in love with Julie Doiron: http://t.co/pyAwlrXVmN
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-02 16:05:57	@NocturnalOwlie They have Mexican food in Finland? &gt;_&gt;
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-02 17:38:29	@reiterasu That really sucks. Hope things get better soon.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-02 19:47:49	'Saga' is such an incredible series. Just read most of it in like an hour.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-09 01:27:18	@Celianna_C Oh wow. Those look beautiful!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-07 00:02:49	Feeling a tingling of inspiration to work on my game again, but these episodes of Brideshead Revisited aren't going to watch themselves.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-12 12:26:25	@ZeroMark26 Cowboy Bebop is pretty great.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-11 04:21:24	That sound when you hit enemies in Cave Story is the most satisfying thing ever.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-13 19:37:32	Really wishing I could find an online server to play Risk of Rain on.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-16 18:49:21	@patrickklepek I demand a Bombin the AM with you and Alex sitting awkwardly in his living room.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-15 13:50:52	Had a dream that I stole a valuable materia (yes the FFVII crystal things) and had to make my getaway via hot air balloon.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-17 15:25:56	@reverendanthony @aedavis 'Feed Me, Humans!' or 'Feed Me Humans!' depending on what you can feed the monster.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-17 15:27:38	Guys. There is a race of sentient beaver people in Suikoden V. And one of them uses an electric guitar for a weapon...
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-16 01:48:03	Shake down, nineteen seventy nine
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-18 20:59:19	@NocturnalOwlie Be happy she didn't come back with someone's torso. &gt;_&gt;
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-18 21:00:58	@ZeroMark26 Gotta love that Bioware polish.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-23 14:32:39	Had an awful dream involving the finding of an awesome kebab cart, ordering, then waking up before I could eat.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-24 02:07:43	Will this storm be enough to nudge me out of writer's hibernation and start working on LINUS again? Probably not.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-29 19:50:33	Guys, don't eat food that's fallen on the floor. You'll regret it later.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-05-29 00:59:29	@diedrupo Weird. What book is this?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-01 19:36:03	@evileagles_ Wait, so, according to this comic, are people like Fumito Ueda and Hironobu Sakaguchi just... completely useless?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-06 06:42:43	@caraellison I bet he puts on a pair of converses whenever he's feeling like being a little crazy. Just a little though.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-10 00:08:43	@NocturnalOwlie Same. That trailer was weirdly emotionally resonant.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-10 02:51:13	@NocturnalOwlie There's always next year! *silently cries in the corner*
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-10 06:24:31	Goodnight nobody.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-25 22:59:44	Why do most badass female videogame characters have to look like they just came home from a rave and/or punk rock show?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-25 23:01:33	It kind of makes me think that the men who designed these women do so as a kind of fantasy-fulfillment. It's a bit creepy/weird.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-25 23:03:34	Girls shouldn't have to wear green military jackets and have purple hair to be seen as strong, independent characters. #justsayin
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-25 23:09:26	@Celianna_C Pretty much.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-25 23:16:02	@Celianna_C You just gave me a really awesome idea for a videogame. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-26 05:07:17	I really, really want to play FFXIV right now.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-26 17:10:26	@Melaniipon @evileagles_ The main character's outfit also changes at some point. But yeah, pure fanservice.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-25 01:40:08	@Melaniipon MATH PUZZLES
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-27 16:40:18	@Melaniipon Game looks familiar, but I can't place it. Is it... Dragon's Dogma?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-28 04:37:44	Am I the only person alive who doesn't give a shit about speedruns?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-28 06:57:35	@NocturnalOwlie But it's like- they're skipping through all of this amazing art and music that so many people put their hearts into.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-28 07:02:07	@NocturnalOwlie I am! I don't know, I'm guess I'm just weirdly obsessive about art and music.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-29 05:57:36	@NocturnalOwlie I miss your rpg let's plays! Was really enjoying seeing you bumble your way through Star Ocean and Xenogears. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-06-29 06:01:30	@evileagles_ I'm genuinely curious, is moving away and starting your own life when you're young not encouraged in Vietnamese culture?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-07-03 03:42:18	Had a horrifying dream that everything was covered in the number 5.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-07-03 03:43:16	There were 5s on my dog's fur, 5s on my wife's face, 5s on my hands...
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-07-05 21:11:23	Had a crazy idea for a game last night-- a real time strategy sim where you play as the ancient demonic force from a 90s-era console RPG.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-07-16 16:01:51	People who call things that are non-human sexy (i.e food, electronics) are fucking weird.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-07-19 03:10:43	@NikaHarper First read it as "Oreomancer" and became shamefully excited.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-07-21 22:23:26	Met some cool Danish ladies last night. We went bowling and ate fried chicken.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-08-04 21:16:18	There should be a word in English which means-- "The morose feeling of returning to your drab, shitty home after a grand holiday."
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-08-05 02:59:00	The Last of Us took a while to hook me in, but damn, I now understand why it's gotten so much praise. Super-expensive AAA gaming done right.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-08-10 20:14:08	My inspiration to work on LINUS has increased to a staggering 0.9% today.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-08-12 03:31:56	Wrote a couple of new scenes for LINUS tonight. One centers around divorce. The other is about a dragon.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-08-10 00:27:55	@evileagles_ Beautiful.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-08-13 04:36:18	@NocturnalOwlie Fuck I could go for some watermelon right now. :(

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-08-15 05:20:07	If you don't like sandwiches you are the devil.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-08-19 07:31:39	whatever happened to predictability the milkman the paperboy evening tv
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-08-17 16:04:34	@Archeia_Nessiah I'm getting a cool middle-eastern vibe from her. Was that intended? In any case, she looks awesome. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-08-22 04:32:32	I'm having a packet of gum for dinner. #laziness
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-08-25 16:32:01	Fixing bugs for LINUS demo release. Just drooled on myself.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-08-27 06:52:30	Combed through every major/minor character in LINUS. Females outnumber the dudes by a fair amount. I guess I like writing them better.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-08-30 17:20:35	@VinnyCaravella Congrats!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-02 06:48:11	this is how i design maps http://t.co/JajvlG8aTv
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-02 06:51:21	@diedrupo put the beds outside on the lawn. it'll be like they're camping.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-02 20:51:50	Finally finished the map from yesterday. Came out okay, I think. http://t.co/OYIdWumDcb
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-10 01:23:35	Nothing in a game will ever feel as awesome as 1-hit KOing a giant zombie with a phoenix down. #realtalk
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-16 11:58:38	Took a bouquet of roses on the subway. Felt awkward. http://t.co/WkSielJH6z
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-18 00:36:07	Sent latest build of LINUS to my battle system programmer. Hopefully we'll be able to have a demo out soon.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-18 00:39:51	Also, does anyone want to play Destiny with me? *crickets*
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-23 02:14:41	Someone in Chelsea really dislikes cops. http://t.co/bwR0d8Ch7J
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-25 00:43:35	@Celianna_C Oh fuck that thing. Burn down the shower curtain.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-25 00:46:37	I wonder if I could reenact the plot to Requiem For A Dream in the Sims 4.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-25 05:28:06	I think today I will wear my dragon t-shirt.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-25 05:53:56	I really hate it when writers go for disingenuous will they/won't they queerbait pairings. BE SINCERE WITH YOUR RELATIONSHIPS PLEASE THANKS
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-27 06:34:59	I met a cool rapper lady today. She gave me her CD and it made me remember that CDs exist.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-27 06:41:26	Also, does anyone remember the episode of Hey Arnold! where Arnold and Gerald ride a train and it takes them to hell?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-27 07:45:31	Will make a Hatoful Boyfriend clone where every character is your mom and dad and you must make them love you despite your terrible faults.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-09-29 05:05:54	@ZeroMark26 This sounds more terrifying than the original film.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-10-01 23:06:06	Things that terrify me: the words "post-surgical"
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-10-01 23:33:29	Maybe I'm actually a robot but I could never understand the concept of "loving to hate" something.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-10-06 17:31:50	@DanRyckert @dannyodwyer Intelligent Cube NEEDS to be revived
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-10-09 03:47:39	I don't know if he's wearing pants or not. http://t.co/nFPUuvnFb3
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-10-12 08:52:35	WASPinator was definitely the most entitled predacon. #beastwars
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-10-15 00:38:05	In horror games, the first thing people do when shit starts to go terribly wrong is start graffiting the walls with scary red paint.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-10-15 00:44:28	We need to move on from the creepy grafitti and random ominous voice recordings. It's getting a bit trite.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-10-15 08:02:08	Man, Legend of Korra got REALLY good after the second season.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-10-15 16:47:33	Fuck it. I'm making my magical academy game.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-10-15 18:04:57	@Celianna_C I'm really excited for it! I'm going for a create your own character kind of thing with a big cast. It's Mass Effect in Hogwarts
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-10-17 09:57:34	Planned on working on my new project tonight but ended up getting drunk and watching Sleeping Beauty instead
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-10-20 07:30:32	I can't believe it's been five years since I lost my favorite t-shirt.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-10-21 01:56:13	Oh god. My wife just informed me that the default male MC looks kind of like Harry Styles. Now I can't unsee it.. http://t.co/uTxkzEKjm0
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-10-22 04:54:16	The word 'Uterus' sounds like the name of an evil wizard from an 80s fantasy novel.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-01 08:45:41	Clocks in general are fucking terrifying.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-01 01:47:49	Bought lots of Halloween candy. No one knocks on our door. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-04 05:54:30	@NocturnalOwlie Oh god. How did it happen? Did you run them over or something?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-04 07:16:22	@NocturnalOwlie I had a dream once where this guy was trying to hurt my cat and I ended up disemboweling him with a pen. :/
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-04 07:20:23	@NocturnalOwlie Lesson learned. Don't try to fuck with Haru and Naru or else you're gonna get CUT. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-03 06:35:09	@kirkhamilton Misread this as 'Elite Beat Agents' and lost my breath there for a second.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-08 13:31:35	Bought a fancy Italian couch which looks completely odd and out of place but it's okay cause I can lounge on it with my shirt off
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-09 18:14:59	@ZeroMark26 This game is dumb.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-09 18:18:27	@ZeroMark26 Look at these dumb street names: http://t.co/ayBb0Z1q6V Fuck I wonder what happens at Lovecraft Lane
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-13 06:49:29	Every day is a reminder of every thing I've failed
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-14 01:37:06	I recently released a demo of LINUS, my RPG Maker project. Check it out yo: 
http://t.co/3Bbfp6QFLC #indiedev #rpgmaker
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-17 01:40:31	Writer: Thanks for hiring me! When can I start work on the game's script? Producer: What script? You're gonna write all these codex entries.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-15 14:35:27	@Archeia_Nessiah Oh my god yesss
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-15 16:14:57	Have a bunch of skulls and stuff strewn all over my floor. We put them up as Halloween decorations but I think I'll just leave them there.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-14 11:01:14	It's 6 am and all I want are tacos
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-14 11:17:37	Mike Tyson cosplaying as Zell from FFVIII should be the dream of all mankind.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-16 22:40:50	@ZeroMark26 what the hell is a rogue trader and why does it involve tentacle monsters?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-16 22:51:54	@ZeroMark26 Oh. I thought it was an online game, since you mentioned something about a bad microphone?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-24 11:57:56	Somehow I have injured my ribs by sleeping.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-24 15:40:03	@ZeroMark26 I'm glad your dog made it out okay. Pet surgeries are the most stressful thing.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-24 16:12:39	@RPGmakerweb Managed to create a pretty passable animation for a girl vomiting into a lake.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-24 17:00:17	@RPGmakerweb Well, not really. She was supposed to be summoning a nymph-like creature from the water. It ended up looking like... not that.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-24 17:01:41	@poisonmonkey1 @dannyodwyer So... dreamy,
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-24 02:34:51	Watching the entire run of Friends again. Rachel is still the best character.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-24 02:49:47	@NocturnalOwlie Chandler is too *obviously* funny. Rachel on the other hand is the true-dark-horse-best-Friends-character.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-24 15:44:13	Just found out a place nearby makes fish and chips fuck yes thank you roman snake god
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-25 14:46:54	This DM won't let me name my character 'Werewolf Shenanigan' and it's making me sad/upset.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-26 19:23:25	@IndraLadyPotato Just be genuine. I think people watch your streams because you give honest thoughts, not because of your rants.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-26 19:24:31	@IndraLadyPotato Although, it is pretty funny when you tear into shitty games. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-26 19:27:38	@ZeroMark26 What's with the knife and fork yo?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-26 21:07:51	Apparently 'sweetbreads' aren't sweet breads at all!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-30 18:54:25	That was dope.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-30 15:07:20	I was described last night as having a "blank stare" so now I'm consciously trying to stare at people super maliciously.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-30 16:10:02	I'm about to watch the original Star Wars trilogy for the first time and shall be liveblogging my viewing experience.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-30 16:39:36	@RPGmakerweb Yeah it's weird. I just never got around to watching them. I generally know what happens but I've never actually seen the films
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-30 16:49:13	Mark Hamill was a handsome bastard.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-30 16:54:32	I like how dirty and gritty everything is in comparison to the prequel trilogy. It makes everything seem real.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-30 16:56:58	Oh shit they have jean jackets
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-30 17:20:46	Jesus christ this movie got dark.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-11-29 13:49:14	I was drunk and pointed to a person and said "You. Me. Friends now." and I think we're supposed to go ice skating tonight but I'm not sure
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-01 00:29:40	Thinking about a game where you die and are reborn in an endless cycle of alternating female and male clones.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-02 15:25:39	All I want is to spend a week at the Gold Saucer I mean is that too much to ask
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-03 07:17:00	So weird seeing Miyavi become famous in America with this new film. Used to listen to him when I was 14. @_@
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-05 06:02:49	and then she threatened to cut my face if i said anything
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-05 06:07:01	that last tweet is the last line of my nanowrimo project, which i've just finished! yay
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-08 01:18:46	@IndraLadyPotato Love this game! Are you planning on playing through just one character's story or are you going to change it around?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-06 03:16:33	Yes. Just show ALL the environments.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-06 03:34:17	geoff keighley looks so dispirited :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-06 14:30:38	Feel absolutely devastated to hear about Nick Talbot's death. His music got me through some tough times. http://t.co/APpa3dk5DJ
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-08 23:27:20	I have vanilla wafers. I now consider myself happy.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-06 19:00:27	Troy Baker count: 2
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-06 19:26:29	holy fuck suikoden ! and II @_@
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-09 21:50:11	Just had the worst burrito. Shit was like half oregano and half salt. Ughuh
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-11 19:39:12	@melaniipon Your style is awesome! It actually reminds me of old Hannah Barbara cartoons like Johnny Quest. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-12 21:45:23	Have I mentioned how much I love this Xenogears vocal cover? http://t.co/k0VC3zUkvr
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-12 22:19:18	So am I the only one pronouncing xrd as "KSIRD" or what?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-13 07:38:57	@NocturnalOwlie Ha ha I remember you humming this while going on about Fei and Bart's romance :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-14 04:34:48	@jasonschreier This couple are playing through the series for the first time and have great commentary (up to II atm) http://t.co/UdaNqzO7PN
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-16 12:21:55	@ZeroMark26 You should rub your mustache on them. Stealthily.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-14 09:18:59	It's 4 AM and my hair looks really, really cool.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-15 02:50:47	@NocturnalOwlie Me too! But yeah, it's a crazy time investment, that game. Don't blame you for putting it aside. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-16 01:15:13	Went on a battleship. Took a picture of some giant guns. Was interesting. http://t.co/pP9eKYHY7b
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-16 18:48:33	@neverjessie As an American I always laugh at the phrase "fucking off to America", which has only ever been said about Piers Morgan
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-15 07:29:12	@NocturnalOwlie cool cyber blanket
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-15 09:29:12	It's 4 AM and I'm listening to "Little Motel" and I really wish I had fish n chips.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-17 07:54:00	@RPGmakerweb too much text (for a visual novel)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-17 18:11:30	@DanRyckert I think the band Xiu Xiu would be right up your alley Dan.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-17 18:16:07	@DanRyckert Seriously though you might like Tom Waits.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-17 18:30:22	I like the whole "Joan of Arc" vibe my DA:I character has going on. http://t.co/FBUo3bze72
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-19 21:55:16	Played some mount your friends with a few random folks and it was the weirdest most intimate experience
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-20 23:01:49	You know, I was thinking-- I wouldn't mind being possessed by a demon. I mean it sounds like it'd be kind of fun?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-21 00:16:58	The word "machucar" in Spanish is my favorite. It literally means "to crush" or "to hurt"
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-20 17:48:30	@NocturnalOwlie If you're a New Zealander and you don't care for the LotR films are you automatically shunned?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-22 16:03:48	I hate to say it but, I don't think Jonathan Nolan is that good of a writer. Just saw Interstellar and it was a bit of a mess. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-22 16:14:13	I mean he has brilliant conceptual ideas but the execution is a bit muddled. I felt the same way after watching TDKR.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-24 01:10:46	i drew this. http://t.co/4nrRVU2EvI
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-24 18:06:00	I have a strange attraction to women wearing fake mustaches.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-28 10:38:16	It's just come to my attention that I've been wearing the same shirt for like three days now
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-30 04:03:06	GET THAT SNITCH BRAP BRAP BRAP http://t.co/CnzuzGSCWq
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-30 04:05:41	Would be awesome if the song in the video I just linked to was about playing Quidditch, but no.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-30 05:26:23	Fuck it, time to watch all of the Harry Potter movies back to back
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-30 23:56:27	When I get sad, I make stained-glass windows.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2014-12-31 12:38:23	I would probably eat a mermaid if I was really hungry
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-01 18:59:28	@cazwolf @Zeigfried_Blue Happy birthday! And wow, right after New Year's too. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-01 01:39:48	Sad to hear about Ed Herrmann passing away. Richard Gilmore was seriously like the most warm, kindhearted dad on TV. #RIPEdwardHerrmann
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-01 01:40:52	*will now spend the rest of New Year's Eve binge watching Gilmore Girls*
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-02 23:20:26	@M4gicFe4ther Ugh fuck this. Happened to me last year and it's the worst.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-04 03:09:03	@diedrupo What's your novel about? And when do you think it'll be available?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-05 22:51:24	@AlexaRayC Beyond the Beyond
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-06 00:20:07	Wow. LINUS has been nominated for three end of year awards at RMN. Holy shit.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-06 00:46:57	@melaniipon Thanks! I've read the stuff on your blog and really like your writing too! Maybe one day we can collaborate on something :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-06 00:50:03	@melaniipon You had a tumblr with some of your writing on it, right? I remember!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-06 00:50:43	@melaniipon At least I think it was a tumblr...
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-04 16:51:46	@Oceans_Dream do you have a sub $3.50 reward tier cause if so I'd be all over that

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-04 17:07:46	@Oceans_Dream I think i've just found my next quirky indie game project. rock paper shotgun meet "nyc meatball sub subquest"
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-04 23:53:44	Watching the English dub of Attack on Titan and I'm pretty sure Spike Spiegel voices like 50% of the characters in it.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-04 18:05:47	@melaniipon it's both the most stressful yet most rewarding thing. when it sucks it really sucks, but when it goes well it's life-affirming
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-06 19:16:57	@melaniipon That looks really cool!  Love the antlers on the girl.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-05 08:48:08	It's 4 am, should be working on stuff but these trashy celebrity news blogs won't read themselves

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-08 02:21:49	@Oceans_Dream this sounds like the most complicated game ever
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-08 14:54:21	@VidarTheGame Fuck this weather. Seriously.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-09 19:21:19	The amount of times I think "I have no idea where I am" to myself is really worrying.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-09 23:34:00	@melaniipon @cazwolf I'm always down to chat with RM buddies
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-10 00:12:46	@Zeigfried_Blue I think the theme for your game jam should be 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air fan game'. What do you think?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-11 03:41:51	I should probably gain some weight if I want to be the strongest man on 163rd street

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-11 20:49:51	Crazy idea: What if they introduce Mario and Luigi's dad in the next Mario game?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-12 23:58:40	@NocturnalOwlie Just found this piece of art and thought you'd like it :p http://t.co/vlhcEYMH5K
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-13 04:46:36	Was playing some Assassin's Creed Unity and came across this hilarious glitch: http://t.co/dRUh3KExQ3
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-13 23:36:59	@MirageV_ Oh god. I remember this game. You played as a red-haired bishounen who summoned monsters and there were a bunch of hallways right?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-13 23:52:42	@MirageV_ I remember hearing this boss theme and being all "Nope. Too intense. *shuts off PS2*".  http://t.co/QPu9XHhtyK

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-15 22:20:57	Can anyone recommend good fiction that falls under the 'cosmic horror' genre (that isn't Lovecraft)? I'm looking for something more modern.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-17 17:50:10	@Oceans_Dream I'm uh... just asking for a friend but... is it possible to romance the dragon?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-17 17:53:17	@Oceans_Dream Missed opportunity. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-19 22:24:26	There should be more games that bring you pure, child-like joy when you play them.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-20 18:07:43	@DrRoboturtle That sucks to hear. Hope you feel better soon!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-21 15:44:37	@melaniipon art blog!

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-27 00:54:11	@NocturnalOwlie snow elitist!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-26 18:54:26	@Zeigfried_Blue Only in hopes of seeing McBacon Jam Part Deux :). Seriously, this event has been crazy awesome for us so far. Thanks for it!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-26 08:18:46	@melaniipon Have you ever thought about making a webcomic?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-28 20:31:04	@M4gicFe4ther Is this out in the West? Been wanting to try it out for what seems like forever.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-30 01:27:12	@JohnKrolik This sounds cool. Any recommendations? Been looking to get into EU stuff.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-30 01:42:35	@JohnKrolik Cool. Thanks a lot!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-30 03:14:46	@NocturnalOwlie I really need to play V. :(

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-30 18:43:03	You heard it here first
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-30 22:19:08	@M4gicFe4ther this game is so amazing and cinematic. Dat one cut scene near the beginning... :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-01-31 19:34:03	@d_jcs @benfowlkesMMA come on. You telling me that man wouldn't look dope in a fresh reebok tracksuit?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-02 18:51:09	If you're over at someone's place and they call refer to a Hot Pocket as a 'sandwich' that person isn't human.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-02 04:57:17	#LifeIsStrange is a really beautiful game,
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-03 16:06:34	Ya'll aint ready for that new Harper Lee joint
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-04 19:07:22	It's always weird looking up photos of old emo bands you used to listen to when you were 14 and finding out that the lead singer went bald.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-04 19:07:52	Like, what happened to your luscious locks?! :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-06 21:49:17	@ZeroMark26 have you never played this before? @_@
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-07 19:59:50	Yay i found a person who likes me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (don't say this in front of that person)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-08 12:59:31	@ZeroMark26 The accents in this game are a fucking disaster.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-09 16:47:05	This scene from Inside Llewyn Davis is still fucking hilarious. http://t.co/RpDwKbvQsJ
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-11 14:58:55	@NocturnalOwlie What about the one after that?!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-11 00:41:02	Tilda Swinton as Peter Parker.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-11 04:48:37	@Celianna_C Happy birthday Cel!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-13 01:02:51	I love how the pope randomly announces opinions and then expects the world to give a fuck,

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-17 06:12:36	@M4gicFe4ther Is this a new one?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-21 07:56:00	Les Revenants is so fucking good.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-23 09:27:09	i am going to steal ALL the cantaloupes
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-23 10:13:58	@NocturnalOwlie do you hate cantaloupes and want someone to steal them all so that you won't have to deal with them anymore?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-24 12:13:26	Random 7:00 am thought: why was there a horrible prison beneath the gold saucer? Did they ever explain that?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-23 02:29:10	why do I have all this glitter on me where was I last night
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-23 03:00:05	i would bite someone for some strawberries right now
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-23 04:56:23	@alex_navarro @bradshoemaker @MrPope alex enjoys professional wrestling. all his opinions are invalid.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-24 17:30:47	@NocturnalOwlie Oh right! I remember now. I guess my mind always blanks out that part of the game.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-24 17:32:40	@NocturnalOwlie It's terrible. One moment you're all "YAY  LET'S GO ON A DATE VINCENT!" and then you're stuck in a shitty prison. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-24 17:37:14	@NocturnalOwlie You mean you never took Vincent out on the gondola? It's pretty great. Him and Cloud just stare awkwardly at the fireworks.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-24 17:41:44	@NocturnalOwlie Oh wait. you're right! Wait, why do I remember Cloud and Vincent going on the gondola?! Maybe it was a fanfic or something.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-23 09:36:27	@NocturnalOwlie No. Because that would be impossible. The logistics alone...
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-23 10:16:27	@NocturnalOwlie does this terrify you? http://t.co/EQFsAZ8yJp
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-24 18:57:43	@shibashibamo are you typing in the middle of a blizzard? i don't understand!

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-23 16:41:29	@cazwolf Get out.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-25 04:32:14	@DystopianYA Please write this book.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-25 11:15:40	@CryWasTaken I think you'd really enjoy I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream. It's an old adventure/horror game.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-25 20:49:11	@patrickklepek you're heading down a dark path.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-25 14:22:22	@NocturnalOwlie Wait you fell asleep while playing/recording?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-25 05:55:46	my childhood is not canon.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-27 13:17:04	if anyone is sad i'll make them a burrito
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-27 13:45:37	@DystopianYA Jessup would be kind of hot if it wasn't for his slightly larger-than-normal nose.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-28 16:28:55	@benfowlkesMMA Congrats!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-02-28 19:24:30	california by edan lepucki is kind of slow and the two main characters are boring as fuck so far but i like its vision of the apocalypse
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-01 07:52:27	wow that gritty power rangers thing was really fucking stupid
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-05 16:24:27	@NocturnalOwlie that's awesome looking!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-06 14:21:22	@NocturnalOwlie Really? I didn't notice! Maybe because most of the music was like, western Disney singing.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-06 14:41:24	@NocturnalOwlie It's weird, but I had a feeling you'd think that game was cool. Maybe it's because all of the Scandinavianness of it. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-06 14:44:38	@NocturnalOwlie They should just make 'Inspired by ICO' a genre unto itself. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-06 19:40:54	One day I am going to built a sweet casino only the casino will be a front for the horrible prison beneath.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-06 03:21:06	@NocturnalOwlie like literally? Cause the mental image of you doing this is hilarious
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-08 02:13:31	wish i could take some time off work to just work on my projects :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-08 04:15:43	@AlexaRayC Some of the english VA comes off a bit awkward in the videos. How did you find it?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-07 23:57:17	@DystopianYA OH SHIII
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-10 13:52:27	@NocturnalOwlie Oh god for a second I thought that thing was like a crazy ancient tower and the cat was like a giant guardian sleeping on it
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-10 16:45:22	@benfowlkesMMA truly one of the unsung pioneers of the hallowed 'swing your opponent and slam them against the cage' technique.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-10 17:44:17	@NocturnalOwlie i think the show writers are going to ignore the books from now on and just make stuff up. which is cool!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-10 17:46:06	@NocturnalOwlie yeah instead the smug book readers will be the ones getting spoiled!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-10 03:49:45	@Oceans_Dream Don't you know? You have to sacrifice six rabbits to the circle and then input the konami code or else you fail.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-11 16:31:13	this game is beautiful. that is all. #OriAndTheBlindForest http://t.co/Olf1OaD0yF
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-11 16:38:28	@NocturnalOwlie it's a PC game that just came out. really beautiful and surprisingly heart-wrenching so far (and I'm only 10 minutes in!)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-11 16:39:21	@NocturnalOwlie it's like an adventure platformer. it kind of reminds me of that weird cat game you played a while ago :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-12 04:20:56	My old cat opened doors with her paws. My dog uses his face like some kind of fucking barbarian.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-16 01:31:48	if I were rich I'd just buy my friends cool gifts all the time in order to keep them from hating me. BUT I'M NOT SO URGHRH
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-16 20:45:37	That feeling when you're in a hospital waiting room and your phone's battery is at 9%
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-16 20:55:12	@NocturnalOwlie yes! A very boring one. http://t.co/7Aku8hbwIN
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-16 20:59:04	@NocturnalOwlie I mean I've been in some pretty exciting hospital waiting rooms but this isn't one of them!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-16 22:08:20	@NocturnalOwlie Well this afternoon I cut my hand open trying to open a bottle of wine but besides that I'm doing pretty good!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-16 22:08:55	@Celianna_C this is the absolute worst.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-15 16:37:38	@benfowlkesMMA I smell a CBS sitcom.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-19 04:29:55	oh and I meant I'm visiting MY parents, not other people's parents. That'd be super odd.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-23 21:37:33	@Zeigfried_Blue seems like you're going through a rough time. i hope things get better for you soon,
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-28 01:34:41	@ZeroMark26 I became a fan the instant they killed off my first two party members.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-30 17:38:54	@NocturnalOwlie there's baking and rain and bees?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-30 17:43:16	@NocturnalOwlie Oh god I love baking but I don't like people in general should I still watch
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-30 18:05:51	@Ecofonin @NocturnalOwlie I was sold before but... that table is really really nice. I should watch this show, if only for that table.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-30 18:16:26	@NocturnalOwlie @Ecofonin I like how old and used it looks. If this was Top Chef or something it'd be a super clean stainless steel thing
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-30 18:22:29	@NocturnalOwlie @Ecofonin What season does the tent make an appearance in? I want to see the tent!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-30 18:22:57	@NocturnalOwlie @Ecofonin But yeah I'll try to track down the 1st season and binge watch the whole thing.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-31 00:40:54	My new apartment building looks like an Egyptian tomb. http://t.co/OnrYX7HcDi
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-02 19:14:48	When I was little I used to read this book every night before going to bed. http://t.co/DtM3SKcQQR
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-02 19:21:13	At one point in it man gets his heart replaced by a clock. I think?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-31 14:18:13	@ZeroMark26 Spend an extra grand and we'll throw in these! http://t.co/YY6wWYLYOg
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-03-31 14:21:47	Help! I can't peel this orange. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-04 23:33:31	I went skateboarding today with a dog.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-04 11:13:36	I stole a carrot.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-03 02:38:50	I am obsessed with Steven Universe.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-08 19:54:04	had a dream that i was hanging out with a japanese dude and he taught me the proper way of giving a high five in japan
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-08 19:58:14	apparently in dream japan you just stand beside eachother and swing your arms back and forth with your hands slapping. also no eye contact
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-08 20:01:08	so it's not much of a high 5, which i'm fine with. i tend to miss like 60% of my high fives so i'm fine with replacing them.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-08 20:04:12	@diedrupo i agree 100%. am not at all interested in playing as a 90s grimdark gimmick come to life. also his name is Geralt, which is silly.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-08 22:35:24	fuck what you think HARRYXHERMIONE
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-08 22:36:07	seriously i'm rereading the books and anyone who thinks otherwise is just... wrong.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-07 13:39:21	"let me braid your hair" she said. "it'll be fun" she said.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-08 11:24:22	@evileagles_ are you including reboot?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-09 01:29:17	@NocturnalOwlie well, alright, i guess i can't deny the chemistry between oliver and harry at certain points, but still!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-09 01:32:30	@NocturnalOwlie i do think asexual!hermione makes a lot of sense though. besides harry. i dont think she had romantic chemistry with anyone
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-09 01:35:18	@NocturnalOwlie like i think she'd be way more into learning and being awesome than being interested in other people romantically. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-10 03:43:31	@NocturnalOwlie I'm skeptical. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-10 10:45:50	My neighborhood is so gloomy. http://t.co/gdVDWPqhaa
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-10 11:06:54	@NocturnalOwlie oh no! Should I be worried? You don't have a habit of randomly showing up and murdering your Twitter pals do you?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-10 03:08:08	Is it possible to restore one's passion and creativity after years and years of lazy apathy? I'm uh... asking for a friend.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-09 08:30:32	Whenever I hear the word "felony" I think of a cat wearing a cute little burglar's mask
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-09 08:47:54	Also, what the fuck http://t.co/N5rrffyBYj
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-11 14:49:06	god the art and world design in steven universe is fucking perfect http://t.co/O4tYyidBSO
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-11 14:53:04	i also love how they introduce inconsequential little details in earlier episodes that later on become important.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-09 18:35:20	Is Square Enix seriously announcing a new Star Ocean game? Those games haven't been good since 2.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 10:56:06	i only ever want children so that i could force them to wear ridiculous clothes.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 11:21:59	@NocturnalOwlie i would only teach them how to speak in a very thick unintelligible geordie accent and then send them off
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 11:23:13	@NocturnalOwlie basically they'd be like this (http://t.co/iZYWtyKbD3) but dressed like kanye west
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 11:25:27	@NocturnalOwlie i'm actually thinking of making something that's inspired by this :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 11:27:06	@NocturnalOwlie does new zealand have any creepy folk legends?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 11:27:24	@NocturnalOwlie i mean besides lord of the rings?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 12:22:11	@NocturnalOwlie i'm originally from spain but studied in the uk. been living in the states for six years.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 12:25:08	@NocturnalOwlie i don't really understand stereotypes at all :p. but yeah, why did you move to finland specifically?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 12:27:52	@NocturnalOwlie that's awesome! i don't know *anything* about finnish culture, only that they listen to heavy metal? is that a thing?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 12:28:12	@NocturnalOwlie or is that sweden? i'm not sure.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 12:31:58	@NocturnalOwlie i wanted to be a journalist and i thought it'd be cool to be based in nyc.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 12:33:41	@NocturnalOwlie who DOESN'T want to be rory gilmore? :p but yeah i kind of stopped giving a shit after a while, which is terrible.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 12:34:20	@NocturnalOwlie so then i became a nurse! did that for a few years, now i'm trying to make it as a tv writer person.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 12:36:37	@NocturnalOwlie yeah that could totally work out for you. i'm sure there's an audience out there for an anti-Pewdiepie. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 12:41:57	@NocturnalOwlie i don't remember actually. i just remember playing it as a child and thinking it was the most incredible mind-blowing thing
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 12:43:09	@NocturnalOwlie i didnt understand most of it though at the time, since i couldnt read english very well, but still :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 12:57:10	@NocturnalOwlie these were fucking cool! creation myths are just fascinating
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 13:40:50	oh these walls
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 16:44:41	@alex_navarro watch everyone do a complete 180 on this dude once suicide squad comes out.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 16:58:29	My dream profession? Cake judge
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 16:59:45	"This cake is good but it's not as good as that other cake"
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-13 17:00:06	I'd be really good at it
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-12 11:43:45	@cazwolf your eyes are terrifying
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-12 12:05:07	@cazwolf I meant terrifying in a cool badass way!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-14 12:38:44	Today I saw a person
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-15 11:09:25	@NocturnalOwlie this made me wonder how interesting it'd be if there was a 'ghost twitter' for dead people.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-15 11:40:52	@NocturnalOwlie i think gamergate already accounts for twitter hell
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-15 11:41:29	@NocturnalOwlie by the way! so are you finished with school now that you're done with your thesis? how does it work?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-17 18:58:25	Woke up late. Found this thing on my nightstand staring at me. http://t.co/k8VAGkBJo7
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-17 19:20:35	don't know where it came from but... i kind of want to sacrifice people to it.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-17 11:15:27	@ZeroMark26 just learn a good 3-string combo for each characyer and you'll be good (for story mode at least)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-18 00:35:41	Really want to make a game with Disney-inspired character design.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-20 22:34:33	@NocturnalOwlie it's true! i'm replaying it right now and his story is really well-written!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-20 22:35:33	@NocturnalOwlie like he's deeply flawed man who's done some terrible things, but he still manages to try and be a good person
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-20 22:36:24	@NocturnalOwlie and yeah i was just surprised by how much nuance the writers put into this side character that isn't a huge part of the plot
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-20 22:37:27	@NocturnalOwlie well, i guess i haven't really enjoyed the writing in most of them since IX-- XII and XIV excluded.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-20 22:39:14	@NocturnalOwlie 12 *and 14. I kind of dislike 10's cast and I think 13 is kind of terrible. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-20 22:40:33	@NocturnalOwlie I haven't actually! I thought the world design was the best part of 13 so maybe I'll like the sequels better.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-20 22:55:43	@NocturnalOwlie well, when I saw your first BOF3 video way back when, I 100% thought "HOLY SHIT SNOW'S JAPANESE VOICE ACTOR DOES LPS?!"
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-19 23:15:12	@NocturnalOwlie @SplitableInf best blind final fantasy lp ever.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-20 00:58:25	i should go off and exist somewhere

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-21 18:24:14	Me: I want to cancel my birthday party
Wife: okay.
Me: (this is why I married you)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-20 22:42:13	@NocturnalOwlie I did think Hope was the most realistically-written character. The bit with his dad was pretty cool
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-22 00:21:00	Its my 27th birthday and we're sitting at the laundromat watching basketball. I am content. http://t.co/6ZVr6bujIn
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-22 02:56:17	@NocturnalOwlie aw thanks! :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-23 17:26:16	@cazwolf i did this once and told people it was a crown
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-22 13:05:52	@cazwolf oh god this song was like my entire life when i was a teenager
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-22 17:43:03	@ZeroMark26 Whatever you do, don't choose the threaded cane.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-26 07:28:22	reading junji ito before bed is not one of the brightest ideas i've had
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-25 00:55:55	i'm really liking this new riff-raff inspired take on the joker
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-26 12:33:59	i think it's a fake mustache kind of day

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-28 04:08:47	Rented a cottage for the summer. Will be a long time gone.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-26 23:56:42	i left a delicious pie on my window sill and no one stole it :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-27 20:09:14	@ZeroMark26 This new album is really, really good. Wasn't expecting to like it as much as I have.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-30 17:41:04	@ZeroMark26 you've doomed us all by having a good day. hope you're happy!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-30 05:05:46	i went fishing on a boat today

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-04-30 23:54:44	@frailgesture Did these people leave their dog alone in the car? :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-02 20:02:39	Was looking up at my ceiling and hallucinated a massive fucking spider scurrying across it :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-02 20:49:22	@NocturnalOwlie I actually think spiders are kind of cool, it just caught me a bit off-guard. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-02 22:41:24	sometimes it's fun to be by yourself.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-02 22:41:55	i think one day i will move away and not tell anyone.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-04 17:27:05	@kirkhamilton Hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system,

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-06 03:12:34	@Celianna_C That's terrible to hear. I'm so sorry. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-07 14:53:44	@ZeroMark26 Was big on the Palpatine ticket until I found out his first name was 'Sheev" I mean what

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-14 12:28:48	@blueperiod_dev I've never heard of Kuroshitsuji. Sounds interesting!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-14 12:32:14	@NocturnalOwlie Is the manga/anime also a musical? Also, anywhere where I could see this online?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-14 13:04:09	@NocturnalOwlie Awesome! I've been looking to get back into songwriting again and needed some inspiration. Thanks for the recommendation. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-14 03:45:41	Twitter friends, what's your favorite musical?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-15 23:11:10	@ZeroMark26 Watch until the motorcycle scene then shut it off and go do something else that isn't shit.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-23 20:37:48	@NocturnalOwlie last year's had some pretty crazy acts, but I guess maybe those happened earlier?

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-23 21:04:22	@NocturnalOwlie don't they all get handed songs to sing by other songwriters?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-22 21:15:50	@StreamConNYC @nerdyorkcity @IAMLILBUB this cat is adorable but holy shit this is the stuff nightmares are made of.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-24 22:54:19	think I will make a serious attempt at learning how to speak Irish. such a cool language.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-26 17:19:34	Reading the last tweets of people who've passed away is both eerie and fascinating.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-26 18:26:48	Today I woke up on a bed of all my clothes.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-29 03:41:09	@NocturnalOwlie Oh wow! You're in for an incredible game. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-01 19:29:35	@evileagles_ man you really like xcom huh
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-05-31 23:27:24	@DanaSchwartzzz By moving to New Jersey!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-01 23:42:25	Listening to blink 182's magnum opus Adam's Song. Pondering that line about apple juice. Confused.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-01 05:09:22	@BenMoore035 If Hogger were there things would have gone differently.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-03 00:47:56	@PuccaNoodles such a badass drawing.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-03 03:41:10	@PuccaNoodles this makes me want a webcomic about a kickass ladies baseball team.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-03 06:26:26	@diedrupo I need to read this
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-03 14:16:15	So, Fallout 4 has the exact same premise as Fallout 3. Way to take chances!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-03 14:22:24	Also, what the fuck at not showing a female protagonist.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-03 14:59:40	@patrickklepek what am I staring at? I see nothing but a flat blue texture. you have low butt standards, klepek!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-03 18:14:53	@DanaSchwartzzz #SupernaturalRomanceYA DO IT.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-05 02:21:12	Gifs of babies falling and hurting themselves are pretty great.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-05 02:23:37	@NocturnalOwlie how else will they learn?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-05 04:11:07	I've fallen down a Wikipedia hole that I can't get out of
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-06 13:51:27	@NocturnalOwlie I'm awake and I found your weird FFXIV rambling super engaging!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-05 19:34:52	@NocturnalOwlie Have you watched Black Mirror? I think you'd like it!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-06 15:52:35	@Fobwashed @patrickklepek Pre-goatee rock god Patrick was best Patrick.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-06 23:43:11	There's a fruit stand near our building and my wife has taken to yelling at the vendor from our 3rd floor window asking if he has avocados.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-06 20:30:46	I'm 95% sure it's going to be a complete shitshow but I'm actually looking forward to this Shadowhunters show.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-07 01:19:10	This photo is great: http://t.co/M3BevWlm3L

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 05:26:15	If you sing Biz Markee's "Just A Friend" from the female's perspective it becomes a really empowering song.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 14:23:36	@NocturnalOwlie At least you don't have a horrible American/British/Spanish mixture of an accent that no one can ever place!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-09 05:14:43	@austin_walker sucks to hear this. Was looking forward to seeing King Renly again.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:04:11	@NocturnalOwlie how long has it been since you've been to nz?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:13:25	@NocturnalOwlie I'd love to go to NZ one day. I'm into quiet, solitary places. I also think sheep are pretty cool, so there's that.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:17:41	@NocturnalOwlie I think if I went I'd avoid the big touristy cities and just stick to smaller towns and the like.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:21:11	@NocturnalOwlie Is it weird to think of all of NZ as this beautiful, gorgeous place? Like are there crappy areas? I've never seen any!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:24:23	@NocturnalOwlie Hm. I don't know. House Architecture happens to be a massive, massive pet peeve of mine when visiting other countries.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:25:46	@NocturnalOwlie But yeah, NZ seems often. Am seriously thinking of heading down there next year. I'll let you know how it goes!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:26:04	@NocturnalOwlie urgh, *awesome
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:27:44	@NocturnalOwlie Finland and NZ are like, worlds apart then, I take it?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:31:11	@NocturnalOwlie I've never been to either, but I always felt NZ seemed really northern European to me. Has the same kind of stillness to it.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:31:32	@NocturnalOwlie If that makes sense? :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:42:01	@NocturnalOwlie I guess I meant more like, the natural landscape :p.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:43:01	@NocturnalOwlie by the way, are you like officially a Finnish citizen? Or are you on a student visa or something?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:44:25	@NocturnalOwlie Oh wow. That's cool. It took years for me become a citizen here. Had to get married and all that. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:47:21	@NocturnalOwlie Yeah, America is really fucking gung-ho about the people they let live here. I'm not even sure I *want* to live here. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:51:37	@NocturnalOwlie Do you prefer like, the country/rural side of things or would you rather live in a city?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:53:32	@NocturnalOwlie I was the exact same way. I'd love to live somewhere like, Cornwall or Nova Scotia or something. Quiet windy shores. &lt;3
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:55:28	@NocturnalOwlie From your LPs, I got the impression that you live in like shitty student housing with people who smoke all around you. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 19:58:23	@NocturnalOwlie It's weird for us. We live in a tiny apartment in the Bronx. There's millions of people around but we feel kinda isolated.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 20:00:56	@NocturnalOwlie Yeah. The Bronx is nice, despite the horror stories. Has a good sense of community but we tend to just stay in all day. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 20:01:50	@NocturnalOwlie That's cool. So do you plan on like, moving into a little house in the country or something? That'd be pretty amazing.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 20:09:16	@NocturnalOwlie The Bronx is the only NYC borough that's on the mainland, and we live way up in the north, so no water for us either. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 20:10:53	@NocturnalOwlie I think it'd be nice to live on a houseboat. I'm thinking I could build one some day and like, travel the coasts. :p
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-08 20:11:16	@NocturnalOwlie That's the dream, anyway. XD
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-09 23:53:46	Still one of the most incredible opening themes of any game: https://t.co/CuramVuRKp
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-10 00:08:31	@NocturnalOwlie Oh god imagine the lights dimming, this theme playing, and then... LAST GUARDIAN. :p

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-11 00:48:47	@SoozieCuzie I understood that reference.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-10 17:29:01	@Zeigfried_Blue not much! Currently taking a bit of a sabbatical from game development. Yourself?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-12 00:24:33	@helenacelle indeed! btw, if you don't mind me asking, what are your influences? also, any other musical projects besides this one?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-12 00:29:30	@Babylonian Stop ruining my suspension of disbelief.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-10 19:50:50	@Archeia_Nessiah @Celianna_C That looks beautiful. Loving the color palette!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-11 03:35:38	If I were a rad punkrock lady my stage name would be "PEGGY 18".

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-11 23:26:13	@helenacelle hi! just wanted to say that i think your music is beautiful and i'm really glad i came across your art. :)
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-11 23:34:40	@helenacelle I was listening to it all afternoon and just sorta disappeared into it. havent heard anything like that in a while.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-15 13:03:09	@ZeroMark26 Jaime Lannister was a ghost all along, he just didn't know it!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-14 15:54:58	@cazwolf I want to be friends with your brother.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-14 15:56:55	@NocturnalOwlie Seeing your name pop up on my feed makes me really want to play XIV again but I can't cause I'm too busy these days and UGHF
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-14 15:58:19	@cazwolf I'm picturing Ron Weasley. Is this too much to hope for?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-14 17:07:56	@NocturnalOwlie Was obsessed with it for a while but just didn't have the time to play it. :(

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-14 22:36:15	@M4gicFe4ther Does this game have any kind of good narrative? Am interested in checking it out.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-15 17:23:36	Good on Microsoft for having female developers on stage.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-15 18:02:45	@Archeia_Nessiah For some strange explainable reason I read this as "Yugioh breakfast is now legit with hololens" and lost it.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-15 17:06:50	This is the part of the press conference where I go off and play with my dog for a few minutes.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-15 17:11:06	Bullshit. New York is never that pretty in the winter.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-15 17:14:17	More shitty co-op acting!
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-15 17:14:48	Who talks like this while playing, seriously?
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-15 17:20:40	Tacoma is kind of a shitty town, sorry to say. :(
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-15 17:22:29	this game looks fucking dope. love the low-polygonal look.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-15 21:02:13	Literally took a nap during EA's press conference.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-16 02:03:19	Loved how they reimagined Midgar as a realistic multicultural city. Trailer reminded me of Blade Runner in a few spots.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-16 17:32:32	They better not spoil Realm Reborn.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-16 17:33:03	Also we need more games with giant trees in them.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-16 17:34:04	translator's gone off to get coffee it seems like.

1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-16 17:22:05	Nier was such an amazing, beautiful game with the most fucking awesome soundtrack.
1478371008	blueperiod_dev	2015-06-16 17:28:52	Picturing these dudes obsessing over the details of this Lara Croft model for years and years is kinda creepy.
