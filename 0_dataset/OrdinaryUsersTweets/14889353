14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-13 07:46:47	A shame @bg_ventures and @hublaunchpad have important events (19th) on same night at same time. Both need public sector influencers there
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-13 07:50:10	@KateAndrews @marcusfairs great thanks! My email is cassie@cassierobinson.net
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-13 08:15:54	Feeling necessarily reassured by Jonathan of @cyclefriendly for @techbikers ride. He definitely knows what he's talking about #phew
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-13 09:44:37	@yoditstanton @indy_johar we need to have coffee to start planning #datarichhub
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-13 09:55:58	@indy_johar @yoditstanton I'll coordinate.. (Owe you a few emails Yodit)
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-13 11:23:13	Today we're planning @WearableFutures 2 day conference @RavensbourneUK  What do you want to learn more about? What questions do you have?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-13 11:36:01	A Cyber Illusionist - http://t.co/fLOnVi5ZNy one for you @kieronkirkland
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-13 12:33:52	@honorharger which ones are they?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-13 16:05:12	When you're already feeling a bit sick and then you're confronted by London Fashion Week in your place of work, it never helps.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 08:43:17	I wish there were more public people who spoke up, held the uncomfortable mirrors up to us, cut through bullshit, like Russell Brand does.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 08:48:47	@AnnasQuestions looking forward to #scalingupimpact too and to seeing you!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 08:53:09	@EdWhiting1 oh wow, you're at Nesta now?! They are very lucky.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 09:02:13	@13theatre why it's often better to be comfortable in being a slight outsider. Cosy bubbles with blinkered people are suffocating anyway.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 09:11:24	@hannahnicklin I thought he was referring to everything as "other" &amp; with disdain in that article. But I'm not as sharp as you Hannah!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 09:17:29	@JemmaVenables saw this and thought of you @treehubproject http://t.co/RIRwgLruHT
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 09:45:29	The programme for the @epiconference starting on Monday looks awesome. Well done @ideasbazaar &amp; team. #epic2013
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 10:05:31	@ideasbazaar will we be able to access content if we're not going? And I'd love a coffee catch up with you too when you've recovered.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 11:03:23	@ideasbazaar great.. Will mail!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 11:09:29	@joesmithdesign if you don't like the word 'ecosystem', can you suggest an alternative? I think it's a v important way of seeing the world.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 11:30:45	@joesmithdesign that sounds very inhuman and rigid though. It means something very different I think.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 11:34:56	@joesmithdesign I would agree that it barely exists but I really hope it can exist &amp; so finding a way/word to talk about it is important.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 11:36:41	@joesmithdesign yup I know its meaning. For me it talks of how everything we all do has an impact on one another. We bury our heads to that.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 11:39:15	@joesmithdesign because I think it's how we can take more care of one another.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 11:45:56	@joesmithdesign I agree with that too! I've not said anything about building or designing. Just that we need a word for it cause it's import
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 13:27:35	@CMCW16 are you not in Singapore?!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 13:46:44	@EdWhiting1 thanks! I'm at Nesta all day on 20th if you are around for a drink end of day?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-17 08:48:24	@brokenbottleboy @Emmabarnett would love to tell you more about http://t.co/h2dFSIEcCW that we did @BarbicanCentre thanks @sharonodea
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-17 08:49:10	@Maurizio_Pilu are you going to be at the event on Friday?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-17 08:56:55	@pesska @KathleenStokes @LSECities I'd love to hear more too Kate
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-14 08:37:33	@dominiccampbell course! Just given it's all from same funders (50% is) you'd think they'd want public ¬£ to create a supportive ecosystem
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-16 08:43:08	@amandagore are you in our new Monday office? #wf2013
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-16 08:49:40	The new message in a bottle? Send your stuff in to space  http://t.co/r1rrZHrHeg

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-17 19:44:49	@solobasssteve http://t.co/3Tz1aS1NCw ‚ù§ (will stop enthusing now)
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-17 19:46:53	@dougald it was @termacora speaking highly and fondly of you
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-17 19:53:12	@kapow_katie I just saw you across the audience
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-17 19:55:29	@dougald @termacora @bjorkmananna I will once he is off the stage! We are all sitting down for dinner after
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-17 20:07:23	Very impressed by the design and vibe of this new space @termacora - will definitely be back to Lime Wharf http://t.co/BRqlopbv1T
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-17 20:44:25	@dougald @termacora hugged him!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-18 11:26:28	Good to hear your talk @neilgridley  would love to chat about your work at Philips in regards @makerversity &amp; @WearableFutures #MakingLondon
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-18 15:23:08	Not happy to find @GA_London haven't refunded the ¬£1k they owe me. Was meant to be in account in July. No phone no on their website either.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-17 21:03:58	@jonkingsbury @digi_si are @si_exchange involved in this project? #hopeso
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-17 21:06:36	@jonkingsbury Jon I don't understand SE London slang... What does that *mean*?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-17 21:08:18	@jonkingsbury ah yes, an abbreviation for naturally! ..
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-17 21:10:07	@jonkingsbury do you want me to take that last tweet down? üòÑ (Sorry it made me really chuckle)
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-17 21:12:58	@jonkingsbury I deleted it just in case! Hope to see you soon. You've got mail!

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-01 06:55:53	@AnnePBowers thanks for RT that Anne.. I think people shy away in discomfort so I'm always grateful for some support.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-01 06:57:52	@AnnePBowers especially when he was paid the money and pocketed it. Worst thing though is just completely ignoring someone cc @shrock
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-01 07:07:19	Hope your interviews with @indy_johar @merici @shelaghwright @simonpwillis go well today @sophiaparker #pointpeople #systemsinnovation

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-09-29 06:25:20	@umairh that's because it's an industry stuck in entrenched old power/influence/money. People aren't bold enough to disrupt the hierarchies

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-04 20:27:43	@THEALEXBOX hello! We'd love you to do a spotlight talk at http://t.co/pkloLABtPN - intersection of new technologies, design, style ...
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-05 17:37:49	@brainpicker do you ever do public speaking? I'd love to invite you over to London to tell the starting story for http://t.co/SuuKO0WF4Q
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 07:26:08	@marcventresca @zaidhassan does it include http://t.co/RDFug1ln0V? Was one of the 1st Labs (if not 1st) We set it up @thinkpublic in 2008.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 07:32:45	@scmurphy hello here! Hope your healing well. üö≤
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-05 08:35:02	@JayneHilditch thanks for the support.. after 9 months I actually got an email from him.. though it wasn't particularly reassuring.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-05 08:38:53	@JayneHilditch yes.. I started the process.. The thing is, I'm not sure he's actually got any money..
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-05 15:02:23	@_PHNX look forward to seeing the transformation of the studio when I'm in next week! Thanks for all your thinking yesterday.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-05 15:00:47	@rue_gabrielle lucky you!! Hope you are having fun over there
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-05 16:09:55	@roannedods hope today is going well..am trying to follow tweets!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 11:06:03	@marcventresca thanks, they are long gone but grew initiatives like @goodgym &amp; SILK is still going... I think that was 1st lab in local gov
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 11:10:02	@marcventresca I think @thinkpublic pioneered the movement of social design in public services (now adopted by many).. ..
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 07:20:29	@AnnasQuestions @louise_a @saltsea not part of it other than it being at @makerversity but will definitely be going. Great video @noelito!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 07:31:33	@marcventresca @zaidhassan &amp; http://t.co/DFx9LcIq2U  that @sophiaparker set up in 2007, v ahead of all Lab models trending in #localgov now
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 10:03:23	An interim write up of Enduring Love? study, asking questions about 21st Century couple relationships - http://t.co/UoNU9cdgHn
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 10:04:30	@zaidhassan @marcventresca that looks great &amp; sorry I was meaning from a design and public services perspective. Look forward to your book.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 10:08:37	@zaidhassan @marcventresca I agree .. And Labs are everywhere now so I look forward to reading how you've defined them!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 11:15:28	@marcventresca also, if you don't know @sophiaparker (another one of the Point People) I'll do intro.. She's much more knowledgable than me!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 12:37:09	@noelito do you and @AnnasQuestions know one another?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-07 07:12:37	It's Monday &amp; the perfect time to get tickets for @makerversity's party https://t.co/Tc19dxNBOa live music in the belly of @SomersetHouse
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-05 15:04:00	@_PHNX sugartits?! Love it. Think you should give us all nick names @makerversity
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-05 16:08:37	@MikePress @roannedods and increasingly competing with all their ex-students for pieces of work and undercutting them in terms of price?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-05 17:34:34	@roannedods aww, that is very kind. It was a very fruitful connection! It sounds like @thisismakeworks stole the show today üòä speak soon!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 07:37:32	@Simonablake @BrookCharity good luck Simon! Loved the Tshirt you were wearing for it in your Facebook pic.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 11:07:03	@marcventresca and @saltsea &amp; I still need to come visit you in Oxford. The @CriterionVent event wasn't the place for our chats!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 11:10:52	@marcventresca and @WeAreParticiple ( who've I've also worked with) are much more about systemic innovation of which design is a part
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 12:41:57	@MandaLeonJoyce you were in my dream last night.. Hope all is okay with you.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 13:30:33	@markofrespect my bike is still at Google Campus! My necks too bad still to ride :-/
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 14:18:50	@OpenSensorsIO what's the purpose of it?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 16:27:30	@markofrespect yes! My neck and right shoulder went numb after day 1 on ride.. I think from clutching breaks on downhills..
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 16:28:20	@markofrespect it totally seized up on Mon, Tues and Weds of this week! Hopefully I can get back on a üö≤ soon.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-06 16:29:09	@markofrespect was at the osteopath on Monday and Tuesday.. May go back!

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-12 13:49:33	@indy_johar I'd add nepotism to that list too
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-12 13:52:58	@indy_johar given the sector bangs on about social mobility, it's the one sector I'd expect less back door funding &amp; deals to happen ..
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-12 13:53:45	@indy_johar or the mighty and the "good" in the sector getting their kids, husbands and wives jobs and funding üòä

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-10-18 10:11:13	@inthecompanyof @i_futures  yes of course &amp; I'm just saying that in the design of many more let's think about how they feel welcome for all

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-03 19:15:21	One of speakers and #futures10 for @WearableFutures, @jamesbridle was on @bbc talking about politics and wearables..  http://t.co/uyYzkLOtJr
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-03 19:54:23	@TheCrated thanks for favouriting my last tweet &amp; making me aware of you! Would love to chat about our @WearableFutures ..who to contact?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-03 19:56:11	@sitdowncomedian yes I will be and thank you! It would be great to get @voguemagazine involved. Who's the journalist?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-03 19:58:08	@sitdowncomedian by the way, @amandagore &amp; I were saying how awesome you are on Friday :)
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-03 20:02:28	@sheseesred we can toast to her on Tuesday!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-03 20:04:48	@benhammersley someone at @100open may help like @rolandharwood as they work with Lego head office .. Let me know if you want email intro
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-01 13:49:09	@_PHNX @makerversity @JemmaVenables @danino it does!!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-01 14:59:51	Appalled by @enterprisecares Glasgow office for taking ¬£700 off my card without even telling me for "damage" done &amp; no manager available
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-01 15:01:27	@Redjotter remember me calling @enterprisecares Glasgow office when we set off on sat am to report damages already there? They've charged me
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-01 15:05:13	@enterprisecares I've just followed you. And first off I'd like the ¬£700 put back on my card that was taken from it without my permission.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-01 15:11:15	Sending me a DM asking to write you a detailed email is NOT customer care @enterprisecares .. Someone calling me directly, to help,would be.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-01 11:00:36	@_OpenP what are you doing here? #opg13 http://t.co/oO6QbICM4G

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-01 15:07:08	@enterprisecares I'm amazed you think it's okay to take someone's money without discussing with them the story behind it.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-01 15:16:47	@enterprisecares and if you bothered to follow me back I can give you my mobile number so somebody can call me. Thank you.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-03 21:58:22	@rolandharwood thanks for responding!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-03 23:32:23	@SarahGPerry but you gave her a skull as a gift too.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-03 23:37:10	@SarahGPerry it was and I hope we do so more and more #intimacy #lovethatdoesntbelonganywhere #Connectionthathasnoname (got carried away) xx

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-02 10:18:14	@edtparkes given that there were only a few tours booked in and the speakers corner was in such an open space I'm not what we have really
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-02 10:18:53	@edtparkes we will definitely be writing a blog post to go with the film we made for you though and will send that over to @JemmaVenables

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-02 12:35:34	Nice mention of @wikihouse from @_Beatrice ... I hadn't realised it had been created in response to an exhibition she was curating
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-02 12:39:24	I'm hoping the #futures10 (10 wearable responses by inventive minds) part of @WearableFutures will go on to have real consequences &amp; legacy
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-02 13:14:47	@sitdowncomedian no... ? What did it say?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-02 13:15:57	@sitdowncomedian will do.. And thanks. Give me a clue.. Is it good or bad?!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-02 14:50:54	@geniusjones that's a shame and will pass the love on to her. Lunch in London again soon?

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-11-12 08:37:43	@Se_Railway if you have "unusually large flows" of people have you considered that it might in fact be that you don't have enough trains on?

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-07 10:53:52	I'd like to do a chat show with @carriebish every morning #psicare
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-07 12:12:26	@municipalhero @DomPotter yes but think focus on individual is not always helpful because they're often in relationship with others #psicare
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-07 12:36:49	@ShahanaRamsden patient centred design (I'm a designer) hasn't worked enough on the units of relationships people live within.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-07 12:56:47	loved #psicare- thanks for having me @hublaunchpad @FutureGov @shirleyayres it's privilege to take part/contribute to something so important

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-07 16:59:34	@DomPotter @carriebish oh I don't  know,, I think we could capture the hearts and minds of many!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-08 16:49:10	@hollyjunesmith oh , I am sorry to be missing the whisky! Lovely to hang out with you all today.

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-11 10:18:29	it's never a case that what we wear is *just* what we wear, it holds codes. Lucky to have @ideasbazaar bringing anthro perspective to #WF13
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-11 10:23:05	A framework for wearables - you can listen live now to @ideasbazaar on the live stream http://t.co/0Y8IHUE9G1 #wf13

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 07:24:32	@HeidiHinder sorry to miss saying bye. Thanks very much for being part of it and I look forward to watching film of your talk.

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 10:53:45	@lilyashsakula aww, sorry were feeling poorly. If you are feeling well enough, it's my Christmas part this eve and you're v welcome.

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 12:18:21	@ZoePilger @SarahGPerry that's okay! I realised it was your event that night. Hope it went well! And come downstairs tonight if you fancy xx
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-11 10:30:38	Some questions from @ideasbazaar include, what is the role of clothing in the future? What will a new form of power dressing be? #wf13
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-11 10:31:47	Who can read who? What will data-driven or data-dripping clothes mean for us in a wearable future #wf13 great questions from @ideasbazaar
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-11 10:37:29	@M_Fkill lunch would be better if you will still be here?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-11 10:48:50	Wish there was a useful way to keep tabs on people that take up tickets at events,don't show, stop others from being able to get space #wf13
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-11 10:50:19	@lilyashsakula yes! Come! It would be great to see you!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-11 10:52:23	@rohan_21awake definitely! Love that idea. Hello @eventbrite .. We would love you to build a reputation system in to your platform
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 07:21:13	@carriebish the latest @FutureGov post has 'lived experience' in the first few paragraphs http://t.co/ij0lU6cWTk ask @emmagasson to define!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 07:22:51	@beinganddying thank you for coming and sorry not to chat more. Look forward to watching your talk and will intro you to Claire at NHS too

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-13 12:36:36	@ZoePilger @KayEngels @JenLexmond it was lovely to see you all. I look forward to hearing about your bus adventure too!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 17:29:49	@zoescope did you make it down to @makerversity ? Hope so!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 07:23:35	@_PHNX @HANNAH_MARSHALL that would be lovely! Lots of black.. I'll feel at home.

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 07:38:09	@sitdowncomedian @CMCW16  applause back at all your team! There's no way @amandagore &amp; I could have pulled that off without you all!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 07:40:16	@eventbrite would love to be updated on what your product team think. Any way of hearing from them. It's such an important idea I think.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 07:41:50	@smithonpurpose yes, we allowed for that, and we still had plenty of people. I was just surprised at who didn't turn up
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 07:42:31	@smithonpurpose and because we had to close the billings when we got full I was cross for those who missed out on a ticket
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 07:50:48	@stef you should build it in for sure but I hope @eventbrite does too. Sorry not to chat more yesterday and thanks for taking part
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 07:51:33	@M_Fkill sorry we never got to chat. Coffee/lunch in new year?

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 07:53:56	I hope @beinganddying &amp; @AliceOsborne got to chat @WearableFutures yesterday? If not I'll do an email intro #designfordeath
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 07:55:38	@benhammersley so sorry you made journey over to #wf13 &amp; we'd packed up. Thank you v much for coming though &amp; I'll send pics of The Eduino

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 07:57:01	@sacculi thanks Will and lovely to meet in person finally albeit briefly.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 07:57:48	@kieronkirkland thanks for coming and taking part. Still a bit sad you didn't bring a live animal though.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 07:59:04	@amalucky @amandagore thanks, we couldn't have done it without the support of @RavensbourneUK team. Good luck with http://t.co/ZG81kd3Zln !
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 08:05:01	@sitdowncomedian yup, know what you mean. @amandagore &amp; I literally couldn't walk down the stairs last night.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 08:18:04	@kieronkirkland ah! I'll look out for it when @amandagore &amp; I have our pj &amp; popcorn day, watching all the films!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 08:20:34	@sacculi yes for sure. I'll bd back in Rave in new year.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 08:22:21	@rufflemuffin people never understand when I say I'll never visit Australia but their politics suck and have done for years #backwards
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 08:26:15	Glad to see Australia is sticking with its liking &amp; singular ability for backward politics http://t.co/qSybS5Sa6N
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 08:34:04	@gracedent @IndyVoices brilliant article Grace, thanks for writing. Could you keep doing some more public things about this topic please! üêπ
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 08:35:35	@ruthkennedy and time... It takes a lot of time and people need to be patient for outcomes
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 08:58:03	Really looking forward to #reworkcities tomorrow designed by the brilliant (and lovely) @nikitaljohnson
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 09:14:12	@CMCW16 @amandagore still in bed &amp; in pjs but need to tidy room for tonight then take @francisbitonti on tour of Greenwich! See you tues üòä
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 09:17:21	@Acuity_Design I think the maker space was mostly empty because people were all in the talks. Lighting definitely needed to be better ...
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 09:18:05	@Acuity_Design and in the larger room we hadn't designed it for questions but I hope smaller room was more interactive?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 09:19:39	@Acuity_Design @M_Fkill there was calico to sew, 3d scanners and printers, modelling dough, paper/scissors -see pic http://t.co/9Zv3gIo3fc
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 09:20:33	@Acuity_Design no I didn't think you were.. We really want feedback. Lots of things could've been better. I was very sorry not to meet you!!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 09:27:27	@Acuity_Design I like a mixture &amp; I don't think the scale/design of this one was well suited to a lot of participation (intentionally)...
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 09:30:09	@Acuity_Design we'll do smaller, more participatory events going forward, now we've brought breadth of worlds together (first intention)
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 09:34:55	@Acuity_Design I think we felt it was most important to show breadth of what a wearable future could be before it gets too dominated by...
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 09:35:58	@Acuity_Design all the hype and tracking/monitoring stuff. Did you read context setting blog post? http://t.co/0Y8IHUE9G1
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 09:37:46	@Acuity_Design an opening of all the possibilities, incl the critical questions that need asking before it gets drowned by hype &amp; start-ups
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 09:39:32	@yvetteeady @amandagore @WearableFutures thanks lovely and look forward to seeing you this eve.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 09:46:54	@Acuity_Design sorry, it's this one http://t.co/cfvuRLI7bQ and let's meet in new year to see how we could combine some content etc?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 10:20:01	@Acuity_Design brilliant post and that's great to have the audience at #sxsw .. See you in 2014

14889353	CassieRobinson	2013-12-12 13:30:11	@KathleenStokes would love to be connected to @dfab_info if poss? And see you this eve!

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-01-13 22:24:37	Important to read @Adilabrar talking about @theamazingsuk after the big Facebook debate - http://t.co/If9jfoJcXI ‚Ä¶
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-01-13 22:52:08	@choosenick I think some of them did have something to do with the project. And some were posting more generally about 'failure'.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-01-13 22:52:42	@choosenick besides, we can't all have such razor sharp harmony as  you do Nick.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-01-14 11:37:57	@inthecompanyof talk to Cynthia at @kitchenetteLDN

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-01-14 13:37:33	#enduringlove addresses issues at the heart of public policy while also being close to people's hearts-much scope for how this can be useful
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-01-14 13:40:57	@growthfunders I'm interested in your model and how it could work for a 'crowd' of ventures all looking to achieve same impact...
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-01-14 13:48:39	@inthecompanyof not much new it?

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-01-14 14:01:52	Much more ¬£ is spent on health &amp; economic research, yet relationships are so important. Hope #enduringlove brings more profile to the area..
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-01-14 14:04:43	Wondering if anyone from @weareparticiple is at #enduringlove as imagine it crosses over with your thinking around http://t.co/b5jf2JdlPx
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-01-14 14:08:08	Carole Smart @MCRSociology talking sense about focus on how we do &amp; practice relationships rather than a focus on are you married/or not etc

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-17 07:54:10	@RobynScott @ChristianBausch looking forward to seeing you/hearing you at @tedxoxbridge today #TEDxOxbridge2014
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-17 08:29:53	@SarahGPerry best email of the day, an invite to your launch. The answer is YES.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-18 09:45:16	@ZoePilger I hope it isn't just the new wave of feminism that is coming to change that, but also "low culture" showing high culture to be..
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-18 09:46:39	@ZoePilger exclusive, irrelevant, lacking in edginess etc and not where the work of really talented and diverse artists want to exist (imho)
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-19 16:55:17	@rufflemuffin are you in London at the event I told you about?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-19 19:45:35	@protein thank you for having me and sorry I had to leave like that. Thanks to my fellow panellists too #futuresex
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-22 17:36:43	@saltsea @RachelmSinha @UniofOxford @mssophiaparker look forward to hearing how it all went #systemschangers

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-23 08:24:12	@UnwindingBlues @DNW1710 @Patrick_S_K @louise_a @atjuliaking @tom_corby1 lovely to see you all too #unbox2014
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-23 09:18:33	@bcaffin when are you leaving for SIX?I have 6 books for the conference that are stuck @makerversity ..
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-23 09:20:07	@DNW1710 I'm definitely guilty for over-ordering bread!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-23 21:06:39	@CherryParker well done! Brilliant news! Look forward to catching up after both our holidays.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-26 13:32:15	@giorgeor @adityadevsood @littlenemrut sounds great...plesae keep me posted. Giorgos, I owe you a long email! It's coming...
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-26 14:37:31	the thinking (&amp; doing) going on at http://t.co/DMB6IXnx9k (@TessyBritton/ @indy_johar &amp; @jeneralife's new work are both exemplar UK #psilabs
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-26 14:44:30	@dominiccampbell @indy_johar it's definitely longer term, but I think it sets up roots that are more resilient and genuinely disperses power
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-26 14:46:56	@saltsea then you could continue over to the west coast and visit me too!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-26 14:51:44	@dominiccampbell @indy_johar yes definitely, but personally I think it can be harder to do the longer term stuff..
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-26 13:35:52	@Lewwwk looking forward to catching up in Vancouver. Please can I buy you coffee and have a download of your reflections on  #psilabs?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-26 14:52:25	@dominiccampbell @indy_johar ---as things are generally set up to support short term wins across funding/policy/commissioning etc.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-26 14:55:26	@dominiccampbell @indy_johar well that would be a very interesting talk! #PSILabs
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-26 15:43:37	@AndreaSiodmok how much will @PolicyLabUK link/learn with @gdsteam?  #psilabs
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-28 13:05:29	@AlisonHarvie @Solve_Org  would love to chat to @longruncomms re the TV thing if you could do an intro? Thank you.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-28 13:17:18	Can you design for systems change? We're unsure but wanted to connect dots across areas of practice #systemschangers http://t.co/7qdmbcXgTY
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-28 13:58:48	sad to miss this http://t.co/mIZ9sfJLGz with people like @leisa @cityofsound &amp; @carladiana_ speaking..

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-28 16:21:50	Really sad to be missing start of #SIXVan14 due to transport issues but hope to get there in time for @FrancesWestley opening talk
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-29 15:49:12	@AliceOsborne - one for you? http://t.co/w3U5Gl7xbp
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-29 16:12:06	Diversity data from Google - http://t.co/04GsPUWXNA - painful but expected. I hope more orgs do this with their diversity data  h/t @merici
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-29 16:36:53	@Joerivds do you know @AnnasQuestions? she has new book coming out which I think you'd like &amp; is Director of @Forum4theFuture's Systems Lab

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-29 18:54:16	Loving this peer consultancy exercise at #SIXVan14 - feels like it enables more critical thinking than AL sets etc http://t.co/G5Hhzsc0TY
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-29 20:40:15	@volansamanda @volanschar your latest report/ work with KPMG is getting referenced here at #SIXVan14 on corporate social innovation
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-29 21:02:59	@marli_k I hadn't realised that was yours! Would love to chat with you about it whilst here #SIXVan14
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-29 21:08:52	@AliceMEvans I think it's the different versions of scale that can cause tension- depth vs breadth and the speed at which people expect it
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-29 21:13:47	@AliceMEvans yes! Will share a learning piece we did with @nesta_uk a few yrs back on innovation diffusion which covers this #SIXVan14
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-29 23:48:11	@si_exchange Be a platform rather than a tent! http://t.co/EzEeKOn4bL #SIXVan14

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-29 01:03:46	@dominiccampbell I think you might find it a bit hippy! üòÆ The #psilabs sounded awesome.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-29 01:09:31	#systemschange requires research, social participation, public/private partnerships &amp;to transform complexity in to simple actions #SIXVan14
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-29 01:10:12	@dominiccampbell I just know you are more of an action/practical man üòÉ
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-31 14:45:54	@SabineZetteler @lynsey_smith @lostvalues @Redjotter sounds good.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-30 15:41:20	Is there a reason we don't have mini aqua taxis/small passenger boats on the Thames? Love #vancouver transit options http://t.co/ixjgMOTJzS

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-30 18:04:44	@LydNicholas thanks, seems like women aren't very involved in that movement!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-30 18:14:34	#socialfrontiers I think these are e.gs of Marylin's theory being developed in practice http://t.co/SPKchaPwoI and http://t.co/gcII8oy0PK
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-30 02:24:13	#SIXVan14 participants, please take a look at http://t.co/MJdrXfI5gm for a whole range of personal &amp; thoughtful videos from #systemschangers
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-30 18:39:29	@helenedayfraser hopingyou know @dilyswilliams? You're both exploring similar questions around fashion &amp; social innovation #socialfrontiers
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-30 18:55:34	Research or re-search is a powerful tool to make us be less unconscious is a great reflection from @marli_k #socialfrontiers
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-30 18:57:14	@owenbarder @CGDev I think you should host the next one @makerversity
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-05-30 19:03:13	@owenbarder ha! Brilliant. Hope to see you for a coffee on the terrace.

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-06-02 17:20:17	@philipcolligan @PeterBaeck @cased it would be great to link this to the 'tech for good' online TV we're prototyping with @nesta_uk support

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-06-11 15:41:42	@graham_hitchen true, but they have slightly different agendas I would say, though I love them! Maybe it's how they link up better...
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-06-11 15:49:38	@graham_hitchen @RavensbourneUK I'm sure with people like you @jonkingsbury @jondrori around and staff like @CMCW16 that could happen!

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-06-14 11:38:49	@YvonneARoberts @janemartinson it's a good article,but I also have questions about who's designing &amp; delivering contemporary enough material

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-07 16:52:59	@re_dubhthaigh  always playing the role of asking the tough questions is @indy_johar
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-11 09:52:06	@rohan_21awake beautiful! My holiday in Cape Wrath a few December's ago was a favourite. Thank you for the fantastic copy of Native!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-11 10:44:23	@nraford @cottam @christianbason @cityofsound this is a discussion a group of us in London have been having. Where/how can we contribute?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-11 12:40:29	@nraford @cottam @christianbason @cityofsound an email list sounds like a good start! *waves* @graham_iff
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-10 17:23:42	@haideebelly &amp; @jonkingsbury seems I arrived a bit late for your leaving do! Sorry not to see you and wishing you all the luck. üçÄ

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-21 13:08:25	@rohan_21awake @VincentHorn hello nice fellow Birthday people! Are you down south any time soon RG?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-26 09:29:41	@annamaybank &amp; @thisismakeworks I've tried to intro you via SMS but trying here too.. You are both at YCombinator event.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-27 18:49:30	@thisiskyramaya one of my favourite poets ‚ù§Ô∏è (anne sexton)
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-30 09:11:14	@easyJet still in shock that, wether legal or not, you think it's okay to take people's money &amp; time &amp; overbook flights so we can't fly
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-30 09:14:52	@easyJet we've lost 16 hrs of time, spent ¬£700 &amp; missed our business meeting. cc @NatashaCarolan @olizilla - where is your accountability?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-30 09:16:09	@easyJet the thing that sickens me the most is our lives will go on but for some people holidays are hard to come by and money for them too
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-30 09:17:46	@easyJet and you think it's okay to play with people's money, time and lives like that? Your whole service is set up for privilege #noethics
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-30 09:45:40	@easyJet you could get your customer service to call me as I've been on hold for 15 minutes so far. I'd love some *actual* customer service
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-29 07:54:41	@Se_Railway do you think there's any chance you'll run on time one day? 5 consecutive days I've been late for meetings due to "congestion"
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-29 08:08:26	@Se_Railway Westcombe Park in to central London. There is always congestion at London Bridge and it means we always arrive at Charing X late
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-07-31 18:36:42	@DNW1710 @anabjain @louise_a .. Running late, sorry. Don't wait for me to order. I'll be 30 mins.

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-01 18:48:58	@CBM love that pic of @abby_super!

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-01 18:09:17	@noelito @benvickers_ any more meet ups or emails I can join?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-01 18:31:58	90,000 users so far @TalkLifeApp who are now working with @MIT on how  their data can be used in a predictive way to intervene #techforgood
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-01 20:13:54	@benvickers_ @noelito hooray! Thank you.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-03 15:01:04	In good company thinking future government with @cityofsound @nraford @giorgeor @pesska @skinnr @leashless @00alice http://t.co/3ZltbBnAOZ
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 06:30:30	@owenjarvis @TheKingsFund something that @thinkpublic pioneered about 8 years ago in a health setting with @nhsinstituteuk !
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 06:36:10	@owenjarvis yes but the best person to do that would @deborahszebeko @p_thurston or @ivoivo as they were core team for that work
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 06:37:46	@owenjarvis I'd be happy to come and talk about the work we've been doing with @MindCharity as very relevant re the federation model
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 06:39:13	@owenjarvis I'd also recommend getting @paoloperri in from @MindCharity as she has been leading a whole service design programme for them
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 07:25:44	Many good things on today including #ireality @LighthouseArts but I'm staying in London to hear @CivicSystemsLab stories #unusualsuspects
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 10:01:10	@DrEd101 @joostbeunderman other than the Hubs, do they have any other examples of these platforms?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 10:02:26	@DrEd101 @joostbeunderman what is the difference between systems thinking and platform thinking?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 13:19:44	Brilliant response from @TessyBritton when audience member asked about volunteering energy. These hybrid civic initiatives are not the same
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 13:22:43	You can't compare @transitiontowns, with the @CivicSystemsLab approach. The former wasn't working with an emergent, agency-giving process
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 13:41:46	@transitiontowns I think you do lots of great work! I just think what the @civicsystemslab is experimenting with is starting from diff point
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 15:54:52	@ImmyKaur I'm in black, big wooly jumper, hair tied back! I'm downstairs in Gerard bar at mo..
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 10:49:09	@SophiaLooney and also where the Council haven't already adopted a co-production, co-design, co-creation narrative, which Lambeth had done
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 10:50:38	@SophiaLooney if you are in Essex I think @CreativeCoop are doing some good work there
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 11:03:36	@SophiaLooney yes I think they are &amp; @CivicSystemsLab is a real exemplar set of works but in Lambeth I wondered how much that vibe ..
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 11:03:58	@SophiaLooney was already in the psyche of the community because of the Council bring a cooperative council
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 11:09:18	@SophiaLooney will be interesting to see &amp; how it needs to adapt for less densely populated areas, but I wholeheartedly believe in approach
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 11:13:03	@futurecitiescat please can I join your rounders team?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 11:33:46	@reinikainen Will be in the 1pm session.. then in the 4pm one, but have to pop back to @makerversity in between to set up #intimacylab
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-04 12:35:58	We still have a few spaces left at #intimacylab this afternoon..You can sign up here http://t.co/qdLvgboiYe @makerversity #3dprint #intimacy
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-03 17:07:45	@reinikainen nope, nothing to do with #unusualsuspects .. Organised by @nraford and UAE.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-03 17:10:17	@vtillz hello here, can't get on email at mo but just to say it will be with you by tomorrow AM
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-05 07:37:40	@inthecompanyof are you on your way to @makerversity ?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-05 09:35:08	This morning I was called Nessie by @rolandharwood and @AlisonHarvie was called Sarah.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-05 10:33:48	The @yearhere fellows meet naffly named "super connectors"hosted by #pointpeople thanks @rolandharwood @AlisonHarvie @juliahobsbawm @mitra_m
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-06 08:38:00	@saltsea are you back?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-06 08:49:45	@saltsea just sent you a DM!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-05 16:09:19	Our research plans for @webwewant #WebWeWantFest with @ejanderton #piecharts #webwehave http://t.co/N4dtpbqAs0
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-05 16:17:32	It's great to imagine the #webwewant but not without also starting from the point of #webwehave - the dark matter, the real matter
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-05 16:38:52	@gsvoss sorry to miss your talk today. Is there a way to see a copy? Your dress sounds like it went down well too!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-05 17:03:12	@ohrworm are you in @gdsteam on Monday for a coffee? Would love to hear about event!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-06 13:38:41	@joostbeunderman and @laurabunt too? As the commissioner of the work! #civic_economy
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-07 06:42:13	@rufflemuffin make poverty illegal just for the people living in Scotland? It feels like there is very little empathy from #yes voters
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-05 17:16:22	Thinking of @roannedods and hoping #imaginationfest is a brilliant success and that all of her hard work and strongly held vision pay off.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-05 17:19:16	@ZoePilger what did you say about sex Zoe? Would love to hear your talk/thoughts.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-07 07:24:48	Please could one of the British #50radicals start a new union debate not an independence debate? Thank you.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-07 08:25:24	@GerryHassan some of us as members of the public have though Gerry, and I don't see you creating much space for us in your debate.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-07 09:03:42	@rufflemuffin is it a political bike ride?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-07 09:14:32	"Radicalism is as British as tea &amp; cakes," by @geoffmulgan http://t.co/InFoUNJn8b but where's the radical thinking re the #indyref ?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-07 09:31:18	@tommetcalfe they are all about independence. I'm talking about radical thinking about what a new type of union could look like!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-07 09:32:03	@tommetcalfe they are only interested in a better vision for Scotland even though this is about more than Scotland.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-07 10:01:31	@ImmyKaur @Acuity_Design @John_A_Wade @shirleyayres @JayneHilditch don't let it Immy, celebrate it.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-07 10:03:00	@ImmyKaur @Acuity_Design @John_A_Wade @shirleyayres they'll always be backlash but this kind of media reaches new audience, that's important
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-06 14:47:26	@roannedods are any of #imaginationfest talks touching on topic of the people living in England(who are English) not getting chance to vote?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-05 21:52:20	@ZoePilger did you see my DM?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-06 18:30:05	@jamestplunkett they're an organisation full of talent &amp; have a clear set of principles that everyone believes in. Great leadership too.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-08 11:48:39	@indy_johar any examples?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-10 16:07:39	@jonfoster you made it?!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-08 20:21:40	@agpublic I think it's brilliant!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-11 08:11:08	@nd_kane &amp; @changeist hope you're both well. Please can you DM me your emails so we can invite you to something! Thank you.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-11 19:40:52	@leashless did I just see you at Westcombe Park?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-11 19:46:14	@leashless you living round there? It's my local station!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-11 21:36:49	@ValaAfshar @DomPotter they do if they work at the @the_young_fdn !
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-12 06:22:27	@re_dubhthaigh I'm in Dublin next week if you're around for a coffee?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-12 06:38:49	@GBoddington is there a chance of your presentation being emailed to me Ghislaine? That slide looks very helpful!

14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-16 15:37:55	The decision @rohan_21awake leaves us with is can we redesign rather than retreat? It doesn't need to be a duality #wisdom2europe
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-16 15:40:23	Devices that remind us we have a body &amp; interaction with tech as part of practice - some of @rohan_21awake nuggets of wisdom #wisdom2europe
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-16 16:16:36	@LucyGunatillake See you Friday evening in Glasgow?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-17 09:16:47	Loving Tania's talk at #wisdom2europe about social neuroscience. Blows apart all nudge/behaviour stuff-consciousness exists &amp; matters
14889353	CassieRobinson	2014-09-17 09:32:02	Tania Singer from Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences is one of the best speakers I've ever heard! #wisdom2europe

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-18 10:49:40	@commutiny @danmcquillan @reinikainen maybe it's just that I've seen the work close up &amp; know it's intention
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-18 10:55:04	@danmcquillan @CommonFutrs @commutiny @reinikainen maybe I take too much at face value! I'm blown away by what @CitizensAdvice do
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-18 13:22:29	@jocasebourne @cased @willperrin I'd love to see same transparency abut which individuals or consultancies funders work with too #data4good
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-18 13:29:14	Important to see where funders are replicating/repeating but as important to see funding that happens through social capital #data4good

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-17 13:58:04	@leisa sometimes I wonder whether all public service design agencies @weareparticiple @thinkpublic @wearesnook et al should share personas
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-17 13:59:22	@leisa those mentioned above &amp; @Innovation_Unit @Liveworkstudio @FutureGov etc must have 1000's after so many years, around key themes
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-17 14:00:29	@leisa although I do think there is a huge amount of value in creating new personas for each piece of work too. #userresearch #servicedesign
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-17 14:08:17	@eliotf what's up?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-17 14:09:54	@sustfash I'd say disuade. I think it is important to bring the political in as social innovation is political, but how you do that is key
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-18 10:30:38	@danmcquillan @CommonFutrs @stianwestlake @nesta_uk why so cynical? Have you seen what @laurabunt is doing there?

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-22 08:01:53	@anabjain I also think it's to do with the nature of a lot of work now and the pace of change.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-22 08:28:50	@anabjain  true, but I've seen 8 out of 15 Point People having children in last 3 yrs. It's pace of change that is so hard to fit back in to

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-22 08:54:57	@anabjain and those that were in jobs have found it almost impossible to go back to them for various reasons, some as you describe..

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-27 17:28:38	Ethnography is important for policy because it reshapes understanding of the world and how that understanding has been formed #openpolicy

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-27 18:43:14	Well done @lixindex @AndreaSiodmok @OpenPolicyUK &amp; team, it's pretty amazing to be sat in Whitehall having this type of convo #openpolicy
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-27 18:47:35	should we be so fixated on users? We can miss other intersection points &amp; only think about people as performing transactions #openpolicy
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-27 18:47:59	That was a final gem from @ideasbazaar and I couldn't agree more #openpolicy
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-27 18:54:53	@katjungnickel I had to run but hope to see you in the shop! It's 12-6 both days
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-27 18:55:12	@feraldata they are in the mail!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-27 13:45:49	@joesmithdesign yeah, got it now..it wasn't on the old one.

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-27 15:27:42	@radarqnet @noelito @laimikis thank you all for visiting...
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-27 23:09:00	@Redjotter look forward to hearing about who.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-26 16:55:05	@zararah I couldn't agree more..but isn't this event more about all the"cool critical people"rather than about those really creating change?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 08:24:28	@simonjgray @ImmyKaur I think we're hoping to do some workshops with #gov and #localgov to develop new #civicsigns
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 08:25:15	@ruthkennedy I just had a look and very similar!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 08:26:23	@AnnetteMees yes! Look forward to seeing you and hope to see you soon @solobasssteve
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 08:31:52	All the articles,projects,systems change, civic initiatives for cities are great, but what *is* going to happen to #rural #seasidetowns etc?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 08:35:41	I guess we leave them to wither away. "Dump"the people we don't want in our cities "over there" &amp; treat those places like we do our elderly
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 08:38:49	@solobasssteve thank you .. do let me know when you're here. X
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 08:49:33	Fascinating looking through twitter list of who the new @CivicDay is following to see a huge number of long established civic societies
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 08:51:39	@NewCitProj did you see that there is a new @CivicDay?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 08:55:09	@CivicDay it's something I'm keen to learn more about.Interested to see how it intersects with some of newer civic design/system change work
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 08:56:34	@CivicDay is there someone I can speak to/ email re our #civicshop plans etc? Many thanks.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 08:57:34	@annegalloway @objectsobjects yes please!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 09:14:10	@Redjotter comeeeee! üéàüéàüéàüéàüéà
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 09:37:51	@jasecoop if there's anything left there...
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 09:47:09	@jasecoop it might be but my concern is for all the people and their infrastructures that are being forgotten about outside of cities hype
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 09:47:59	@jasecoop wasn't really thinking of myself and my own escape plans etc!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 09:57:01	Btw @mssophiaparker, @ideasbazaar touched on #labs #design #ethno being used back in 2004 in #gov #localgov &amp; youwere a pioneer #openpolicy
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-02-28 12:36:08	@liz_buckley too much worry to think about Russian Visa's?

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-01 09:44:55	It's why I left it 11 yrs ago "it's a ridiculous &amp; pathetic parody of what it has been." http://t.co/jxls5jE8dC Li Edelkoort w @marcusfairs
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-01 09:52:48	@marcusfairs @edelkoort what about fact whole industry also survives on unpaid interns? Fashion + its poisonous culture been dying for yrs.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-01 10:00:12	@marcusfairs @edelkoort and I have to say, I really hope couture isn't the answer- that is even more removed from the reality of life.

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-04 06:42:03	Can porn empower women? The #WOWLDN debate only focused on the individual rather than the collective + lacked nuance http://t.co/ULTDNhAPaL
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-04 06:56:08	"The idea that feminist porn can make a dent in the industry is so naive." " I disagreed with her." http://t.co/K4vOMEFvIc

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-04 07:39:00	Surprised report still only uses language of vol sector + public sector + civil society as if nothing else inbetween  http://t.co/nd3ltm0vBH
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-04 07:47:24	@steve4good I thought it made some good &amp; valid points, I just felt it missed out a huge chunk of work that is about hybrid models
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-04 07:49:25	@steve4good &amp; also that it generally uses terms with no room for variation on there meaning, like"giving" only being about money for example
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-04 08:42:59	Liminal spaces &amp; liminal people are so important in change &amp; transition. Why do so many orgs still find that so hard to engage with?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-06 10:12:31	@Redjotter @MikePress unsurprisingly I see you're a sellout üôåüí™üëçüéà
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-04 08:52:38	@leisa I know .. And in some ways that's important, esp in public sector, but I think it can keep things stuck -"be the change" &amp; all that.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-04 09:02:47	@CommonFutrs @SimonFParker there is a festival of Utopia in London next Summer..

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-20 10:06:52	@JanetGunter because women's stories and provenance gets mostly drowned out by men and their egos
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-20 10:13:23	@JanetGunter &amp; I guess it's can also be what we give value to - the output rather than the facilitation for example
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-21 14:34:39	Thanks @Naomi_Turner for inviting #civicshop #census to be part of essay collection launched Monday http://t.co/zAMzpjYUMd #civicdesign

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-23 17:02:35	Design needs to focus as much on who isn't participating &amp; why, as it does on designing ways to participate #civicexclusion #designdemoc
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-23 19:12:39	Important reminder from @tom_watson re how few people inside Westminster understand digital + calls for us to help them #digitalcitizen

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-23 16:50:06	. @Mr_speaker_uk recognises design as essential for democracy, for designing in everyone's voice, designing better civic info #designdemoc

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-23 21:50:51	@sarahdrinkwater Oh that is good to hear, I had only looked at the winners &amp; thought they were just music &amp; fashion stuff. #eatmywords !
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-23 21:55:06	@sarahdrinkwater ;) think just having got back from #sxsw I'm even more on the look out for things that work for the 99% rather than the 1%!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-23 22:05:20	@carljackmiller loved your comments tonight. Could we interview you for @CivicRadio please? #DigitalCitizen

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-23 19:14:27	Another way of looking at it - " there's an earthquake bubbling up under Westminster" says @carljackmiller #digitalcitizen
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-23 19:19:57	How much do the public know re how Intelligence services work &amp;what kinds of data they need to keep us safe?@carljackmiller #digitalcitizen

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-24 08:28:21	@gquaggiotto thank you! I know quite a bit of the work in that list. Who do you think the audience is for it? Or the "user"?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-24 08:29:27	@AndreaSiodmok maybe if we finally get that coffee you can tell me more about the reasons. Thanks for the response!
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-24 10:23:00	@_lucapicardi just got them! Thank you.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-24 11:32:54	@genmon maybe @jonfoster is still in SF and heading back to London any day now?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-23 19:36:54	It's reassuring someone like @birgittaj is off to speak with1000 parliamentarians from 160 different countries next week re #digitalcitizen
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-23 19:39:08	@CommonFutrs hope your ears were burning today.. Talking about your brilliant data-for-public-good mind with @mikeymoo

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-24 07:58:14	Who does a really good job of drawing on speculative design but combining it with a less exclusive, more applied, and useful approach?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-03-24 08:02:15	@gquaggiotto @nraford we've met but maybe not chatted enough! I went to one of his group design sessions last year for the Museum.

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-04-02 08:13:31	Why is is that nobody seems to be able to explain to me how policy is made? Stupid question maybe, but does anyone out there have an answer?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-04-02 08:14:21	@zararah please could we interview you for @CivicRadio ?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-04-02 08:17:57	@tobias_revell that's great thank you, but I'd really love someone who describes their work as "policy making" to draw it out for me
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-04-02 08:25:19	@iamsamthomas I can imagine. I'm having ongoing conversations with @graham_iff about this and hope we can document our enquiry in some way

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-01 10:27:06	@operanomad how does what you're doing in terms of digital gov stuff link up with #ulabscot ? That would be a brilliant combination I think

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-05 20:49:44	Timely hearing Tony Marx, President of New York Public Library talk at #PDF15 -hope @Kathy_Settle + Libraries Taskforce can connect with him
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-05 20:51:24	Libraries are the main space for learning in civic society -  4 million people visit NY public libraries every year #pdf15
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-05 20:54:16	"Libraries are the most democratic of our learning &amp; information industries" Tony Marx sets out vision for #libraries of the future #pdf15

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-05 21:08:27	#blockchain experts @BrianForde (talking at #PDF15 ) - @SarahTGold @jessibaker - think its worth you all connecting.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-05 21:21:28	@jessibaker he's in NYC .. I'm at #PDF there.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-05 21:25:51	Love this quote from TS Eliot, thanks @johnpaulfarmer  at #pdf15 http://t.co/6iUq2QYO3a

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-09 16:13:02	@ImmyKaur read up on compersion in the world of polyamory. It's what taught me so much about jealousy.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-11 23:29:13	Building a #civiccommons - http://t.co/aV6aJx5KrT wish I was at @CivicHall this evening.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-11 23:38:08	What remains underdeveloped are frameworks by which to recognise,preserve &amp; perpetuate their civic value http://t.co/JWcFo4tSmQ  #libraries
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-11 11:08:28	@dansolo meet in Pennethornes?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-14 07:22:05	@SarahGPerry not sure I totally agree with that! You vote with your feet. They choose to be in the image surely?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-14 07:26:28	@SarahGPerry you're right, good point!Just when I worked in fashion many people were making choices that kept the system perpetuating itself
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-11 23:30:41	@danlatorre @MASNYC I'd add social innovation as another silo too.
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-11 23:31:39	5 highlights from SCL‚Äôs "Digital Landscapes: the future for libraries" cc @Kathy_Settle http://t.co/1phk3SeCqs #libraries

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-12 08:19:34	This reminded me of many of our chats over the years @rolandharwood @EllieHFord https://t.co/ifAXALzvu4 importance of #networks
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-14 07:27:19	@SarahGPerry and many models I met were from privileged and educated backgrounds who I'm pretty sure understood consequences
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-14 11:38:14	@johnpaulfarmer what is the best email to reach you on? I loved your talk at #pdf15 and wanted to connect to discuss UK context. Thanks!

14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-18 18:03:17	To read the #reclaimingagency report - http://t.co/RC8SY4vaPR - how can the Ad industry channel their talents toward social impact?
14889353	CassieRobinson	2015-06-18 18:11:18	A big gap in social innovation initiatives has been evidence of user value/demand = a huge potential for ad industry #reclaimingagency
