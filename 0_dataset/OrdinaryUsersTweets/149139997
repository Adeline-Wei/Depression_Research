149139997	blankheartstar	2011-01-14 16:19:33	#confessionhour it is soo much easier to love someone else than to truly love yourself
149139997	blankheartstar	2011-01-14 16:20:49	#confessionhour when people start too lose to me i freak out and then i act nuts so they'll leave me alone
149139997	blankheartstar	2011-01-14 16:21:28	#confessionhour i'm actually  really quite afraid of commitment
149139997	blankheartstar	2011-01-14 16:22:35	#confessionhour im afraid when things are going well for me because I am anticipating something really bad happening
149139997	blankheartstar	2011-01-14 16:23:18	#confessionhour im afraid God really thinks im full of shit

149139997	blankheartstar	2012-05-31 06:25:29	And just cause I'm not a size 2 doesn't mean I'm lazy nor does it give u permission to crack jokes about me being hungry all the time.
149139997	blankheartstar	2012-05-31 06:31:43	Not every overweight person sits at home all day and just eats shitty foods just like not every skinny person eats healthy foods &amp; works out
149139997	blankheartstar	2012-05-29 21:17:27	I'm happy that I can be completely fine without you
149139997	blankheartstar	2012-05-29 21:20:43	sometimes it is easier to blame someone else with all your unhappiness than it is to admit to oneself that you need to change
149139997	blankheartstar	2012-05-31 06:23:00	Ppl will say da wildest shit 2 u when youre fat. ATTN skinny ppl u r NO better than us just cuz sum1 is overweight doesnt give u r8 2 judge

149139997	blankheartstar	2012-05-29 23:00:56	it's funny how life works out sometimes
149139997	blankheartstar	2012-05-31 06:29:12	Since when is telling someone to starve themselves ever a viable option when someone is down about their weight? Really people?!
149139997	blankheartstar	2012-06-05 02:51:27	@Hot_LikeWasabi u right... i dont use the computer too much now...
149139997	blankheartstar	2012-07-13 11:05:39	Everytime I like a guy and it doesn't work out I just automatically swear off men but I realize that the right man is somewhere out there
149139997	blankheartstar	2012-07-13 11:08:46	I am determined to be happy today
149139997	blankheartstar	2012-07-13 11:10:27	Can't nobody make me happy and cant nobody make me sad.
149139997	blankheartstar	2012-07-13 11:11:34	The fact remains that I will believe in love
149139997	blankheartstar	2012-07-13 11:19:06	They say it happens when you least expect it. Might as well spend that time having the best time
149139997	blankheartstar	2012-07-13 02:55:47	As I look back at my tweets I realize that I just sound bitter. Need for life adjustment. Calling in reinforcements.
149139997	blankheartstar	2012-07-13 02:57:40	Even when shit doesn't go the way you want it youve still got to smile and be glad that you still have some happiness
149139997	blankheartstar	2012-10-01 20:05:55	With God all things are possible. So I am in need but I know that with him driving in my life it will all work out for the best.

149139997	blankheartstar	2012-10-21 18:37:30	There isn't a more beautiful moment than when a man can admit to you that he wants you and needs you

149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-20 03:18:56	I hate Declan though. He is probably going to ruin everything for everyone

149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-20 19:53:35	@cort_nayy Episode sixteen season one. Lmfao.... My wish was granted
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 00:36:44	My emotions are having some technical difficulties. Avoidance is greatly appreciated.
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 00:38:33	When you've stopped fighting you've stopped trying and you've given up
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 00:39:49	The only one I want to talk to doesn't want to hear it
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 00:40:46	You're turning into me and that's the worse fate to have my dear
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 02:40:57	Sometimes the best thing to do is to do nothing at all
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 02:41:36	Sometimes it only takes seconds to lose someone's trust
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 02:42:14	When there is no answer... That in itself is your answer
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 02:42:53	Sometimes you wish you didn't love so hard and other times you wish that you could
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 02:45:14	You systematically broke her, whittled her down to nothing and now you want her to pretend nothing happened? You must have lost your shit
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 02:49:26	When trying to get revenge make sure you dig two graves : one for your enemy and one for yourself.. Cause your likely to go down too
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 13:18:07	Can you stop? You're really starting to piss me off.
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 13:19:13	@MealyMealz More than 20 partners. To be more conservative around ten.
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 13:24:56	@MealyMealz Five is what everyone says but not everyone is so lucky. What happens after you've hit five and still haven't found "the one"?
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 13:27:32	@MealyMealz It is very easy 2 connect 2 more than 5 people in ur life &amp; sex isn't everything. It doesn't have 2 define u unless u let it.
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 13:30:36	@MealyMealz I respect that. I do however don't feel people should be stigmatized because they had sex with people You can't change your past
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 13:34:29	@MealyMealz u can only change ur future &amp; as long as u were safe &amp; don't have like 7 kids, I could care less. I'll let others respond now.
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 13:37:57	If that's what I told its a lie

149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 13:46:03	You make me want to be mean for no reason.

149139997	blankheartstar	2013-06-21 18:25:00	@cort_nayy @MealyMealz No yeah you are definitely right. I think having twenty different partners over like 40 years is okay but not 10 in 2

149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-12 12:32:19	Sure driving someone here to Walgreens uses up a whole gas tank
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-12 12:32:58	If y'all don't want to help me don't expect shit from me when I'm up
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-12 12:33:42	May I never go poor again in my life. People don't know how to act when they got more money than someone
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-12 12:35:44	Don't forget in life u will go through cycles good cycles &amp; bad cycles. Treat people the way u would like to be treated during ur bad cycle
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-12 12:37:27	Although I'm mad as hell about a lot of things that anger I am translating into positive things and it will get me closer to all my goals
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-12 12:39:15	My anger has motivated me to: 1. Save half my check so I can get a car 2. Workout 3. Work harder in school 3. Clean 4. Achieve my daily goal
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-12 23:59:00	I need more friends in ri
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-12 12:41:03	Money will make you realize who your real friends are and who your real friends aren't
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-12 12:43:16	There's no point in trying 2 stop someone from making a mistake Most times they just make it because u told them not 2 Cheers 2 the stubborn
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-13 21:31:44	@vitabellatmp I'll let you know by next Saturday!

149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-15 16:59:51	I'm thinking of buying a foreclosed home next year and renovating
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-15 17:59:22	Personally I would like a redo of the last 8 years of my life. I'd definitely be a different person all around!
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-15 20:20:59	I want to go out tonight!!!!!! Ugh! I need more friends!!!!!
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-15 21:47:36	I can't believe #CoryMonteith died! May his soul rest in peace!

149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-15 01:12:39	I'm hungry
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-16 03:04:26	I cannot. Getting drunk with my brother is an experience.

149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-17 15:18:02	Finding things in Newport is going to be harder than I expected. Merp. I'll figure it out though
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-17 19:34:30	I asked a woman at the blood center what to do in Newport, she thought for a moment &amp; said with a dead straight face "get drunk everywhere"
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-17 21:33:07	Yum I want a tall hunky man like Jonathan Scott.
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-18 14:21:30	The worst feeling in the world is feeling like you're replaceable. Nothing beats that except realizing you already have been replaced
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-18 14:21:42	I dance the pain away
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-18 14:23:11	I can even the drum and bass it's drowned out by the sound my heart makes- John Legend

149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-31 13:01:41	You are the love of my life, boy you're my reflection and all I see is you
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-31 04:35:38	Ugh to life right now
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-31 04:55:17	Perfection isn't real. Flaws are. You can work with flaws learn them and master. Perfection is an illusion. Don't be a fool.
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-07-31 13:02:49	It's better that we break, man my pandora shuffle this morning is bipolar.

149139997	blankheartstar	2013-08-06 16:41:39	My mom told me not to waste me life on terrible people so I am
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-08-08 23:14:34	Oh I'm staring at the mess I made
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-08-11 15:10:20	Sometimes my life is too real for me to be living it
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-08-12 06:04:02	Hands down the best concert I've ever been to #LEGENDSOFTHESUMMER

149139997	blankheartstar	2013-08-26 00:59:55	Everything about life is gross right now.
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-08-26 01:00:24	All I want do is sleep
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-08-26 01:04:43	Just cause I did something once that was wrong doesn't justify the millions of time you continuously choose to make the wrong decision
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-08-26 01:15:31	God please grant me patience
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-08-26 01:17:26	I'm so fucking angry right now. I've been stewing on this shit since yesterday.

149139997	blankheartstar	2013-11-03 05:27:50	I can't somehow I ended up in Foxwoods when I'm supposed to be going boston
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-11-07 16:16:37	That moment when you realize all you ever worked towards has gone to shit
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-11-07 16:16:57	Wishing leading to unhappiness
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-11-07 16:17:34	Every single day my life gets more and more disappointing
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-11-07 16:18:06	I don't want to be with anyone till I'm happy with myself alone
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-11-07 16:18:28	Having you in my life makes my life complicated

149139997	blankheartstar	2013-11-20 02:42:50	Betrayal suits you
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-11-20 02:43:24	Your betrayal tastes so sweet and is so decadent
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-11-20 02:45:40	Everyday you learn not to trust people, the people the closest to you sting you the most.

149139997	blankheartstar	2013-12-08 17:36:10	Don't compare yourself to others. No one has the same goals, the same dreams, or mindset like you.
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-12-08 17:36:40	If you must compare yourself compare where you are now to where you want to be

149139997	blankheartstar	2013-12-09 05:49:29	I used to think I was the luckiest girl in the world because I had some really great best friends -- and then a couple of them ditched me
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-12-09 05:50:37	Why is it so easy for people to just drop people out of their lives like they never even existed in the first place
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-12-09 05:51:42	I don't take friendships lightly. Acquaintances are one thing but my real friends, I chose you because you were special.
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-12-09 06:11:31	Letting go sucks
149139997	blankheartstar	2013-12-12 17:29:14	@I_am_SheRISE I'm trying to start writing again. I got you. I'll invite you up next time I do a poetry slam
