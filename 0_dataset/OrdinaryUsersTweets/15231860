15231860	WstowCycles	2013-02-22 11:10:51	Hello to all my new followers! I will hopefully have a workshop update for you over the weekend.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-02-22 11:14:04	@EatOrHeat I'm local and have a utility bike that I can use, or loan out if required. Need to be 6ft to ride it though...
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-02-20 13:39:08	@psimonk joke is, its £180 a year fully comp for a Honda Fireblade, but £700 for a Trek Madone and Stashe. All bikes have the same locks.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-02-20 16:10:11	@LOT107 really enjoyed ourselves, nice food and pleasant staff.  We will be back!  See you soon
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-02-20 18:01:09	@WoodStMarket Hey there, I'm not shop based but happy to meet to see if I can help out somehow.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-02-26 19:18:14	Broken my little toe. Good news is that I can still cycle, bad news is that it's scuppered my training for the Reading Half Marathon.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-02-24 17:47:10	It's by no means complete, but its a start. Will hopefully get some more done during the week. http://t.co/5MNpmZg1vn
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-02-26 20:24:59	@bikeuk Many thanks for the follow! Good seeing you at Core Bike the other day, what day are you at Icebike?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-02-27 06:47:35	@caymancycles the new Shimano shifters aren't much easier.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-02-27 14:53:21	@bikeuk unsure at the moment, will be either Tues or Weds so I'm bound to bump into one of you.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-02-25 20:24:13	First commute to and from my new place to work done. I now get to look at the Town Hall and the William Morris gallery twice a day!
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-02-28 10:22:30	@EatOrHeat Will try to attend on the 13th of April.  Am happy to loan a bike for deliveries, and do some deliverying myself.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-01 10:00:08	Just treated myself to a Thomson X4 Stem for the mountain bike. Very pretty piece of kit.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-06 20:48:28	Went tool shopping today, I've expensive taste and have just spent a small fortune on Park Tools. Only the best for Walthamstow cyclists.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-04 08:29:01	Today, the workshop project is to create some bike racking out of some old pallets, but first, it's time for some mountain biking!
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-04 13:01:31	Ride done, Epping Forest drying out nicely, still a massive mudfest in most places though.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-04 17:00:56	Recycled pallet. http://t.co/ZEOFALq0mw
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-09 18:20:29	Tonight I'm sorting out my spanners. This makes me incredibly happy.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-09 20:47:26	Spanners all in good order, I shall sleep well tonight  http://t.co/lPLyOEoHVn
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-09 21:45:31	@AlysinSane I haven't, does the Trinity Killer do horrid things with spanners by any chance?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-11 18:44:40	@maxjakob80 will have a rummage through my parts tomorrow. Need tyre and tube as well?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-07 22:52:43	Without fail, cycling home from Blackhorse Rd tube to my front door,  always makes me smile.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-12 13:44:05	@maxjakob80 I have a new QR hybrid wheel 700c x 25mm ouside to outside rim, Conti tyre and tube for £65 delivered.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-12 14:48:43	@maxjakob80 only 1.5mm difference each side, so a small brake adjust only. I'm a mobile mechanic so don't have a shop. Can deliver at 7pm
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-12 16:30:09	@maxjakob80 Just send me a direct message with address and phone number via twitter and I'll see you soon!
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-12 17:25:59	@maxjakob80 See you soon, I pass Blackhorse Tube about 7pm, so be with you soon after. Is a silver wheel ok? I have a black one for £75.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-12 19:25:39	@psimonk many, many thanks for your help getting me my first customer.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-12 19:28:38	@WalthamstowDad that's really cool, I did something similar out of old chainrings, but it looked crap.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-12 19:33:55	Tonight I'm checking out @TheChequersE17 Will be the first time I've been in there since 1998. I've heard it's slightly different now...
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-12 22:47:41	@psimonk I'll persuade you somehow... High Beach tea and cake on me if you fancy a mtb rideout sometime.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-13 10:35:13	@WalthamstowDad I did buy some gloves from them once, but have no business/work links with them.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-13 22:41:54	@bushell possibly, without having a look at it I can't tell. What make is the hub, and how old is it?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-14 08:28:27	@bushell Shimano grease goes hard over time, so most likely that clogged the shifting. Am happy to fix and get you back on the road.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-14 08:33:26	But how many cyclists injured? http://t.co/lof2PrEk81
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-03-14 09:11:24	I've now got a Facebook page! Search for Walthamstow Cycles, and boom, that's me!

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-04-12 06:25:24	@John_Ranson you'd think for £120k a week he would have hit the ball at the goal. I reckon he's got a holiday booked same day as the final.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-04-12 06:36:46	@JettaWillis I've booked you in for collection and return on Thursday the 18th of April. E-mail me your details and I'll see you next week.

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-04-11 20:13:51	@JettaWillis That would work for me. Can do same day turnaround on Thursday or collect Mon/tues for return Thursday.

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-04-28 17:12:09	@billtix No problem, it took me a little longer than expected to get it back to the workshop but it stayed in one piece.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-04-28 18:05:12	@edarcherthinks You put dog in front of husband, like your style.

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-05-21 05:54:47	@litildevil replace stem for one with a greater angle for more height.

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-10 10:55:13	@WalthamstowDad Not a problem, when would suit?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-10 11:16:18	@WalthamstowDad That works for me. E-mail me your contact details to WalthamstowCycles@Live.com and we can go from there.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-11 17:40:03	@nattyanwen22 Still want your bike collecting for service tonight?  If so give me a call before 730pm on 07790356470 to arrange.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-10 18:36:03	Like the idea of the two way cycle lanes down Brettenham and Carr Rd, but after using them both, found them dangerous.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-10 18:37:41	Heading into oncoming traffic on a road hardly wider than a single lane. Also riding on the left hand side, into parked traffic.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-10 18:38:19	Most cars are right hand drive. Drivers won't see a cyclist until half way out into the road.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-10 18:46:36	@Gerhard_Weiss it's just tighter, with 2 way streets there are a lot more escape options if someone does pull out.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-10 19:00:48	@Gerhard_Weiss just way too narrow for me. I'll be going via Penrhyn and Elphinstone if I'm in the area.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-10 19:01:24	@nattyanwen22 @ClaudeBinns it's £40 for the service inc pickup and return but excludes parts.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-10 19:35:08	@Gerhard_Weiss nail on the head. Safer routes less than 50m away yet encouraged to take Carr Rd and Brettenham Rd.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-10 19:37:13	@Gerhard_Weiss @wfcycling I would but new business, house and a full time job takes all time. Things hopefully changing soon.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-10 19:39:36	@ClaudeBinns ok cool @nattyanwen22 can you send me your contact details so  I can arrange collection and return walthamstowcycles@live.co.uk
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-15 08:38:01	Just had a report that parts are being stolen from bicycles at Westfield. No cameras trained on bike racks either. Watch out! Please RT
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-15 10:45:48	@GreavsieE17 @E17PubTrail @grelaarts @fabsternation @lady_stow @ClaudeBinns @Blackhorsestow1 I need to be let in on the plan.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-15 10:49:04	Drivetrain clean and inspected. Whilst this was degreasing, I checked the frame welds and cleaned. http://t.co/l0TZ0ykiiB
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-11 17:51:05	RT @tania_nexust: Any 'commie bike shops' (i.e. nonprofit recycling 2nd hand bikes) in E17? Somewhere like @BikeFoundry ? @wfcycling  ?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-13 10:29:49	Giant Rock open frame for sale in size M.Just had a major service with lots of new parts. Quick sale at £95 ovno #E17 http://t.co/LAia9JLL2Z
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-11 18:55:37	Teenage dreams so hard to beat. Am looking forward to the test ride http://t.co/asm0sDbitq
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-11 19:00:38	@nattyanwen22 No problem, I'm back in your area collecting Thursday if that's any use? if not same days next week works for me.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-13 11:54:13	@tania_nexust centre to top measures 19" I'm near Wood St but can be anywhere in Walthamstow pretty quick with the bike.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-13 12:06:42	@tania_nexust 21" is a big frame, how tall are you?  I reckon you need to be between 5'8 and 6ft for this one.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-13 12:10:30	@tania_nexust No worries, safe riding.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-14 13:40:45	Anyone come up with a decent pub crawl in #E17 yet?I'm thinking about a loop, starting Wood St, through Village, and then down to @Bell_E17
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-15 08:13:00	Can anyone recommend the best hairdresser in #walthamstow for my girlfriend? @katmilosc @car_e17 #e17
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-15 08:43:02	And the bike service begins, first I remove all the drivetrain for inspection and clean. http://t.co/gbT98UNY3s
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-15 08:50:59	@grelaarts @fabsternation @GreavsieE17 @lady_stow @ClaudeBinns @Blackhorsestow1 @E17PubTrail do we need to go to the pub and organise?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-15 09:24:35	@katmilosc @southendmir recommends @ClairehairE17
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-17 21:15:10	@ClaudeBinns how does collection Friday evening for return Sunday evening work for you?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-18 06:09:30	@ClaudeBinns best to send your intact details to walthamstowcycles@live.co.uk
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-18 09:03:58	@ClaudeBinns @nattyanwen22 Does 830pm work for both of you?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-18 09:14:10	@ClareLAllen @woodstcoffee Best of luck with the new venture, will pop in when I go record digging.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-18 10:32:52	@nattyanwen22 is there a time that suits you better on Friday evening?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-18 12:11:27	Old bikes don't die, they become toilet roll holders http://t.co/fcZeNANj1B
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-18 16:19:11	Anyone else get a dodgy tank of petrol from the @BPGlobalPetrol on the A406? Motorbike now running lumpy with no power.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-17 10:14:02	@LairyGodmother Sorting my website is on my to list, but fixing Walthamstows broken bikes is priority at the moment.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-17 10:25:16	@LairyGodmother I collect the bike, repair it, and then return.  I'm currently booking for collection on the evening of the 24th of June.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-17 11:30:46	Just in! Kenda Thorn resistant buggy/pushchair inner tubes, helps stop those pesky punctures. £15 each fitted at your home. #E17
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-16 21:31:01	@ClaudeBinns @nattyanwen22 did you both still want to book in for a service this week?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-18 10:57:19	@ClaudeBinns @nattyanwen22 Good joined up thinking.  Let me know if that works.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-18 14:23:02	@nattyanwen22 cool. Send contact details and address to WalthamstowCycles@Live.co.uk and I'll see you Friday.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-18 19:19:35	@joncrossley HELL YEAH!  What wheels do you have and how badly out of true are they?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-20 20:12:04	@ClaudeBinns @nattyanwen22 can you both send me contact and bike details /issues to WalthamstowCycles@Live.com
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-21 11:31:10	Hello again Twitter followers, sorry I've been away, I've been decorating the house instead of mending your poorly bikes.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-21 11:31:56	So, I'm back on it!  If you would like a bike service or repair I'm currently booking for Wednesday next week #E17
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-22 07:23:43	@ClaudeBinns morning! Just started work on the bike. Can you DM your e-mail address over so I can send the service report when I'm done?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-22 07:25:47	My workshop is starting to smell like a bike shop. I've been waiting for this moment for years.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-22 13:21:09	All repairs done for the day. Time to carpet the workshop.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-23 21:03:46	@cakesbykath Sorry to hear about your injury. I've been injured many times and it sucks. You can still go running though?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-23 09:41:19	@will_full I do.  I'm out collecting tonight for Wednesday returns around 730pm if that suits?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-23 11:03:01	@will_full I'm unable to let customers come to the workshop at the moment. I'm next out collecting on Wednesday evening if that works?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-23 11:12:49	@WheelBuilding What length you after?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-23 11:17:07	Good luck to everyone doing the Tour De Waltham Forest today!  Hope it stays dry and the wind goes away!
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-23 14:37:27	@will_full Cassette is £20, KMC Chain £16, and do you need chainset or just a couple of rings?  I'm collecting about 730pm tonight
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-23 14:40:56	@will_full FCM171 don't have replaceable rings from memory.  E-mail contact/address details inc phone no to WalthamstowCycles@Live.com
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-23 19:45:49	Me and my carpeted garage. And yes, that is a bar as well! http://t.co/Bc8If829Dv
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-26 21:08:06	@HelenCLondon unsure without seeing it, but i can give it a go. Is it possible to collect tomorrow morning?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-26 21:19:47	@HelenCLondon that can work. Unsure on price but as its relatively new I'm sure it shouldn't cost too much. Can collect at 830am?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-26 21:29:54	@HelenCLondon also send details to WalthamstowCycles@Live.com
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-26 21:35:20	@RGActive I've a customer who has a spare entry for the London Tri. Wants £95 (face value) for it. Any of your crew interested?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-24 16:35:37	Helped load Ship-My-Tri bike this morning, some awesome kit going to Ironman Austria http://t.co/AMGLvuP5tz
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-24 21:31:46	@HelenCLondon I can help! I'm out collecting Wednesday evening for return on Thursday evening if that's any use?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-24 21:40:40	@HelenCLondon no worries.  I am about on Thursday afternoon for repairs also if that helps?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-25 07:10:05	Walthamstow section of the A406 named as most polluted road in London  http://t.co/UGOoN3iH90
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-25 09:00:32	@WheelBuilding I've gone through all the boxes here @bikeandrun and we've nothing that matches.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-25 05:38:26	@HelenCLondon I'm a mobile mechanic. I collect, repair and return.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-25 05:40:53	@HelenCLondon I've also got a full time  day job along with Walthamstow Cycles. Got to be done sometimes. #skillstopaythebills
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-25 07:09:51	@RacerRosa Did you give the hairy legged mountain biker a dirty look outside the cinema yesterday about 7pm? :-)
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-27 11:17:07	15 miles of Singletrack out to High Beach, tea and bread pudding at Carl's tea hut before 15 miles of Singletrack home. Lovely.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-25 12:27:34	@RacerRosa Now worries.  Might have some news on what we were discussing the other day.  Will update you when I know more.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-26 06:16:57	@LairyGodmother I'm good at straightening them. I can also source parts. Can you tweet/mail a photo of the mech from the rear of the bike?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-26 06:18:30	@cheekyhandmades I'm mobile, so collect, repair and return. @katmilosc needs her sewing machines serviced so could perhaps link that in?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-27 18:55:46	Sweet dry Epping Forest. I've waited ages for you x http://t.co/sy4j0iTv3Q
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-27 19:45:45	Have had a cancellation for a service slot next week.  Who wants it? #E17
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-28 09:06:59	@bushell yes, the fixed threads can take a freewheel, but not the other way around.  Can I persuede you to ride a fixed over a singlespeed?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-28 11:20:59	@bushell Fixed are better (In my opinion) in traffic.  You can feel exactly what's happening with the rear wheel. Perfect on wet days.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-27 20:18:04	Sweet dry Epping Forest Singletrack now being ruined by rain. Glad I got out this morning.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-28 17:27:31	@HelenCLondon your new part is on my bag! Will fit as soon as I get back to the workshop tonight.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-28 19:23:52	@Hazza1970 this should give you an idea why the brakes were noisy. Before and after http://t.co/xWpTImCMjb
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-28 19:42:35	@Hazza1970 @AlexLesurf A good clean and a calliper reset has removed the howl. Just tested and did loads of stoppies and massive skids.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-28 21:16:48	@marklisseman @alishepster @ianstreet67 eseventeen bikes has now been closed for about 6 months. Shop premises being turned into flats.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-28 21:36:59	@marklisseman Can I be of assistance? I'm mobile bicycle collect/repair/return service.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-29 19:56:56	Enjoying a lovely relaxing pint @Bell_E17 after a hard day fixing Walthamstow's broken bikes. All donations welcome
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-29 06:38:47	@marklisseman I've got a blow torch, but that would destroy the paint. Am happy to give it a go. You tried soaking it with Coke?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-29 08:39:06	GOOD MORNING WALTHAMSTOW!
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-29 08:40:30	Anyone fancy a (medium paced) 3hr mountain bike around Epping tomorrow morning? 830am start up near the Waterworks? #E17
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-29 10:16:48	@LairyGodmother Best to mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com not restricted to 140 letters.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-30 11:55:39	Just had an amazing cappuccino @woodstcoffee a contender for the best coffee in Walthamstow. Highly recommended.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-02 20:42:45	@clairebradshaw that works for me, be with you about 730am. Can you email your address and phone number again?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-02 22:19:19	@clairebradshaw sorry, been to a gig. Will text you and head over for 730am
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-04 08:19:32	@meOMalley @psimonk although I do have a 2 mile figure of 8 from waterworks to hollow ponds if you want something short to get your eye in?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-04 12:10:33	@meOMalley @psimonk Just get out there and have some!  Forest is working really well at the moment.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-04 12:36:22	Just blew up my Fox Float 32 CTD's on the final section of singletrack coming home #expensive
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-04 17:27:03	@psimonk yes, Tuesday the 9th. Will have a chat with you about night rides then as well.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-04 19:56:17	This stretch from @sarah_osteopath is great for cyclists. Supple hip flexors = higher saddle and lower bars = POWER! http://t.co/wH75yhHFqF
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-03 21:52:19	@sarah_osteopath Hola Sarah! I'm just lining up some hoot suite praise for you!
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-04 20:04:47	Also, make sure you follow and use @sarah_osteopath for all your back problems in #E17. She's put me back together a few times!
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-04 23:08:37	@meOMalley out tonight but poss could drop one around tomorrow morning. Email walthamstowcycles@live.com with exact size and valve.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-04 07:33:59	I should be decorating, but I'm putting on my cycle kit for a sneaky ride.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-04 07:38:46	@tolu_tolu_ @tcolmccormack enjoy the art! That's my super talented mate @AlysinSane who designed my logo.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-04 08:14:01	@psimonk Epping Forest as usual. Had a great ride last week so am doing the same today. Fancy coming?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-04 08:14:51	@psimonk pick up on Tuesday morning for return Thursday evening suit?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-04 08:18:09	@meOMalley @psimonk I'm usually ducking and diving in and out of Singletrack so can't really describe a route.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-04 12:10:06	@psimonk I can sort that.  I'm collecting from Hoe Street at 930am so try and link that up? Will try and return the kids bike that evening.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-04 12:11:48	@cyclingalong Go for a blast, forest is in great condition considering what's been happening with the weather.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-06 09:03:25	Good Morning #E17 Who's cycling where this weekend?  I'm resting today ready to go tear the forest up tomorrow.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-06-30 17:19:56	Hello 200th follower @CakesAuraRosa they make amazing cakes by the looks of it. Worth a follow if you like pretty cakes in #e17
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-06 12:41:42	@stellacreasy There is definitely a lampost you could lock your bike to if you wanted to cycle.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-06 12:43:29	@stellacreasy Why don't you book it in for me to collect, repair and then return?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-06 12:46:21	@stellacreasy I know that feeling all to well!  Let me know when suits and I'll have a look in the diary.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-01 08:18:31	@TessGwen @stellacreasy are they sticking in bicycle lanes?  or just repainting?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-01 10:17:42	Rear mech snapped, went into wheel and then smashed the seat stay. No fixing this. http://t.co/0XPV62Jtfm
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-01 10:40:45	@John_Ranson nope! I service my bikes regularly to avoid this sort of problem!
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-01 11:25:14	@AlysinSane Time to stop paper cutting and come repair bikes with me.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-01 11:30:00	@John_Ranson Probably is mendable, at a price.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-07 14:06:45	@woodstcoffee @WoodStMarket that'd be myself with the lovely @katmilosc and @MichaelMcFry refuelling after a hard 25 mile ride
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-07 18:44:14	Sorting out @AlexLesurf @Hazza1970 disc  brake squeal using a blow torch.  http://t.co/RMIkOpnZEQ
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-08 11:03:39	@psimonk Still on for tomorrow?  If so can you mail me your address and contact details.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-02 11:08:15	@WinkworthE17 hey, how can I help?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-02 16:54:14	RT @SaffronKim: Feeling sad that this has all gone. RIP Eseventeen cycles http://t.co/c53x5Py64H
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-02 16:58:35	@SaffronKim same thing ;-)
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-02 16:59:16	@clairebradshaw in the area tomorrow collecting. Will check diary tomorrow to see if I can fit your bike in.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-02 17:00:47	@clairebradshaw what's the earliest I could collect tomorrow?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-08 17:53:29	@whatistime not a problem. I'm out collecting tomorrow for return on Thursday evening.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-08 18:12:50	@whatistime please send details to WalthamstowCycles@Live.com
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-09 06:41:14	I've just done perhaps my longest skid ever on my bike. Massively childish, but so much fun. Can hear my dad telling me off!
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-09 06:42:44	@HelenCLondon how's the bike and how did the ride go?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-09 11:12:35	@HelenCLondon That'd be the cables/new shifter internals bedding in. If gears go out of line again give me a call and I'll come and sort FOC
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-10 07:25:19	@E17Designers My pleasure. You've the oldest Sturmey Archer hub (manufactured in July 1956) I've ever seen, and perhaps the oldest in E17(?)
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-11 11:29:30	@roseandcrownpub we miss him too x
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-12 09:51:47	Wheel building this morning. #skillstopaythebills http://t.co/QQYSTj4pUv
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-14 11:20:48	Sunday morning ride done. Epping Forest is fast, dry and dusty. Managed to  crash within 2 minutes
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-12 15:45:07	Friday afternoon treats. Hello weekend! http://t.co/0n5JJgNcsw

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-12 15:52:07	@RacerRosa @WheelBuilding @_BLIXA_ @wfcycling riding there and back from Walthamstow yeah?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-13 08:58:43	Cycled up Ally Pally this morning and saw the start of the @redbulluk @redbullshop Soapbox Race. Track temp is HOT! http://t.co/T344rejyXk
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-12 19:27:43	@cakesbykath that looks like a great turnout! Say Hi to everyone for me
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-12 20:59:47	@woodstcoffee Sunday is about cycling and coffee
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-14 14:22:41	@caymancycles who's your money on for stage win?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-14 14:27:48	@caymancycles my money is on Quintana.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-14 14:34:14	That's what I like to see. The yellow jersey winning a stage. Ripping people's legs off on a mountain climb finish. Top riding from Frome.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-14 19:08:58	@meOMalley No one really good enough to challenge Frome this year. Having the Yellow Jersey win stages is great to watch.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-14 19:13:03	@WalthamstowDad I had a look at that, cool set of wheels.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-14 20:12:32	3 fantastic rides by 3 British riders today.  In no particular order: @chrisfroome @calcrutchlow @MichaelMcFry same again next week?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-14 20:28:29	@WalthamstowDad be seeing it in E17 soon?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-15 17:35:02	To those guys that shouted @katmilosc broken down car on Hale End Road.  Shouting at a stranded female is not on. Shame on you.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-15 21:12:38	Hello to new follower @estermcgeeney she owns the most battered Marin on the streets of London.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-15 21:42:02	@estermcgeeney really been that long? Many more years left in it yet.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-15 22:34:47	@estermcgeeney standing out from the crowd looking beautiful as always.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-16 07:20:16	Traffic jam and empty cycle lane. http://t.co/xwYdoN0nTn
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-16 07:43:38	Tuesday morning singletracking ruined by front wheel bearing failure 5 mins from home. At least it's only a 5 minute push home.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-16 08:03:41	@edarcherthinks @tomstaniford I would love to but my road bike is in bits and my MTB is broken. Dutch bike is working though...
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-16 08:18:20	@tomstaniford @edarcherthinks now that sounds like a good idea! What time? Parts to fix the road bike are on order.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-16 08:34:21	@tomstaniford @edarcherthinks Works for me, I'm doing lunch with my Mum at 1pm so can be there for about 3pm and the end of todays stage.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-16 08:52:35	@shaunwkeaveny definitely had an impact on my dog. She's walked off and is now in the garden barking at clouds.

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-18 08:07:21	Just got to Silverstone for the 2014 Trek launch, and it turns out F1 are tyre testing!
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-18 11:13:39	I'm at Silverstone today supposedly checking out the 2014 Trek range. Instead I'm watching these guys. http://t.co/JBYwBseDAE
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-17 19:59:30	@toolboxtan thank you very much! I needed a cheap compact bicycle storage solution.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-17 20:03:53	Hey new @ChequersE17 all the best for your 'opening under new management' night.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-17 20:13:57	@tomstaniford be seeing you at TrekWorld tomorrow? Could try and help blag that HT for you.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-18 12:19:12	Someone's crashed and red flagged it. Time for bicycles. Some project one frames; http://t.co/hHVG4QrjcX
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-21 19:10:33	Found in Springfield Park. Horse head crash helmet, can we get this back to its owner? Please RT http://t.co/GS0bulZ3nZ
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-18 20:25:03	@nattyanwen22 many thanks for sending David way.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-19 18:35:22	@WalthamstowDad that Saab has been relisted. Got to be worth a phonecall offering him a buy it now.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-19 21:17:01	@wheelscw do you have a photo and a frame number? I regularly scan most classified ads.

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-20 07:30:58	A t-shirt that I purchased in NYC in 2003 has had to be demoted to rag duty. Today is a sad day.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-20 09:55:43	@NormanLoves great idea! T-shirt now in the wash getting ready to be transformed into garage art.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-19 07:01:02	Feeling tired after a long day yesterday. Jumped on my bike and am feeling awake and alive. I love bikes me.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-19 07:02:18	Nothing to fast, just cruising along and slipping past the stationary traffic that's always on Forest Road every morning.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-19 10:11:09	@knee17 That's because I don't follow you... Send an e-mail to WalthamstowCycles@Live.com with your requirements.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-20 10:32:23	@tomstaniford I was there on Thursday for the UK dealer day. Ears are still ringing from the F1 cars.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-20 10:41:46	So, @Xfm are doing school sports day humiliation stories... @BBC6Music Steve Lamaq did this on Thursday.

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-22 18:49:23	Gah, just realised I've got my mobile phone number wrong on all my business cards!  Number if you need it is 07790356470
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-23 05:41:33	About to go mountain biking. The super dry forest now with a coating of rain should make everything slippery and more technical.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-23 10:31:31	Beautiful ride in a stormy Epping Forest this morning. Definitely a contender for 'best ride 2013' award.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-23 10:33:03	@EFMTB was a great ride. In places a little too unpredictable (got the bruises to prove!) I reckon this evening would be perfect for a blast
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-23 10:37:14	Stormy morning ride over Epping. http://t.co/NqTmbkZRi0
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-23 12:43:49	@WheelBuilding used Instagram to turn it into what you see.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-24 10:43:13	Just had confirmation that my new Rockshox Reveleation RCT3 have been despatched!
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-23 19:53:59	The numbness has worn off. I can now feel pain from the wounds that were inflicted whilst out on the mountain bike this morning ride.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-23 19:57:49	Left calf hurts the most. Rear wheel slipped and down I went. Most of the pain is coming from where my leg hair was ripped out.Photo anyone?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-23 19:58:41	Forearms are stinging as well due to all the brambles/nettles. Will go back to work tomorrow looking like I self harm in my spare time.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-23 19:59:43	And my knees a bit fat from where I came off and bashed the handlebar. This will really, really hurt tomorrow morning.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-24 13:57:14	They've arrived! Can't wait to get these fitted. http://t.co/JaDo9BLr64
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-25 11:47:43	Dear followers, say hello to @benstorey he's doing some mechanic work with me today. http://t.co/gozXxBwamI
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-25 12:12:01	Don't tweet @Benstorey that's not my mechanic (apologies for mentioning you BTW)! Say hello via @WstowCycles
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-23 20:23:34	@bushell I'm just a crasher. I've a spare MTB if you ever fancy a go.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-25 16:15:41	@WinkworthE17 not a problem, all returned. Will mail tomorrow.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-26 12:22:44	Finally had a spare 30mins to fit and carpark test my new Rockshox. First impressions are good, much better damping cartridge than 2013 Fox
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-26 12:55:48	@edarcherthinks you're hiring?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-27 12:28:47	Another wonderful 23 miles of dry Epping Forest single track done.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-27 20:35:09	I've been watching the Incredible Hulk for an hour, and there has only be one fight so far.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-27 20:45:16	Just had a fight scene. Awful. Walking away from this film.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-26 17:40:55	Having Ben here means I can do more repairs and servicing! My waiting list has now been reduced and I'm booking for early next week!
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-28 18:45:48	I've got 2 slots available for services this week, who wants them?

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-25 07:49:03	You can tell the schools have finished as Forest Road has flowing traffic along it.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-30 08:26:00	@fluffyduffy @AsheKellyDesign I'd have pressed charges AND got my bike back though.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-30 09:08:42	@edarcherthinks give it a rest
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-07-30 08:24:20	@AsheKellyDesign @fluffyduffy I helped a friend find a stolen bike the same way. Seller just handed it over as didn't want trouble.

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-08-01 08:41:32	@edarcherthinks Hey, you haven't sent the SENDirect tweet for over 48 hours, you feeling ok?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-08-01 14:15:53	@WheelBuilding big business at the moment I reckon considering the rise of the Cafe racer fashion.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-08-01 17:03:36	@WheelBuilding Why not, the basics are the same, probably just need to buy a slightly wider truing stand and some thicker spokes.

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-08-05 11:08:35	@ralphshotter Ralph, what sort of repair do you need? Tony
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-08-05 11:32:26	@ralphshotter Sounds like it needs a hub service.  I can collect the wheel tomorrow evening for return on Thursday if that suits?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-08-06 20:47:18	Loved to have been @leytonorientfc for tonight's win but was out collecting. Well done everyone involved, and best of luck to CoventryFC.

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-08-21 11:35:37	@Zassimo I might be able to do a same day turnaround on Thursday next week if that suits?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-08-21 14:16:43	@caymancycles perhaps you can get a cyclocross bike and a copy of Rouleur magazine to go with your Rapha pants?

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-13 11:26:49	@SkekBev as long as the cup is full everything is ok. It's when it's half-empty/half-full problems arise.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-13 17:58:45	@psimonk @dgoneill @GreavsieE17 @bushell We need to do something similar. @WalthamstowDad 's Saab down the Market/Forest Road/Ferry Lane?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-13 19:21:48	@WalthamstowDad @dgoneill @GreavsieE17 @psimonk @bushell did 47mph on a tandem down Ditchling Beacon. Stoker wasn't too happy.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-13 19:25:36	Epping rope swing. Great fun until you fall off. http://t.co/Ayjx7tkyq4
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-12 08:55:20	Mountain bike ready, Lycra on, caffeine levels at full. Epping here I come.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-12 11:48:52	Just found the best rope swing ever!
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-12 18:46:26	@dgoneill @psimonk @WalthamstowDad @GreavsieE17 Looks good, will watch later. Any of you been watching the C4 series Speed with Guy Martin?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-14 09:09:02	@psimonk @WalthamstowDad @dgoneill @GreavsieE17 @bushell Guy Martin program starts on 29/12/13. 1st episode about doing 110mph on a bicycle

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-14 12:12:09	@cakesbykath agree with you there. I also liked the buses/hgv with beeping indicators, but reminded me of this... http://t.co/x3AO3BeLBl
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-15 10:01:08	Chores this morning. Tidying the workshop and inspecting the tools for wear/damage.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-15 10:07:47	I am definitely cleaning the workshop @katmilosc I'm not dicking around with my motorbikes. This is essential maintenance.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-15 13:07:18	@E17woodstreet @WoodStMarktE17 don't forget to add Lancasters by the Station for a great selection of trees.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-18 20:13:40	Hey Walthamstow! The workshop won't be closing this Xmas, but I will be doing reduced hours. If you need any repairs doing let me know.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-18 20:53:19	Hello to all my latest followers, let me know if you need any cycle repairs. Workshop dog says hello too! http://t.co/HipxxOdwJl

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-16 10:41:23	@Reddingpower some proper double hard b*stard moves there.  Same again next year on please.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-19 08:15:59	First job of the day was getting this out. #stop #hammertime http://t.co/O1ZHuWHyjq
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-19 08:16:31	Just peaked out the garage window, looks like a nice morning for a bike ride.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-19 08:24:13	I've my mountain bike looking at me, wanting to go out for a ride. In 10 minutes I'll be deep n the Forest. I love living in Walthamstow.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-19 09:47:04	This photo was taken about 30ft from Forest Road E17 this morning. Great little blast out in the winter sun. http://t.co/4kxR5mVMQ3
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-19 11:39:32	@psimonk @LairyGodmother I would have liked some trail rakers this morning, although drifting was semi-fun at times.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-17 22:21:07	@SpannerBandit I've used it for swimming a reasonable amount. It's not hi-tech, but clean and does the job.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-21 10:52:52	Not sure about the genius on Barclay Road... I'm a mobile bicycle collection/repair/return service if that helps you at all?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-21 12:16:16	@wfcycling @AbSTraCtyarn Thought it might be Paul.  I also owe him a beer.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-22 12:55:45	@Lord_Meltdown it's crazy in here. We've just made it to the front after 40mins!
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-24 10:54:03	@maschmidtwit To be honest Matt, my speiling isn't exactly grate ;-)
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-23 20:02:04	@theRacingBear A service and wipe down exc parts is £40. I can collect on the 27th, return before New Year if that works?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-25 22:06:12	Must. Stop. Eating.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-23 20:34:01	@theRacingBear best to e-mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-22 13:13:35	@Lord_Meltdown thought that was you! When you clear the checkout you get the same elated feeling as finishing a marathon.

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-29 08:27:33	Beautiful morning for a ride. Swinley here I come!
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-29 16:46:19	@psimonk everything open! Great day, lots of grip and not a lot of mud.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-29 16:47:34	@dylantwe e-mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com and we can go from there.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-29 16:48:55	@psimonk am aiming on going at least once a month, will have to squeeze you in the car.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-27 10:04:19	I've made it through to the other side. Anyone need a broken bike fixing? Or a new one put together?

15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-27 18:56:59	Finally had a spare 30mins to resurrect a motorcycle project. It's been sitting under a cover for a year. http://t.co/iOQG7MleuS
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-30 21:13:30	@maschmidtwit is this on the Mavic Aksium on your Be-One?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-30 22:00:18	@maschmidtwit are they currently running true? Or are they all over the place (again)
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-01 11:11:35	Just signed up for the Reading Half Marathon. This year is going to be active, and it has to be injury free for a change.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-01 16:58:05	@TrekBikes will we be seeing the new CX bikes in Project One anytime soon?
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-30 22:05:22	@maschmidtwit best thing to do is just tighten it enough until it stops rattling! Can collect wheels on the 2nd of Jan for a tweak.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-01 21:11:37	Followers: don't forget today is a Bank Holiday. New Year resolutions only come into play on a working day. That's what I'm telling myself.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-01 21:18:42	Welcome to @ByggaBo . Looking forward to spring and all the Swedish stuff you bring. All the best for 2014!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-01 21:54:34	@ByggaBo certainly was! How's progress on the retail unit going?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-01 22:02:27	@ByggaBo sounds good! Where exactly is it?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-01 22:14:31	@ByggaBo I know the place. Nice location. We looked there as well but exhausting cycle shop already present.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-31 10:04:18	@EFMTB it sure is grim out there. I'm looping from waterworks to Hollow Ponds and back as it drains a bit quicker. Swinley is running great.
15231860	WstowCycles	2013-12-31 20:25:54	Happy New Year everyone! 2013 had been really kind to Walthamstow Cycles, will hopefully have a treat for you all in 2014! Have a good one!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-02 08:54:12	.@meOMalley @ByggaBo @clairebradshaw I've something in the pipeline at the moment, hopefully have some news soon.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-02 09:34:30	.@ByggaBo @meOMalley @clairebradshaw Early days so want to make sure it goes ahead.  Don't want to hype something that might not happen!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-02 12:57:25	@TheSausagesmith I do, but I wouldn't offer you a lot for it! I'd need  to service it, put a warranty on it, and make profit. eBay is best.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-02 13:15:19	@TheSausagesmith That's the sort of price I'd be trying to get for it after I've done the work to it.  I won't insult you with an offer.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-03 10:30:34	@Katmilosc RT @AlysinSane: Am drinking decaf tea. URGH, WHAT'S THE POINT?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-05 09:34:38	@ByggaBo @katmilosc oh yes, along with 'The Killing' fan tour and some modern art galleries thrown in.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-05 11:29:05	@RebeccaJade @Kerryupnorth @Blackhorsestow1 About 3 in record shops in @WoodStMarktE17
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-05 12:11:03	.@mjdataday Not a problem.  I've a helicoil set that can save the day/cranks! E-mail at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-05 13:37:58	So, we've been around for exactly one year tomorrow! How cool is that!  Some changes are coming, but would love to hear your suggestions.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 09:33:27	Car Drivers: For safety, I wear hi-viz clothing and have my lights on when it's raining.  Least you can do is turn your lights on.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 09:44:13	@eUs_brokendrum hell yeah! and indicate in good time, not just when they arrive at the turning you want!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 09:47:39	@bushell Haven't been around it yet to take a look.  Am wondering why it took so long just to raise the road 5 inches though...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 09:48:02	@bushell is it the part where the road now narrows?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 10:10:30	@bushell so Badliss is now 2-way for cyclists?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-05 14:29:47	.@IdoruKnits I do indeed service bicycles.  A service is £40 excluding parts. Price includes collection and return of the bicycle(s)
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-05 15:10:26	@Billtix any excuse for a pint...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-05 15:10:39	RT @toolboxtan: @WstowCycles well done I highly recommend your services! @toolboxtan
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-05 15:11:46	Not a bad idea, knock me one up for test. RT @LairyGodmother reckon you should do pick ups in special wstow cycles onesie.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-05 15:12:36	@Billtix probably used all your daily will power up by staying calm in Ikea.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 13:17:18	@bushell well I won't be riding up there anytime soon.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-07 08:23:42	@tom_webster I can supply. What size do you need and I'll check my stock room?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-07 08:30:53	@tom_webster no problem. Do you need the tubes to have 90 degree valves?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-07 09:26:51	@tom_webster Tyre and 90 degree tubes in stock. £30 all in.  Can deliver them tonight.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-07 09:30:26	@tom_webster Price is for 2 tyres and 2 inner tubes.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-07 09:34:29	@tom_webster best to e-mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.co.uk
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-07 09:57:42	@Rik_E17 Sounds dead... How many gears? and does it need to be drum/back pedal brake?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-07 10:09:46	@Rik_E17 you're looking at about £85 for the hub,then a wheel build at £25 if the old spokes can be used.If not then its £30 for a spoke set
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-07 10:10:52	@Rik_E17 I've got bearings and cotter pins in stock so I doubt this will be a big expense.  £4 for bearings, £1.50 a cotter pin + £15 to fit
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-07 10:12:07	@tom_webster Apologies. WalthamstowCycles@Live.COM getting my e-mail addresses muddled up this morning.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-07 10:27:38	@Rik_E17 Mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com to arrange a collection.  If all parts arrive on time then should be a week to turnaround.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-05 17:35:43	@chrisjwarburton @sniffpetrol have you seen the UK version of Breaking Bad? Teacher gets cancer and then receives treatment via the NHS.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 17:06:59	Anyone fancy an 11km run tonight? start at about 730pm from Whitefield School.  Aiming to be out for less than an hour.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-07 13:10:51	Just unboxing a Trek Project One Domane 6 with Dura Ace Di2. This is a really smart bit of kit.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-05 20:00:13	First change is that I'm extending my area.  I now collect and return from all of LBWF, Woodford, Woodford Green and Chingford.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-05 20:26:34	@Adams070369 maybe at a push...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-04 13:49:31	@sarah_osteopath It's actually Friday!  YAY!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-05 22:58:48	@Sir_Benson @TheCastleE17 lovely chips as well. And roasts. And steaks. And ales. This makes me want a second dinner.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 19:34:39	Half a mile run feeling good, then injury my left knee blew up. This wasn't in the plan for 2014.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 20:00:15	1 year ago today Wstow Cycles started as an idea. 12 months later I'm knee deep in work and looking for a shop!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 20:01:14	So thank you everyone who has helped and had their bike repaired!  It's been a long time ambition to do this.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 20:40:37	@trunds certainly can. E-mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com so I can arrange a collection and repair.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 20:41:48	.@Melbow74 two bike shops in Walthamstow closed down within 18 months! Am I making a mistake trying to open a shop in this town?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 20:54:22	@Melbow74 I'm all ears. Let me know your experience and what your looking for in a local bike shop and I'll see what I can do.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 20:55:13	@Mousey_E17 if like a bike shop 100m from my door as well! Will let you know more details when I've got them.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 20:56:35	@Melbow74 Wood St already has a bike shop. Stall no use at the moment as I'm always about collecting. Good marketing idea though.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 20:57:09	@Walthamstowtown my Dad took me in there back in the 80's when I was a nipper. Could paint my logo on the wall...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 20:58:13	@LucyPadfield collection and return will always be part of the business. That's where it all started from, and long will it continue!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 21:00:55	@meOMalley @Melbow74 Station Cycles are already there. Need to spead the bike shops out! Am thinking near the new Cinema complex.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 21:02:23	@meOMalley I like the size and layout of Heales. Heavily mountain bike specific though.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 21:12:36	@HelenCLondon don't worry. Collection and return is where this all started from, and long will it continue.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 21:14:20	@MrMustard a service is £40 excluding parts but does include pick up and return.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 21:15:23	@garyjohnsons like your thinking! Central or James St?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 21:16:29	@HelenCLondon don't really see me turning up at your door to collect your bike at 730am with a fever as a USP though...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 21:22:38	@bushell @meOMalley very limited footfall through Hatherly Mews.  Have discussed things with @RacerRosa about linking up somehow.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 21:31:12	@meOMalley @bushell Pedalpoint suggested this. Unsure if it's too far from the middle of Walthamstow.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 21:32:13	@meOMalley @bushell now Ditchfields has gone from the Bakers Arms I think if like to be near there to try and fill the void.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 21:33:49	@Rik_E17 what's the problem with the hub you've got?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 21:38:32	@meOMalley @bushell also got to have some quiet roads for test rides as well.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-04 23:15:25	@ByggaBo glad it's back! Looking forward to Feb when myself and @katmilosc have a few days in Copenhagen to ourselves.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-06 22:37:48	Dear Walthamstow twitterers. Thanks for the feedback and suggestions this evening, you're amazing. Sleep well and see you in the morning x
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-07 22:56:47	@jonwayne hey fella, when you coming to London to do a show?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-08 09:43:27	@Frankiejclarke @simonmccann Hey there! Thanks for following. If you need any bicycle repairs let me know!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-08 13:13:14	@caznthat I do! Pedal removal and fitting some new ones is £6. I'm out and about tomorrow night if you want them fitted then?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-08 13:38:17	@caznthat That's fine by me.  E-mail details to WalthamstowCycles@Live.com
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-09 10:01:57	I need hip-hop and coffee. And I need them delivered two hours ago.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-09 19:17:49	.@MPSWForest When I flashed him with car headlights, officer just shrugged at me and cycled past.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-10 08:18:20	Just decided on my new MTB for 2014. This beauty from @GTbicycles and @csgukadamw arrives in about 8 weeks! Excited! http://t.co/Jt2gOvp3Ch
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-10 09:14:45	@MPSinthesky Do you have any photos of the Greenwich Meridian Line light that shines over us in Walthamstow? If not, do you do requests?

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-12 19:09:16	@TheNuclearRaces the wetter the better.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-11 09:57:07	@CuriosE17 The best thing to come out of this is that you managed to walk away and tweet about it.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-12 08:22:36	@TheWmMorris Really?!?!? I've found twitter to be absolutely brilliant at promoting my business with Walthamstow residents.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-18 11:14:29	@56stjames thanks for the lovely coffee! Will have a chat next time when you've settled in and not so busy.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-18 11:41:33	@ruby_pink why the long face? (Looks like a right cutie)

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-21 21:22:11	@LairyGodmother you'll love it. Am currently scouring eBay for a retro Zaskar.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-22 12:10:16	@LairyGodmother what side is the chain falling off? Inside or outside?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-21 21:56:55	@LairyGodmother I look there as well, but forum users know the value of old stuff. I search eBay for poorly listed bikes and parts.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-22 13:00:00	@LairyGodmother ok, perhaps we'll try the green thing again now that the middle chainring has moved.  When you next about?

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-23 08:11:15	Motorists. Please demist your windows properly before setting out on your journey. Cyclists can easily be missed at the best of times.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-23 10:44:00	Currently listen to @BBC6Music in the workshop. Passers by are thinking it's a rave from the 1990s that hasn't ended.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-24 10:02:32	@AlysinSane I like this concept, a lot. Not the nudie lady, but frame artwork. Possible future project? http://t.co/wW1LgU8Rdf
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-24 11:29:26	@AlysinSane I can find one. Gloss or Matt finish? (Was just looking some colour inspiration for a frame respect)
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-24 11:30:38	@AlysinSane in the meantime you could have a doodle on @MichaelMcFry Trek? I'm sure he wouldn't mind.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-25 11:34:31	3 frames off for paint at Armourtex today. A 1952 Raleigh, a Curtis jump frame and my Cotic Soul. http://t.co/0PO9YXci9a
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-25 11:35:15	Cotic Soul has had the brake bosses moved to make it disc specific. http://t.co/BcRFkLE9mj
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-25 11:36:17	Raleigh has had the down tube modified so all cables are now internal. http://t.co/jnHihUlJTZ
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-25 11:36:42	And the Curtis is just having a fresh lick of paint.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-25 19:10:39	@allyoureadlove thanks for the quick chat this afternoon. Best of luck and we hope to be back for coffee/beer soon.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-25 20:12:14	@Mousey_E17 @allyoureadlove up there would be a good location for a bike shop. Good passing footfall and in the centre of the stow.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-26 11:47:35	@Mousey_E17 @thatchrissywood @Bell_E17 @allyoureadlove would like something a bit bigger and brighter, like this http://t.co/vTgX0zLzHw
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-27 17:02:05	@thatchrissywood @newtonline @fabsternation @Mousey_E17 very exciting!  I've wanted this for years! Still early days, am hoping early spring

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-28 16:32:32	@psimonk the bike Guy Martin broke the British speed record on. Think he hot 112mph on it!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-28 16:33:02	@psimonk we were talking about bike speed records just before Christmas.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-28 17:21:47	@WheelBuilding more importantly, is the bike ok?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-28 19:16:45	Today I got to hang out with @guymartinracing British record land speed bicycle. Proper bit of kit. http://t.co/gN8zS4aLTo

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-29 22:19:22	@CuriosE17 now there's an idea! Shame I'm bunged up as that would make an ideal night cap.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-31 21:21:41	@fabsternation @devurrn I've now recovered, was 3 days of feeling awful
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-01-30 23:03:50	@WF4Dogs @ArtsandCrusts @bushell I'd put one up in my house/shop
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-02 18:34:28	Check tyres and inflate to correct pressure, check brakes, lube chain. Will make Monday morning easier if you find a problem now.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-03 08:56:29	@cakesbykath all yours! Will e-mail you in a bit.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-03 09:27:35	@Kate_Bod that typo made me chuckle first thing. Nice article BTW
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-03 09:30:10	@Kate_Bod No.  The word bog, instead of blog in your tweet.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-03 10:02:27	@Kate_Bod you finished the article by mentioning some smelly toilets, so you could get away with it.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-03 12:25:48	@cakesbykath haven't got your e-mail address on file.  Canyou mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com to arrange collection.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-04 08:24:07	A cup of coffee and a @jackoatbar to start the day.  I highly recommend these lovely positive energy bars #rocketfuel http://t.co/3JH5W3iPou

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-05 18:57:03	@jackoatbar it's more of a car and rack at the moment. Hopefully will have a shop soon where we can sell them. Will discuss @bikeandrun :-)
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-05 19:02:17	@jackoatbar certainly have! I'm the short beardy one @bikeandrun aka Tony

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-10 19:56:08	@ArtsandCrusts thanks for the offer, but we're both not about until Wednesday. Unsure the Veg will last that long.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-10 19:58:54	@GreavsieE17 @WalthamstowDad pedals undo toward the back of the bike, bottom brackets undo towards the front of the bike.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-20 21:22:01	An example of Danish cycle design, a shopping mall with undercover bike parking! Hope the E17 cinema complex has one! http://t.co/eyF95EWaAV

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-23 20:24:17	@ChevetteE17 I'm sure I can. Mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com and let me know exact problems so I can prepare to repair!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-23 20:25:07	@holybatpants out collecting tomorrow night for return in Thursday evening if you'd like a brake service.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-23 20:53:07	@John_Ranson hope you get relegated.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-23 20:54:05	@John_Ranson also reckon that's Champions League out of the window for Spurs.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-23 22:52:42	@John_Ranson really want to see West Hanat Brisbane Rd next session!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-22 19:41:38	@goronwy66 sure can! Email detail to WalthamstowCycles@Live.com and I'll arrange a collection.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-16 09:53:14	Sunday + Blue sky + sunshine = bike ride!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-21 12:05:04	@HollBlax keep an eye on http://t.co/C77uzqQo6W lists every bike for sale in London, and updates every hour.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-23 07:47:05	Mudfest Epping here I come!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-23 07:48:49	@John_Ranson only seen the first one but really enjoyed it. Dark comedy at its best.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-23 11:35:52	@holybatpants @wfcycling haven't got a shop yet but I'm working on it! Mobile repairs only at the moment.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-23 12:14:41	@holybatpants I've a few inner tubes in the stock room, and depending on your location I can drop off between 2pm and 3pm
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-21 19:52:00	.@drnjshelton I really enjoyed the respect  that everyone had for each other on the roads. Hopefully the UK can be similar one day.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-25 12:28:52	@cyclingalong @wfcycling @HerbieHerb @thatchrissywood I'm away in Milton Keynes at a trade show. Have a good one!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-25 17:16:45	@wizbitz101 tyres from about £20 each, tubes are £6 each.  Labour would be £20 to fit and raise the bars.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-26 10:39:00	@wizbitz101 I'd come to you and would be done on about 20 minutes. Mail WalthamstowCycles@Live.com to book
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-28 17:39:38	Hey @WildCardBrewery do you allow small well behaved dogs in your bar, like this one? -&gt; http://t.co/s1vZIahqru
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-28 17:45:02	@fabsternation @Billtix @edryanE17 @WildCardBrewery Morris had 3 beers? But he's only tiny...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-01 16:20:12	@fabsternation I do buy used bikes, but(no offence) don't tend to touch the low end Halfords bikes due to the low quality of the end product
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-01 16:30:28	@fabsternation have a chat with @AnalogPuss I believe he recycles old bikes, or know a man that does!

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-02-26 15:59:33	@MrMustard Don't know about the secure bike parking, bit I leave mine on the hoops at the top of the market.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-02 15:36:40	Seen on the window of the Carr Road Post Office. Anyone spot the mistake? http://t.co/ZFZwInbRKQ
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-01 22:24:41	@LairyGodmother and sensible soccer for the boredom?

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-05 14:00:35	@lougreenwood not a problem. I've a bb facing tool as well if required. What colour did you go for?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-05 14:17:17	@lougreenwood @CoticLtd very nice. I love my one to bits, perfect Epping hard tail.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-10 15:20:26	@cyclingalong @fabsternation @bushell @Mousey_E17 Looks interesting, send me a photocopy?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-14 07:56:30	Proper foggy out. You know the drill: Make sure you can see, make sure you can be seen. Stay safe everyone!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-13 20:33:22	@KOOCH1N should have mentioned the new improved braking... enjoying stopping!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-13 20:37:36	Selling my '98 Honda Fireblade RRW to fund the new shop. If you know anyone who might be interested, send them my way http://t.co/e81yqQ5EAv

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-13 20:40:13	@KOOCH1N that bike is 15 years old?!?!?! well done, and well looked after.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-13 22:37:50	It's not you, it's me. Farewell Optimus, safe journey x http://t.co/0P9YcAb8WX
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-12 08:34:46	Such a beautiful morning! Such a shame to have to be in a bus and not on a bike.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-12 08:55:49	@ladymajm I wish you the best of luck! Am about to go underground...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-12 18:36:33	@ChungLawrence A service is £40, this excludes parts but includes collection and return.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-17 11:10:41	@Mousey_E17 the shop is coming very very soon!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-17 11:23:20	@Mousey_E17 got to decide, but have good contacts with Ridgeback, Genesis, Bianchi, Cannondale, Trek and Cervelo.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-16 19:20:32	One bed 'Warner Van' for sale, can be parked near the William Morris gallery.   Offers in excess of £250k. http://t.co/S7PW4xWi6Y

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-16 10:56:34	Rare morning off. Currently sitting out the back of the @WMGallery in the beautiful garden with a coffee. #andrelax http://t.co/ZlmPHDy2Qn
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-16 21:14:57	@SnrHeadhunter no, it's a hire van. Currently discussing shop van and it's essentials. So far has to have alloy wheels and racing stripes.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-18 06:46:47	@fabsternation I saw that, best of luck to them. I'm going to be aiming my sights at a different part of the market than them.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-17 13:03:04	@Mousey_E17 Going to have to see what the local cyclists require, will test with what I can get hold of and then work it out from there
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-17 14:27:13	@Mousey_E17 @lateraltruth was thinking more Brian Harvey
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-19 20:30:03	Great for steering/holding on to your bike! Local E17 @sarah_osteopath on Shoulder Exercise for Flexibility–Pendulum http://t.co/tImPENXFHk
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-17 13:21:41	@clairebradshaw @Mousey_E17 Possibly, but it's all about the bikes first. Coffee/cake/Whiskey Bar comes second.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-17 18:52:32	@HelenCLondon if you check your footage when exiting Lloyd Park yesterday,you'll notice me saying hello and workshop dog getting in the way!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-17 19:37:39	@HelenCLondon focused on the mileage ahead! Looked a great day for a long ride.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-18 11:32:10	@devurrn I use brake/carburetor cleaner purchased from Clarkins in the workshop.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-19 21:27:25	If you can't buy it, you've got to make it.   Custom brake cable soldering (fao @ccolorizer ) http://t.co/scUH37yU3e
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-20 11:33:03	@romain_vincelot nice photo, but I did it first with @MichaelMcFry  all the best for the season run in. http://t.co/VUI3MLQoki
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-20 19:26:18	Thanks @Mousey_E17 I collect, repair and then return @greenrocinante and I'm currently booking for next week!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-20 20:06:05	@greenrocinante @Mousey_E17 no worries. I'm here when you (and other Walthamstow cyclists) need me.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-23 19:16:20	Great ride over Swinley this morning. Apart from the hail stones,made it look like winter @Adams070369 @MichaelMcFry http://t.co/c2G8HEiccW
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-24 20:57:49	Having some fun at Swinley http://t.co/rw70MbERFP
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-24 09:31:20	@John_Ranson @bbc6music I turned it up to 11 and bounced around the workshop.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-24 09:32:09	@odriscolld Certainly. I'm out collecting tomorrow night for return on Thursday if that works for you?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-24 11:34:46	@odriscolld excellent. Mail your details to WalthamstowCycles@Live.com and I'll get a collection organised.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-26 19:33:07	@JettaWillis I have, but the bikes first. Coffee and cake come second. Maybe one day we'll have some @woodstcoffee in store...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-26 19:37:45	@Mousey_E17 No. Property is empty, decorated and ready to go. Solicitors being slow. http://t.co/jfRsIf5PyE
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-26 19:51:38	@Mousey_E17 many thanks. I'm pleased with the location, ticked a lot of boxes. Just need the keys to the property!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-25 23:09:16	@Adams070369 @minienduro I do... But my left knee doesn't. Might have to grit the teeth and mtfu.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-25 23:10:50	@cafebonitoe17 what playground feature are you most looking forward to? I'm a slide kinda guy.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-25 23:22:57	@fabsternation motorbikes aren't the problem. It's the motorists that hit them.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-27 09:44:35	Shreddies, donut, and a powerful coffee.  Breakfast of the busy bicycle mechanic.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-26 19:24:59	Sold my motorbike today. Sad day but the need for a bike shop in Walthamstow is greater! Hopefully have an update regarding the shop soon.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-26 19:45:23	@Adams070369 @minienduro I'm in. See you at the start gate.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-26 19:47:36	@Mousey_E17 keep the location a secret, don't want to ruin the surprise!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-28 10:09:36	@HarrySewell No.  I send them off to a third party for service/repair.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-29 19:01:03	@RolandKarthaus sure can. I'm back out in Walthamstow on Tuesday evening if that works for you?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-29 19:06:22	@RolandKarthaus make sure you grease the ones!  Opening soon, hopefully have the lease signed next week.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-26 19:30:13	@Mousey_E17 same here! I had my offer on the shop accepted 3 months ago now, and still don't have an opening date set.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-26 21:40:40	@LucyPadfield @woodstcoffee @JettaWillis @KineticBicycles this should solve the problem. http://t.co/dksP2BoqMT

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-28 21:02:01	@HarrySewell shifters are usually away between 5 ton7 working days. Depends how busy they are.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-28 21:01:09	@HarrySewell sounds iffy! What model are your shifters?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-28 21:02:25	@HarrySewell hopefully soon. Location is a secret!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-03-30 21:45:05	@MPSinthesky Chelsea

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-03 05:56:05	@cakesbykath maybe, I'm thinking of commandeering Whipps Cross roundabout. MiniHolland will be complete by then? @psimonk
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-03 07:01:24	@danbrowne77 I've a slot next week. Collection Tuesday evening for return on Thursday evening Orkney for you?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-03 07:02:31	@psimonk @cakesbykath will need to dash after to get to a TV. Going to be a sprinters finish and Cav will want it the most.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-03 07:37:07	@danbrowne77 mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com and we can go from there.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-03 07:38:14	Time to go ride Epping on the summer bike!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-03 08:27:56	Should have taken the winter bike... http://t.co/JBgoXuzHyc
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-03 09:56:04	@meOMalley @psimonk @cakesbykath I'd of liked to have seen the peloton get under that railway bridge down Coppermill Lane.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-03 11:22:09	@psimonk @cakesbykath Whipps X roundabout crew? Would love to watch the tour with some @WildCardBrewery @woodstcoffee and @Chipswithdipsuk
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-03 13:35:28	@LucyPadfield @woodstcoffee @psimonk @cakesbykath @WildCardBrewery @Chipswithdipsuk shall I ask the council if we can have the roundabout?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-03 13:36:21	@LucyPadfield @woodstcoffee @psimonk @cakesbykath @WildCardBrewery @Chipswithdipsuk or shall we just rock up and have it large?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-02 08:45:53	@BeaninStow Sounds good but I'll be miles down the road by then... maybe a warm down/recovery stretch though...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-02 19:21:36	@HarrySewell no problems. Be sure to do frequent cable changes on Campagnolo shifters, heavy cables seem to strain the internals.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-02 19:22:05	I smell summer on the horizon...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-02 19:22:55	I also smell the Tour de France!  Only 93 days until it comes through Waltham Forest.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-03 20:20:04	Power cut up in Hale End area. I'd finished my dinner about 30 seconds earlier. Could have been messy.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-03 20:51:28	@dearemilyeavis power is back up here.  I've got the lights and the TV on, kettle is boiling for my horlicks. #modernlifeisgood
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-05 16:05:51	@HelenCLondon @veloevol @cyclegaz @bikeandrun It's actually a Trek fitting system we use (very similar to cyclefit)

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-08 16:01:03	@psimonk think you're confusing Jungle music with Garage music. #grandad
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-08 19:44:32	@psimonk I was thinking 're-rewind, and the crowd say bo selecta'
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-08 19:45:30	@Spoons72 hey. I really need to sort my website out... Mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com and we can go from there.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-06 08:01:30	Butlers retreat, quick snack then anther 15 miles. http://t.co/VZMHnXsDpT
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-06 11:42:37	@EFMTB was great, wet warm and just the right amount of slippy to keep it fun.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-06 11:44:31	@Melbow74 sure can, but I'm fully booked until the 22nd of April if that's ok with you?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-06 12:11:33	@Melbow74 It's great being busy, but hate turning business away.Hopefully with the shop opening soon I'll be able to offer better timescales
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-06 12:15:10	@EFMTB sadly, yes...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-11 08:09:51	Knee physio first thing this morning.  Let's hope they can get me fixed so I can have a fast summer.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-11 10:53:24	@ifancykitkat I've got one slot left for collection on Tuesday the 22nd of April if that works for you?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-11 12:18:28	Just seen the most amazing funeral go past.Truck had a sound system,disco + coffin on the back blaring out garage music.Last wish granted!

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-10 18:37:26	@danbrowne77 thanks for the kind tweet. Safe riding.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-14 20:03:56	@litildevil few questions: grind or click/creak? Standing or sitting? Drive side or non?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-14 20:06:13	Fully booked until the 29th of April, and I'm booking fast! If you need a service let me know sooner rather than later!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-14 20:07:11	Don't forget, I collect, repair and then return your bicycle. No wheeling a broken bike to a far away shop!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-14 20:54:37	@LairyGodmother commute on a DH bike? won't feel them as you run over them...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-15 06:06:09	@litildevil try changing pedals first. If not it's a chainset/chainring/bb/bb thread issue.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-15 06:15:27	@litildevil I do. Shop slang.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-15 06:29:45	@litildevil I don't, yet! A bb strip down and thread recut is £20.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-15 06:51:35	@litildevil for me, yes..
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-15 07:10:31	@litildevil sounds like you need to watch YouTube, experiment, and give me a shout to fix if it all goes wrong.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-15 07:13:33	@litildevil you'll probably also need buy this tool, or similar http://t.co/2Cr91S1T9q
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-15 08:07:51	@knee17 easier to mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com not restricted to 140 characters!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-16 18:05:19	@danbrowne77 @fabsternation I looked at this for a bike shop, but £50k a year rent and a £25k premium was a bit too rich for my liking.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-16 18:08:44	@danbrowne77 signing the lease next week. You should be able to walk to it in under 2 minutes!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-16 19:39:33	Signing the shop lease next week! Not long now!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-16 20:03:00	@BeaninStow secret is still mine at the moment!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-17 07:51:40	@woodstcoffee save two for me! Be there soon!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-17 08:04:02	@telent_net how about a photo? http://t.co/z5ATlaTTgS
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-17 08:06:00	.@telent_net shop Brands to be finalised, but it looks like Trek, Bianchi and Ridgeback so far. Shop located very 'central'
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-17 19:21:58	@bushell or Walthamstowers called James...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-17 19:11:47	@meOMalley very nice but no access to them at the moment.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-17 19:17:55	@bushell covers all bases apart from fold up bikes...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-18 08:47:01	Fast MTB ride heading out from Waterworks at 12 midday. Who's in?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-18 09:02:46	@fabsternation that place needs to be opened up for open water swimming. The Triathletes would love it.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-18 14:10:01	If you go down to the woods today, you'll find it incredibly fast and dry! Get your mountain bike out ASAP!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-18 17:57:19	@AlysinSane @edarcherthinks you seen @glutenstow ? Right up your street I reckon #GlutenDodgers

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-20 19:35:53	This tag is all over Walthamstow. Anybody know what it's about? http://t.co/mym0nlLhTm
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-21 09:06:28	@ByggaBo what time are you open today? And do you allow small well behaved dogs in like this one? http://t.co/ue21iSDkLo
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-21 18:47:08	@Melbow74 did you book in? Can't see you in the diary.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-21 18:48:27	@ByggaBo been and gone. Had a nice time! See you again soon x
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-21 18:57:23	@Melbow74 yes, but have now taken more bookings. Can probably squeeze you in. Can you mail me your details to WalthamstowCycles@Live.com
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-26 06:19:41	Anyone else up and watching the Australian UCI DH World Cup on Redbull TV?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-25 09:29:48	@Mousey_E17 no problems. @thatchrissywood had the 1st slot, you can have the 2nd if you like?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-25 14:06:27	@Underground_LDN No he wasn't.  Born at Highgate. East Finchley is an above ground station, so no protection against bombs.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-25 18:34:54	@E17Designers @ClaudeBinns I'm hoping to have mile long queues everyday...

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-04-29 11:35:00	@WillMorrisbar I did, but I'm working. Might be better if you sent tweets about drinking later in the afternoon just as people leave work :)

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-04 05:43:48	Can anyone advise on the conditions over Epping? Is it back to dry or is it still muddy and wet from Thursdays downpours?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-04 06:23:50	@EFMTB I don't mind that! Just don't want to have to take my mud bike out.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-04 07:03:38	@sidman10001 @EFMTB I did 25 very wet miles on Thurs, and don't want to do the same again. Might let it dry today and go tomorrow.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-22 06:36:08	Looks like we've avoided the thunder storms. I'm going for a dry ride around Epping to celebrate.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-22 07:52:30	No more Epping Forest for me. B*stard log has claimed my rear mech. http://t.co/pRonb1Av5J
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-22 14:01:06	@robevans10 ah yes! How was your trip? Manage to keep it rubber side down? And how was the bike post service?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-22 18:47:23	RT @aberdonianlad: Lovely cycle today along the #riverlea from #e17 to Ponders End...loving my bike at the mo! http://t.co/4iccskx9TC
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-22 12:45:06	@robevans10 still don't know. Just had a massive rant at the Landlords solicitors so hopefully that will get things moving.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-22 14:53:10	Dear @ToastieBarks , workshop dog wanted me to send this. Best of luck with the election. http://t.co/44L52OeGOC
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-25 17:43:42	@John_Ranson indeed. Horrible way to end a season. Doubt we'll see an O's team like this for a many years.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-25 09:14:27	@HoltBe backed off tension pin completely? If so, grit teeth and pull. Probably is a special tool but don't know anyone who had one.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-25 09:25:25	@HoltBe try an old motorbike trick: saddle rails in freezer for 30mins, and saddle in a bucket of hot water. Then go for it.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-25 09:30:06	A very rare 'no-ride' Sunday today, as I'm going to an even rarer event. All the best to @leytonorientfc at #Wembley this afternoon.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-26 08:49:53	@askgeez I'm looking for good honest wheel to wheel racing, sound like I'll have to look elsewhere.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-26 08:10:35	Worth catching up on the Monaco GP? Or was it a massively boring?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-26 08:53:54	@ShazzaF1 I'm looking for some motor racing action, not a sponsorship procession... I'll look elsewhere.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-26 08:57:15	@askgeez might catch up the NW200 motorcycle racing.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-26 10:51:18	@caznthat just replied to your email.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-25 14:08:29	Come on @leytonorientfc http://t.co/y8FSQj30NT
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-28 14:49:40	@ChevetteE17 Sure can.  Full resto? Something custom? or just get it roadworthy?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-28 14:54:42	@ChevetteE17 No probs.  Think I've a spare set of 3 speed hub guts somewhere... Collection on the 3rd work?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-05-28 14:55:56	@ChevetteE17 sure I can't tempt you with a resto? Here's a 1952 Raleigh I just finished http://t.co/KbPFwj4CGI
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-01 17:53:36	If you're heading home through Woodford Green there may be some traffic. 2 motorcycles have crashed whilst speeding.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-01 19:34:59	@askgeez that's the bunch. No care about other road users. Best they hurt themselves than others.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-01 19:36:53	Just back from a beautiful weekend in Woolacombe. If you tried contacting me over the weekend, I'll be in touch tomorrow.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-01 19:40:11	Here's a photo of the sunset over Woolacombe bay on Friday... http://t.co/lYOvUxeJNf
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-01 19:55:39	@Adams070369 a little bit. Decided to bodyboard as was easier.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-01 21:21:53	@Francis_Mat depends what you want... Value/Chris Bling or something in between?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-04 10:48:23	@Philternz really need to know the forest to get the best out of it, I've a 24 mile Singletrack loop. I can be hired for coffee and cake.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-03 13:02:19	@Francis_Mat FSA are always good value.  Cane Creek 40 series are well built.  Both nowhere near as good as a King.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-03 13:03:28	@simondoggett More than happy to help.  You can e-mail me on WalthamstowCycles@Live.com
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-04 10:31:58	Sometimes there's nothing better than riding a well set up hard tail around Epping Forest.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-04 08:00:58	RT @BeatriceCurnew: THANK YOU trustworthy people of #E17 Left my bike unlocked in station bike shed for 5 days and he’s still here!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-05 18:44:49	Anyone know why there is so much traffic tonight?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-05 19:34:52	@oXjacXo I'm out collecting on the evening of the 10th for return on the 12th if that works for you?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-05 19:37:38	@oXjacXo yay! Mail details to WalthamstowCycles@Live.com and I'll get you booked in.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-05 19:39:59	The World Cup is coming, but I'm more looking forward to the Tour de France coming through Walthamstow! http://t.co/yQIyF2cy7B
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-06 08:47:01	@ByggaBo do you want to have a child seat and pannier bags at the same time?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-06 09:23:19	@ByggaBo I stock the Hamax range, which don't need racks to fit to. The rails flex meaning more comfort. http://t.co/6dsK4pA8D7
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-06 10:56:54	@ByggaBo It's £89.99 and fitting is free.  Can probably get it fitted one evening next week for you.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-06 12:07:47	@ilovewalthamsto How many gears does the bike have?  I'm out collecting on the evening of the 10th for return on the 12th if that works?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-06 14:43:30	@ilovewalthamsto e-mail is WalthamstowCycles@Live.com and phone is 07790356470
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-06 15:57:00	@ByggaBo I'll get the seat back to my Walthamstow workshop and then get in contact with.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-07 18:57:46	@la_mutualista booking for collection on Tuesday evening for return on Thursday evening if that suits?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-09 12:52:51	@meOMalley Can I pick up the wheel tomorrow night for the rebuild?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-08 14:16:29	@la_mutualista cool. Send a mail to WalthamstowCycles@Live.com with details and I'll get you booked in.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-09 15:48:09	How was the Dragon ride for you? @mrsevans1981 @maschmidtwit
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-09 20:59:44	@ChevetteE17 thought you would. Will hopefully have a 3 speed hub you'll love by the end of the week.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-08 20:03:52	Got one repair slot left this week, who wants it?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-08 20:39:38	@meOMalley certainly can, what wheel are you after?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-08 21:07:44	@meOMalley are you running Campagnolo or Shimano?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-08 21:26:59	@meOMalley rebuild exhausting hub onto a Mavic Open Pro rim would be my recommendation.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-10 13:30:20	@ByggaBo Child seat on way to Walthamstow!  Ok to collect the bike tonight for fitting?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-10 09:26:01	This is why I always were gloves when working on bicycles. http://t.co/fz9m9wzvB3

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-10 11:03:50	@wynwoodcoffee I'm currently trying to sort a shop out.  I've also got to sort my website out...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-11 20:37:35	I'll take that compliment! RT @ChevetteE17: @ilovewalthamsto @WstowCycles he is the best bike mechanic in London! And a quality bloke too

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-14 16:22:33	@newtonline No problem.  Mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com and I'll arrange a collection.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 19:39:55	No estate agents involved. Just the Landlord and HSR Solicitors. @thatchrissywood @Mousey_E17 @stellacreasy
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 19:40:24	@Estates_17 many thanks, will do.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 19:41:00	@melanienorton @GodsOwnJunkyard @WildCardBrewery @Chipswithdipsuk @MothersRuinE17 that's a good idea. Will have a look.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 19:43:26	@BlackhorseWS @WalthamstowDad sounds good. How about Thursday? And what biscuits should I bring?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 19:43:55	@WalthamstowDad @WarrantOE17 sounds interesting.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 19:54:55	@Sdex8 certainly is. I've a few ideas though.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 19:55:52	@thatchrissywood many thanks For your support x
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-18 06:51:38	@Brigit_Collins @jamesprints if it said "Cambridge-Walthamstow-London" I'd have one ;-)
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-18 09:52:49	@ByggaBo badass flames, or pink hearts? http://t.co/nrUu3wxfe8

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-15 13:33:27	@LairyGodmother @SnrHeadhunter they're PR's. Probably uphill sections where I'm usually lazy....
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-18 14:26:54	@sveinc A service is £40, this includes collection and return but excludes parts (if required) you can book at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-18 14:46:15	@BlackhorseWS @WalthamstowDad I'm at work all day Friday... I'll be in contact on Monday to try and sort something out.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 10:34:18	A 45 mile road ride before work is good for the soul (and legs)
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 11:59:46	@LairyGodmother thanks for sharing.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 13:25:50	@LairyGodmother Need to get you doing more miles over the forest as I'm going to enter you in a 24 hour race next year.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-18 18:25:23	@jellomorton @WarrantOE17 @WalthamstowDad @dgoneill Or at the bar... "Sorry I'm late, my bike broke..."
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-18 19:56:01	Yes, on the platform 1 side. I’ve never used it but one of my followers will have info @Live_Long_Day There is a bike shed at the station???
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-18 19:59:41	Workshop dog made a new friend today with @Comparethemeerk http://t.co/jjbh5CCFMi
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-16 17:51:59	@ilovewalthamsto how long did it take you? And did you cycle back?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-16 19:28:47	Turns out my suspension forks are toasted. Will just have to go buy those @RockShox forks I've wanted for ages.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 18:28:15	Right... Looks like I've been gazumped... 119 Hoe Street isn't happening. As you can imagine, this makes me very sad...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 18:30:18	So, it's taken 7 months, and quite a bit of cash, and now the Solicitor and Landlord won't return calls/e-mails/texts.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 18:32:09	But, they're not going to get me down!  I'm still looking for a property to trade from in E17, and have a plan...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 18:34:10	Plan is to improve the mobile collection and return service.  I'm going to try and do next night turnarounds and offer more repair slots.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 18:34:10	If you've any suggestions on how I could make my collection/repair service better, please let me know.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-17 19:50:21	@gaildoggett 1500 feet should do it. Whereabouts on St James? And what restaurant was it?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-19 10:43:48	Just had a nice swim at the Pool and Track. Tried to sneak onto the diving boards but couldn't get through.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-19 12:05:29	@LairyGodmother that involves putting my head and my amazing hair under water.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-19 12:06:40	@GooseE17 go Colambia! (Wherever that is...)
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-20 17:43:10	@Mousey_E17 was a very intense session! I left them well alone...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-19 06:41:56	@woodstcoffee be with you in a bit.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-19 13:04:35	@LairyGodmother yep, and I go Anti clockwise in the fast lane.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-21 13:32:39	@Melbow74 @RoofLondon @Blackhorsestow1 sounds a bit pokey...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-21 13:32:46	@BraumasterBen sure can!  I've got some custom tooling I made for those so easy for me to remove.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-21 14:54:33	@Melbow74 @RoofLondon @Blackhorsestow1 
many thanks for thinking of me!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-21 21:22:45	@BraumasterBen mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com and I'll book you in.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-21 06:44:28	@sveinc Wilkinsons?? Want me to pop some Bontrager tubes over?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-21 06:56:19	@sveinc if it's standard length valve, then £6 each or 3 for £15.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-21 07:00:38	@sveinc mail me your address to WalthamstowCycles@Live.com and I'll get them over.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-21 07:09:01	@sveinc I take it that's why you're awake and up!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-21 07:27:59	@sveinc turns out I've only 80mm tubes.  Am heading to stock room now and back in E17 at 6pm. That work for you?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-21 20:31:15	@BraumasterBen I'm booking for collection on Tuesday evening for return Thursday evening if that works for you?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-22 11:20:19	Time to dust the mountain bike #summerloving http://t.co/r9bRg2RzAK
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-22 11:41:23	@ChevetteE17 got this in my 'manual' collection. The 2000sl estate looks like a beast. http://t.co/bLx7S0fZ7L
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-22 14:21:15	@fabsternation @ChevetteE17 I've just started looking for one on eBay... I can't have another project, can I?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-22 14:22:22	@philrowe78 sure can! Mail details to WalthamstowCycles@Live.com and I'll get it booked in for a collection.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-22 14:22:56	@fabsternation what rag is that in?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-22 15:44:43	@ChevetteE17 really need to get a shop, van, motorbike sorted before the next project...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-20 12:32:10	@StowBrothers Kinda a mix between Shreaded Wheat and Space Invaders
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-23 18:00:07	A big thank you tweet to everyone who replied to my 'I'm not getting a shop' tweet. Made a good few contacts and something's on the horizon!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-24 06:08:24	@emma_fergie ok, will keep my eye out for you.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-20 16:30:56	@macfras Unsure if it's of any use but a few mums met @ByggaBo on Thursday with loads of swaps.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-22 20:31:44	@emma_fergie what style of bike are you after? and what sort of price are you thinking of spending?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-22 20:33:37	@fabsternation I'd like a read.  Am starting to do a lot more custom bike builds myself.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-22 20:55:21	@ChevetteE17 I regularly trawl through the 'barn find' section on eBay.  Almost purchased a non running Dodge A100 Van the other week...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-23 18:42:02	.@Philternz in a nutshell: solicitor and landlord not replying to calls or e-mails. 7 months, a load of cash out of pocket, and no shop :-(
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-25 19:46:36	After a hard 25 mile cycle, I deserve this sunset. Photo taken from Waterworks looking over Walthamstow E17 http://t.co/GaEu84qZcY

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-26 20:39:04	I love Thursday evening bicycle returns. The smile on customers' faces when I return working bikes makes the hard work I put in worthwhile.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-06-26 20:40:55	However, my customers might be smiling because I returned their bike and not nicked it...

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-07 20:14:36	@wizbitz101 Between 6pm and 7pm
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-07 21:01:27	@Sir_Benson I do, want me to freshen the Bianchi up?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-08 21:09:12	@fussellface not yet. I've a van arriving on Friday and will hopefully be doing collections further afield soon.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 17:36:39	Selling another motorbike to help fund Wstow Cycles... 1984 Honda CB750F2 project if anyone wants one? http://t.co/tV9pM49ugk
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 17:37:12	@wynwoodcoffee you're geeky about coffee, I'm geeky about bikes. Long live the geek!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 17:56:00	@Umwelt_E17 just sold via eBay under a buy it now price after 5 minutes of being listed.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 18:00:32	Honda now sold.  Went on eBay after 5 minutes...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 18:02:40	Am now down to two motorbikes.  This makes me a bit sad.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 18:24:28	Have just found out that Chris Chance of Fat Chance MTB's is going to start building frames again.  This makes me incredibly happy.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 18:31:19	@Umwelt_E17 Thanks but now sold! Those lights you linked to the other day looked funky.  Would like to test them first though.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-10 15:07:55	@Sir_Benson Can you email address details to WalthamstowCycles@Live.com please.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-08 13:00:45	@Spoons72 tough one... best I''ve ridden is the Gocycle, but it's more collapsible than folding. I'd avoid anything sub £1000.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-08 13:01:11	@Spoons72 have you a folding bike at the moment? could perhaps look at bolting a motor and battery to it.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 08:26:56	Instead of going out riding, I'm sorting out insurances. #wild #crazy
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 08:27:31	What I really want to do is get off the computer and phone, and go do some drifting on the mountain bike.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 08:29:02	Kinda like this photo of Kovarik, although probably a bit slower, and a smaller rooster... http://t.co/kLsj6HXhoG
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 09:19:01	@LairyGodmother did you see the video of Ratboy over shooting the bridge jump at the weekend? Proper heel slapper
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 09:56:42	I'm tired... I just asked for my van insurance to start in 1979...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 11:10:22	@Sir_Benson can collect Monday evening for return on Thursday evening for return on Monday evening if that works for you.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 11:18:54	@wynwoodcoffee need coffee... you got coffee?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 11:21:34	@wynwoodcoffee it really doesn't matter right now! A handful of beans to eat would work!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 11:32:19	@wynwoodcoffee I've a Krups based machine at home, but it's mostly espresso based away from the house
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-10 21:56:27	@cyclingalong look what I've got... Modification to start on Friday. http://t.co/D6sIvKRUsi
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-09 14:51:47	@Sir_Benson need coffee.... but yes, collection Monday for return on Thursday.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-10 22:23:29	@cyclingalong not yet. I'm going to sort the hub widths first and then build before picking the bike up.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-08 18:53:01	@Spoons72 ok, I'll do some research and see what I can figure out. Will keep you updated.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-08 20:51:11	Hi @fussellface how can I be of service?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-11 18:14:10	Tonight is the last night with 'Minze' sorting out bikes.For a small VW you've done very well for the last 18months. http://t.co/PgOvr075jC
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-11 20:51:30	@maschmidtwit I've got a van arriving tomorrow. Will be able to collect more bikes, and be more efficient whilst doing it.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-11 20:52:35	@maschmidtwit I'll also be able to put my track bike and mx bike in it, as well as being able to convert it into a day van/camper when req.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-15 08:08:42	The apprentice has just handed me a coffee and a courier has just delivered my new @Hopetech parts. Not a bad start for a Monday.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-14 07:37:31	It's time for: Sunday morning Singletrack!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-13 11:44:53	.@rebeccafolland Rome wasn't built in a day, but some of it was.  I'm looking forward to the future of cycling in LBWF #miniholland
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-14 11:04:01	@litildevil I use a Topeak phone mount on my handlebars to film. Not great quality but enough to help.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-14 11:04:30	@LairyGodmother get out there this afternoon. It's fast, dry and dusty.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-14 11:05:46	@meOMalley it's unbelievable what happens to people when they get in a car. It goes: Pedestrian, cyclist, motor vehicle.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-17 12:26:22	@LairyGodmother went around the Blair Witch loop again this morning.  Someones been building trails and it's now easier to navigate.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-17 13:11:33	@LairyGodmother yeah, just shaking down the GT after it's rebuild.  I'll check if I'm about Sunday morning. Road or MTB?

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-17 18:27:30	I've decided that the new @Tesco in Wood St E17 is rubbish. No @RedStripeLager anywhere.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-17 18:47:54	@JPotterIrwin @Tesco @RedStripeLager that's why I left and went up the road to another shop. Never again.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-17 18:48:49	@sarah_osteopath I don't know, was outraged so stormed out.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-17 18:51:04	Thanks @Tesco I usually go to buy @RedStripeLager as I usually need it there and then (or shortly after) no time to order stock.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-20 18:18:35	@Adams070369 nice-ish... would you like some bar ends on yours?

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-21 19:24:55	New van = more capacity to collect bikes for servicing! Now have an extra 4 slots a week, who wants one?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-21 19:30:16	@yellowlolly mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com with details and I'll get both bikes booked in.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-21 19:52:47	.@Londoncarolyn I saw! Many thanks! Unfortunately I can't recommend myself but it seems I've got a fantastic customer base who can.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-22 10:20:31	@WheelBuilding you done anything cool re spoke colour with Pewter Hub,black rims? I'm thinking black spokes but 2 x silver at valve, 3 cross
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-22 10:26:57	Wheel build day here in the workshop. Can you spot your hubs @Adams070369 @cyclingalong ? http://t.co/2U5eSpH9rW

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-23 11:00:35	@Mousey_E17 Brompton bikes fold, Tern bikes collapse, if that makes sense...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-23 11:02:50	@Mousey_E17 Bromptons fold into a neat package, perfect for commuting bike/train/bike. Terns are more collapse each end of the journey.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-22 11:38:42	It's up to me to come up with the ideas... I might try 2 silver spokes on the lace up to see how it looks.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-24 19:30:23	@meOMalley @fabsternation what do you mean by 'cycle facilities'?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-09-24 19:38:59	@meOMalley @fabsternation boils down to Halfords giving LBWF a cheaper loan set up cost. Cscheme costs independents 10% of final sale price.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-07 20:59:55	Apparently this bike had been creaking for 'about' a year. Give your bike frame a good check every now and then http://t.co/27hZy4d9t9

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-08 14:48:28	@rogerclapham let me know if you find a safe place to retreat to... I'm thinking Chingford.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-08 19:00:25	Yesterday I advised on frame checks. Today I urge you to check your wheels every now and then. http://t.co/iENOluhnrr
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-08 19:06:51	@bushell shall we see how many facebook/Twitter warnings your bike can generate?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-09 08:35:10	@craftguerrilla got some bicycles to fix up, maybe squeeze a bike ride in as well...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-09 10:39:54	I've got a huge urge to go spank all my savings on an MX bike today Must...not...add...to....basket... Must...not....buy...it...now
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-09 10:41:53	I've also got a massive urge to buy a Ducati 916.  Today might get expensive.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-09 10:44:14	@MichaelMcFry you can vote for Yassars to be the best restaurant in E17 http://t.co/DGZfO9fAxM
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-09 10:55:29	@maschmidtwit I've got the lurgy.  I'm not going anywhere today.  Think I might turn the Xbox on and ignore ebay.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-09 13:10:22	@meOMalley do you want to buy a used mx bike or Ducati 916 off me in about 12 months?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-09 14:16:18	@LairyGodmother can you ride motorbikes?  Am thinking of organising a MX day out for early feb.  Understand if your hands are full...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-09 15:18:47	@LairyGodmother Not really... You need to know where the controls are and have some experince with motorbikes to get the best out of it.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-09 18:48:09	1/2 So over the past two days we've covered frame and wheel checks.  Tonight it's time to check your ability!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-09 18:49:08	2/2  Unsure about that gap in traffic, the fast line via a rock garden?perhaps give it a miss, I learnt the hard way! http://t.co/YyvlpHTl3J
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-10 09:26:22	@TheoDounis1 @Renthal_Cycling you will not be disappointed!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-09 19:05:22	@MrMustard no, a couple of years ago. Ambition outweighed talent.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-10 19:09:09	@coshgirl it's when a 4x4 slows down to a crawl to negotiate a speed hump that gets me. And when they have trouble parking.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-10 19:11:03	@coshgirl I haven't finished! and when it's lowered (wtf is that about) and when they're painted white. And when they've massive alloys.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-13 08:07:38	@psimonk @wallyrider takes 20 mins to get used to the grip and then it rips. The old Swinley trails out there if you know where to look.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-13 11:10:32	@FLOOR_STORY sorted ;-)

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-18 10:48:56	@abimwilliams Last time I saw Andy Chairman trading was at the Antiques shop Finamore on Orford Road.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-17 16:31:28	@brokenriders can't at the moment, but can direct you to a rock garden in the Peaks that will happily dislocate fingers and break elbows.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-19 19:55:11	All restorations start the same. A sad pile of metal and parts on the floor. ( FAO @ChevetteE17 ) http://t.co/oeI7ah8aIg
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-21 18:57:03	Who's the owner of the cargo bike with the shark teeth on the side? That's a badass ride you've got there(please RT so this finds the owner)
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-21 06:41:15	@ClaudeBinns sure thing,Front or Rear? Will bring a new brake and fit while-u-wait. If all goes to plan @ChevetteE17 bike should be with me
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-22 10:57:12	@Mousey_E17 hi! @sickbikerepairs how's it all going?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-22 12:11:16	@joncrossley new boy Steve is out collecting on Monday evening for Thursday return if that works for you?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-22 12:12:10	@evajrobins best to e-mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com and we can go from there.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-22 18:27:29	@wynwoodcoffee That's cool.  I've only one photo of my great grandfather, taken when he was signed up for the army in the First World War
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-22 18:29:10	@wynwoodcoffee Unfortunately he died in the Battle of the Somme, so no opportunity to take any more. Found his grave by accident in 1996.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-22 13:19:14	@Mousey_E17 @sickbikerepairs with the Badass cargo bike!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-22 15:05:34	@wynwoodcoffee what year was that taken?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-22 18:40:09	I love a restoration! 1936 Royal Enfield Tandem with a fresh set of wheels, gears and brakes. @cyclingalong http://t.co/CV2sa2snuq
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-22 18:40:45	@cyclingalong turns out @meOMalley want's a go... maybe wants to make and offer???
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-21 10:45:34	@evajrobins sturdy little robust trailers.  I can get hold of them as well, what size do you require?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-21 10:46:52	@cakesbykath it's disgusting.  Cool to pop over and collect your bike tonight?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-21 11:00:07	@evajrobins Bigger wheels will give you better stability and better over bumpy roads. But really does depend on how much you want to carry.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-20 21:52:23	@LucyPadfield Once I figure out my route I'll let you know.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-21 13:16:42	@evajrobins the only other thing to consider is the width.  SM 580mm vs LG 720mm... in traffic size SM wins.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-21 13:32:05	@evajrobins and £210 fitted for the Small one and £225 fitted for the Large
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-21 13:32:20	@cakesbykath Cool.  See you later model maker.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-21 14:42:45	@evajrobins I'd go for the small for better manoeuvre ability personally.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-23 18:02:32	@cyclingalong sure is! Be with you in about an hour.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-23 18:50:10	Remember this pile of gold scrap I tweeted the other day? http://t.co/tMSEG4QTrJ

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-24 18:09:49	@LucyPadfield @toolboxtan shouldn't be a problem. What size do you require?

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-26 07:54:44	Or it makes me a massive saddo...
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-26 09:23:22	@thatchrissywood not yet.... Am going to chase who I need to chase early next week. All looking good though!
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-25 07:02:12	@ClaudeBinns that's cool. I think I have @ChevetteE17 knog light and cable lock still attached to my Dutchie.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-10-25 12:18:33	@tcolmccormack @Blackhorsestow1 that's where @woodstcoffee and Andy Chair-dude used to be right?

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-03 07:03:17	As much as I love Walthamstow, it's definitely not Playa Villericos with 25 degrees and blue skies. Today will be a struggle.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-03 07:03:52	Also no food in the house. Workshop dogs food is looking appealing.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-03 07:50:56	@woodstcoffee on way. Put kettle on.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-03 09:21:58	I raise your headwind grimness @LairyGodmother I found this in the tea making area. http://t.co/QXzFs52nmk

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-09 16:11:29	.@ian_radioguy @stellacreasy might want to have a word with the Cowboys who laid the Tarmac as well.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-09 16:12:34	@stellacreasy @Labourstone the new road surfacing around Chapel End is certainly a joke.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-13 19:49:05	Was tough out there today... http://t.co/aMEEOBYobh
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-13 20:05:20	@Londoncarolyn it had a serious clean as soon as I got back. Was great fun, and Epping Forest is all beautiful and autumnal ant the moment.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-14 19:08:02	@sausman_marion I think we should ask @EmpireMFG for a price first.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-14 19:25:29	@sausman_marion mail me at WalthsmstowCycles@Live.com and we can discuss costs/delivery times etc

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-20 07:38:54	Coffee, banana, bike ride.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-20 07:03:20	@wynwoodartd yay! If it gets really dirty I'll just go home and pop in later.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-20 11:05:24	@Londoncarolyn was nice, but am now covered in road grime and can't feel my toes...

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-20 11:31:06	A lovely 43 miles around the Essex lanes this morning. However, the bike and myself are now covered in road grime, and I can't feel my toes.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-20 13:07:39	@aberdonianlad I kinda have one in my head, it's a 43 miler.  Will see if I can put in on a map.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-22 08:54:32	@Billtix my technique on a406 is to get on/off/on. I usually get on at Waterworks, off and back on at billet, off and back on at Cooks Ferry
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-22 08:55:07	@Billtix the slip roads are usually faster moving...

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-23 20:20:55	@meOMalley sure can.I'm sure @Philternz is happy to show you his if you want to see one first. Mail me if you want prices/sizes/availability

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-24 13:01:25	@Philternz @meOMalley here's the photo. Done 4 pads and a set of suspension forks http://t.co/N9nK2bwYHQ
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-24 18:37:06	@Philternz finding decent forks with a straight steerer, qr wheel and 26 inch wheels isn't that easy! Will be cheaper changing frames.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-23 16:06:51	@bature419 high chance! Collect tomorrow evening for return on Wednesday evening. Do you have Chainset and bb?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-23 16:09:19	Home. Just finished my first endurance race in ages in the worst weather conditions in ages. This is going to hurt come Monday morning.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-23 16:17:05	@bature419 what length arms and ring combo do you need?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-23 16:19:33	@bature419 last question... 11 or 10 speed rings?
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-23 16:25:01	@bature419 you're looking at £120 fitted, and both silver and black are available to me.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-23 16:37:07	@bature419 mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.co.uk and I'll get you booked in.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-23 19:53:53	@Philternz @meOMalley I think the Latitude will be my next winter bike. Great fun angles, good mud clearance and 27.5 wheels.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-24 07:05:14	E17 Cyclists: watch out this morning for car drivers who think it's acceptable just to clear a small patch of frost from the windscreens.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-24 07:06:11	It's also probably a good idea to have lights on and high vis this morning. Every little helps.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-24 10:09:03	@MouseyRussell @bushell had a chat with Tannus at the bike show.  Rubber is reasonably soft so gives good comfort.  About £100 a pair.

15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-30 11:44:53	To the Clio driver who came up and hooted at me whilst doing 25mph from behind this morning at Woodford Green/Walthamstow exit:
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-30 11:47:00	1) I was in the middle of the lane as it was safer. Last thing I need whilst negotiating a tight wet bend is a car on my inside/outside.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-30 11:48:56	2) speed limit is 30mph there, and I was in your way for 30 seconds. I therefore held you up for all 0.041 miles to ensure I was safe.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-30 11:51:31	3) A horn should only be used when warning someone of danger, not to indicate your annoyance at a manner of driving.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-30 11:52:11	Other than that car driver, I had a lovely rude this morning.
15231860	WstowCycles	2014-11-30 11:55:24	Lovely ride! Not rude. Well, I was a bit rude to that car driver... Put my finger on my lip #sssssshhhg

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-01 15:04:04	2 hours ago this was brand spanking new. It's now well used and knackered thanks to Epping mud. http://t.co/hnQptHDyZJ
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-01 15:39:41	@WalthamstowDad did you ever get your crack sorted?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-01 15:41:53	Hello @TheTippingTim my 800th follower. How are you and your bicycles?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-01 18:06:44	@Adams070369 it's now clean (ish)
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-02 19:52:12	RT @lordmanky: Back to training!! Got quite a bit of turkey to burn off...
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-03 11:06:08	@Adams070369 sure thing. I'm just fitting the Crud Catchers.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-03 11:09:09	@LairyGodmother I don't mind it to much. Quite like the music selection.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-03 14:31:56	@Adams070369 meeting a group 5/10 minutes away at 830am, so 840am?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-02 22:33:49	@Adams070369 broken bikes to fix, and a broke down motorbike.... Did you have a nice time?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-03 17:52:33	@Adams070369 is that clean, or less dirty?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-05 20:13:42	That moment when you put your tube of Lipbalm over the car heater, and then squirt warm Vaseline over your face by mistake. Yeah, that.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-06 07:58:08	All the best to @allyoureadlove opening today @PortfolioSpace in Leyton. I saw them working late into the last night getting it all setup.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-06 10:33:27	@caznthat do you hear the sound of a tiny mouse coming from the wheel when not pedaling?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-04 13:25:55	@PortfolioSpace sure thing! Mail me at WalthamstowCycles@Live.com and I'll book you in
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-06 10:39:57	@caznthat it's usually this seal that's dried out and moans. A drop of lube usually shuts it up. http://t.co/mlseqMYVMD
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-06 10:40:28	@caznthat whilst the lube is out, put some on the jockey wheels as well to make sure.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-04 13:45:54	@wynwoodartd why's Stella doing a Moonie?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-04 14:36:36	@Adams070369 just slammed down 12 meatballs.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-04 14:37:16	@Philternz a mental breakdown? Just yammed 12 meatballs down.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-04 14:37:53	@LairyGodmother like it. I shall call it the Upstream rug line @IKEA

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-04 18:18:46	Great ride over Epping Forest this morning. Conditions were horrid but had good company (and hopefully broke some bikes...)

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-06 10:31:51	@GreavsieE17 @caznthat Is it squeaking when pedaling or freewheeling?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-07 20:55:23	Sorry for the twitter silence, I've been fixing all the broken bikes so people can keep their New Year resolutions to cycle more.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-08 09:32:35	@Labourstone @wfcycling Racks on the Belle Vue Estate would be super handy! No racks up that way at all is there @carterwebs @cakesbykath ?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-08 11:00:26	@LairyGodmother how on earth do people roll a car in a 30 zone? Some people are f**king s**t at driving.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-08 11:12:16	@LairyGodmother that makes sense.  Hopefully they flipped the driver into jail as well.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-09 11:05:18	@goodwinphoto where's that boozer that you photographed for @TheEList_e17 on page 18? Looks delightful.

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-11 19:27:39	The irony is that MC Neat is actually quite messy. However, DJ Luck won £10 on the lottery in 2004.

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-30 15:18:03	@maschmidtwit 25c will be a bit more comfortable, but with the hard compund you'll feel the bumps.  25c also better at braking/cornering.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-30 15:18:27	@maschmidtwit but 25c will be a bit slower in straight lines.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-30 15:18:57	@HoltBe I'm going to be driving past you at about 830am if you want a lift over?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-30 15:38:51	@AnalogPuss @cyclingalong It's a early 00's bike from what I've seen.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-30 18:57:49	@awesome_owl13 @maschmidtwit shall I get some on order then?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-29 09:54:54	@motione17 I can have a look but the only spares I carry are tubes/tyres/brake cables.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-29 11:31:16	@maschmidtwit I'm a dealer over @bikeandrun so I can source tyres and can fit by hand. My installation machine is due next month.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-29 11:34:51	Carbon frame hacked open, so it could bend out of the lock and then then parts removed and sold :-( http://t.co/gPGoojfeex
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-01-29 13:01:12	@maschmidtwit what size, and colour would you like?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-02 10:45:44	The knee is better! Being able to walk this morning is a great sign. Going to up the mileage to a whopping 15 miles on Thursday.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-02 15:14:59	@maschmidtwit Gah... They don't make them in 25c, only 23c. Pair of Hard Musai Viola 23c tyres then?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-03 06:36:25	Careful pedestrians! As usual the roads have been salted but not the pavements.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-03 06:45:07	@PickleRah so us your best effort!
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-03 06:52:35	@PickleRah if I see one (or a 1000!) I'll bring a cuppa out.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-03 06:58:14	@PickleRah are the snow angels volunteers or council employed?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-03 07:06:39	Keep an eye out for 'The Snow Angels' gritting the pavements in E17 today. All unpaid volunteers, so give them a hot cuppa tea if you can!
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-02 15:37:39	@maschmidtwit very cool, I've got them here in front of me! I'm out collecting tomorrow eve for return Weds/thurs evening.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-03 08:12:19	@ian_stephens I'm sure @wfcycling will be able to point you in the right direction.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-01 11:34:46	Going out on my first ride in 4 weeks due to injury. I'm looking forward to being on the bike, no looking forward to being fat and slow.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-01 14:12:14	5 muddy miles and the knee is intact. Let's see how it feels in the morning.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-03 17:07:53	@maschmidtwit will be with you between 6pm and 7pm.  Will have to be a grab and dash as have 12 visits tonight!

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-04 11:57:05	Today I'm fitting solid @Tannustyres not easy to install, but once on they're a great bit of kit http://t.co/UFHa59q2EZ
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-01 16:28:18	@thatchrissywood not yet.... Hopefully have some this coming week (but have been saying that for 18 months...)
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-04 18:24:40	@maschmidtwit cool. Looking at my route I'll be with you between 8pm and 9pm.

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-04 13:53:04	@maschmidtwit @awesome_owl13 the yellow bits are the rim clips, once the tyre is installed you won't see them.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-04 22:04:30	@Foistmania thanks for the follow. Nice jelly mould you've got there.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-04 15:29:21	@LairyGodmother @Tannustyres not particularly.  Lighter than a Martahon Plus with tube.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-05 06:49:58	@Foistmania you've a nice selection of bikes! You still working at the same place?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-05 07:06:24	@parkerdairies yay! Mountain bike time!
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-05 07:11:15	@parkerdairies the wetter the better! A wet forest means the mud should shouldn't stick to the tyres as much.

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-05 19:06:19	@LairyGodmother @Tannustyres it's about £50 a tyre excluding fitting, they do grip very nice, and 700x40.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-05 19:19:10	@MarcusInE17 my phone is doing the same... iPhone 5 about 18 months old by chance?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-05 19:24:00	@Auntie_Maureen do you still do your vinyl nights/bring a record at the Nags? You could do a 'singles' night on the 14th ;-)
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-05 19:24:25	@MarcusInE17 time to cash in my O2 refresh I think.

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-07 14:50:35	@meOMalley get my mail about Swinley?

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-02-06 16:24:06	@LairyGodmother The thing is, the Marathons will puncture one day.... Will see if I can get a test set from @Tannustyres

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-04-30 09:53:23	@cyclingalong I meant he's now better looking.  Was never a fan either, but only started watching snooker in about 94/95
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-04-30 10:41:08	@stellacreasy  XFM or BBC6 music?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-04-30 10:44:38	@stellacreasy but if Spotify and others wasn't working, and you didn't have your cd/tape/vinyl/minidisc collection with you?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-04-30 13:00:15	@Krusty_Loaf @stellacreasy defo. She's very skilled at avoiding saying that though.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-04-30 09:47:35	@cyclingalong one the subject of the snooker, Stephen Hendry has improved with age don't you think?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-04-30 10:26:41	@Philternz Chalk I think is the answer, that way it washes away and the council don't have to spend money on paint removal.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-04-30 12:05:36	@MagsieWagsie nowhere locally I can think of.

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-05 20:11:17	@spudgun67 @RadioGibbon too much lube. Lube gets sticky, picks up road dirt and then acts like grinding paste all over your gears.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-05 20:12:01	@spudgun67 @RadioGibbon the secret to chain lubing is little and often. Always wipe excess lube off.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-07 07:39:39	@stellacreasy @psimonk I used to cut through the Village to avoid the lights at the top of the market. At best they let 4 vehicles through.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-07 09:20:39	@John_Ranson I hate Gulls as well.

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-13 13:35:07	@cyclingalong Think this is up by the waterworks and is a covered reservoir.  Think the photo is just stock image.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-13 14:05:09	@GreavsieE17 @cyclingalong According to various Facebook groups lots of police up at the Waterworks this morning.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-13 19:52:18	@GreavsieE17 @cyclingalong just drove past on the way home. Blue tarp of death at the top of Forest Road :-(

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-17 18:41:30	@cakesbykath like the fixed wheel? Perhaps get one to commute on?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-17 18:45:04	@CuriosE17 @6TownsMart anyway, you should collect bikes, not sell them (photo a fraction of personnel collection) http://t.co/ssXJroXGhz

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-17 18:08:31	@CuriosE17 @6TownsMart yeah... Sorry about that....
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-17 18:08:59	@cakesbykath @LeeValleyVP @goodwinphoto walk up or cycle up?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-17 19:05:12	Sunday night chilling on the sofa. Not a crap period drama in sight. http://t.co/tUyHwY2kpN
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-17 20:17:33	@Philternz that's because they all get a strip, clean and full service after each ride. I'm that sad.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-19 05:37:04	@parkerdairies perhaps @Billtix knows of somewhere?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-18 17:45:00	@CuriosE17 Steve shouldn't be to far away.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-18 18:37:19	@CuriosE17 how was Steve this evening for you?

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-05-31 10:52:33	Police Interceptors on C5.3 police cars and a helicopter to catch a stolen £1500 van. Does the same happen when a £1500 bicycle gets stolen?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-06-01 19:01:54	@eastofeden17 by baby, do you mean: (a) the mountain bike (b) the road bike (c) the motorbike (d) the van, or (e) the actual baby?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-06-01 20:48:49	@eastofeden17 we have. She's alright but currently going through a growth stage which mostly happens between 1am and 5am.

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-06-03 08:23:29	@sveinc I do, but a decent respray would be around £300... You could put that money towards something like this: http://t.co/9wOtRzZ8LD
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-06-03 08:25:21	@sveinc Armourtex in Hackney do single powderocats, or Argos Racing Cyclings, or CBR @CarbonRepairMan in Surrey will do amazeball jobs.

15231860	WstowCycles	2015-06-18 19:16:55	Sad bicycle planters/ground anchors in Wood St. I wonder what could have caused that type of heavy damage. http://t.co/7mkOXrpiep
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-06-18 19:42:41	@matsimpsk they are quite a heavy bike, so that's a good theory.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-06-18 14:32:46	@ClairehairE17 you're in!
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-06-18 09:21:58	@ClairehairE17 that's a bargain! If only I had 3 dads...
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-06-18 14:29:27	@ClairehairE17 not tonight. Back on the road on Monday.
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-06-18 14:51:44	@motione17 what's happened buddy? Do we need to group up and find you somewhere fast? @eastofeden17 possible share for a bit?
15231860	WstowCycles	2015-06-18 15:03:06	I've a 30m square garage, so I could sell it for about £140k yeah? http://t.co/z5G7ceU0qy
