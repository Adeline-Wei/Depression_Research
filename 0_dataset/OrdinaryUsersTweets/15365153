15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 16:17:38	@idebunkforme Macroevolution happens daily? I'd like to see it, sir.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 16:18:21	@littlebear3721 heck yeah he is.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 16:39:47	@idebunkforme Micro is an adaptation within species, macro is a species transforming into another.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 16:50:29	@idebunkforme Why are monkeys not still evolving into humans?
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 16:55:30	@idebunkforme What is the pinnacle?
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 17:02:27	@idebunkforme You never question why, then? Why did evolution begin, or how?
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 17:10:28	@idebunkforme Do you have an answer for how? How even the simplest cell, which are still unbelievably complex, could appear from nothing?
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 17:12:54	@ScarletAtheist Responses like that are fallacies. You attack me, which is hardly an answer to the question.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 17:14:18	@idebunkforme Who's to say it wasn't?
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 17:22:05	@idebunkforme If those cells were as simple as you say, can we create life without first having life?
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 17:30:38	@idebunkforme That is pretty fascinating, actually. Now, would those cells follow the course of nature and begin the process all over again?
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 17:31:08	@idebunkforme By that I mean, we could see those 99% of species you mentioned.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 17:43:05	@idebunkforme Shouldn't it, though, or something similar? Or am I merely being an ignorant Creationist?
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 17:50:38	@idebunkforme So conditions had to be exactly correct for billions of years to produce the amazingly complex beings we have today?
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 17:57:42	@idebunkforme But a Creator is out of the question?
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 18:06:51	@idebunkforme Believing in God does not make all other investigation defunct.  I'm inquiring right now, asking you about what you believe.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 18:14:02	@idebunkforme I can't claim to know the answer. It's beyond me to comprehend, and if that makes me stupid, so be it.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 18:16:55	@idebunkforme The same way you can claim to know the answer to the origin of life and all. Faith.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 18:21:46	@idebunkforme Can yours? Can Neo-Darwinism tell me beyond a shadow of a doubt how the universe came into existence and life began?
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 18:31:05	@idebunkforme Sorry, my fault. So, where did life on earth begin?
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 18:33:33	@idebunkforme Alright, then how? A brief summary will suffice.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 18:36:03	@idebunkforme Odd, you can't answer these questions either. Then evolution is, what? For clarity's sake.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 19:04:00	@idebunkforme As of right now, no definite answers. You have faith, though, that they will be answered in favor of evolution.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 19:04:58	@idebunkforme Look man, can we put this to rest? Neither of us is going to convince the other.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 19:10:06	@idebunkforme I understand just fine, but, your side is based in reality? You've said yourself there is nothing concrete, that we don't know
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 19:14:06	@idebunkforme Seeking answers. Something we both do, yet, when I searched, no explanation was plausible but that of an omnipotent creator.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 19:18:29	@idebunkforme How is it possible for life to begin from nothing? Where did the   matter in the BB come from? How do you know? (See?)
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 19:21:21	@idebunkforme But for now, you've merely got the "placeholder" of the Big Bang.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 19:23:21	@idebunkforme We don't know yet where God came from. He exists outside of this realm and outside of time. We know through Creation
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 19:23:32	@idebunkforme and His Words to us.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 19:41:32	@idebunkforme 2 Timothy 3:16 says "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching"
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-01 19:48:13	@idebunkforme I'm not sure I can. You utterly oppose the existence of a God and you'll just try to rationalize everything.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-02 00:17:26	@idebunkforme This is better than I could write it for you. http://t.co/e4v3L8yk
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-02 00:51:10	@idebunkforme Some other time, man. I have to finish this paper and write another four page paper before morning.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-02 00:58:06	@idebunkforme I hope you do. Obviously I'm not the best and brightest Creationism has to offer, being only 16.
15365153	areardon53	2012-04-02 01:18:53	Alright Research Paper, you win. 7 pages it is, deduction or not .#tooshort

15365153	areardon53	2012-05-01 02:53:32	I like to think of myself as a banana. I ripen well in the sun, but you shouldn't punch me too hard because I bruise easily.
15365153	areardon53	2012-05-02 23:57:32	And I just can't fight this feeling, that we're out of luck, and nothing more, a pound of dust, a holy war.
15365153	areardon53	2012-05-05 23:32:37	I jut took a six hour nap.

15365153	areardon53	2012-05-07 10:26:13	@TheHerrmann8r I know, ha, I thought it was the first thing though.
15365153	areardon53	2012-05-07 21:34:46	I'll give you nine guesses as to why they call me "Legs torn off by a warthog" Reardon.
15365153	areardon53	2012-05-03 01:16:03	@EricaKillian excuse me? Haha.
15365153	areardon53	2012-05-03 01:41:20	@EricaKillian I was just so depressed by what you said I couldn't think of anything but to ask your pardon...
15365153	areardon53	2012-05-03 01:47:52	@EricaKillian My God, that sounds... terrible. Can't say it hasn't been done to me before.

15365153	areardon53	2012-05-11 18:17:28	I guess just because there are two sinks right next to each other, it doesn't mean piss in one, wash hands in other? Whatever.
