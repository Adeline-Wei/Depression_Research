154646344	rebecca7654	2013-05-30 22:33:24	This time next year I'll be getting ready to go to America for 3 months!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-05-31 18:44:47	@JrAthletics @EilishMccolgan Have you ever tried any other events like sprints, hurdles or field?
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-05-30 23:26:32	I can't deal with the idea of getting up at 7
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-05-29 12:03:25	Driving lesson done instructor said I should be up to test standards in a couple of weeks
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-05-29 12:27:29	I wonder how many people I'll keep in touch with after summer
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-05-31 22:43:50	Got treated like a member of staff today in school it was strange
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-05-31 23:00:41	I need to sleep for a week
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-05-31 23:05:28	I feel really tired but I know the moment I try and go to sleep I'll get a boost of energy
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-01 09:29:35	Weights were involved in the session this morning, I was not happy about that
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-01 11:29:41	It's the 1st June which means 29 days till I go on holiday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-01 12:21:21	Anyone else keep forgetting they have an exam left
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-02 12:08:46	Need to study but my mum took me shopping and is now taking me for lunch
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-02 14:15:22	Wish I was doing higher PE again was such an easy subject
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-02 17:27:26	Haven't even looked at area 3 of belief and science yet or the means section of Buddhism
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-02 20:32:51	I really hope it's a good paper tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-02 20:38:37	Once tomorrow is over I can look forward to this weekend!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-02 22:20:45	I will be the happiest person if I never have to see you again!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-03 18:49:30	Good luck to everyone sitting higher PE tomorrow wish I was doing it again such an easy subject!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-03 23:05:09	I really want a long lie but no I have a driving lesson in the morning
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-03 23:09:37	I think it's really sad but I really wish I was doing the PE exam again this year
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-05 12:29:11	@Glasgow2014 got my laces and wristband through! Thanks http://t.co/BiukZikMMS
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-05 15:09:37	Trust it to start raining just as I'm going to training
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-05 18:44:51	No longer allowed to give blood
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-05 19:44:58	So excited for Saturday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-04 09:13:06	Driving lesson in 15 minutes the car is going to be roasting
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-04 11:07:05	Love this weather!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-04 12:31:42	Really happy about this weather if it stays like this for the next few months it will be great!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-07 20:09:24	I think watching world's scariest plane landings was a bad idea
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-07 21:12:25	I start painting my nails then get bored currently sitting with one hand done
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-03 07:12:41	I can't even remember what Kantian ethics and the euthyphro dilemma are obviously passing today
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-03 07:52:11	If you find higher PE difficult you have got no chance anyone could do it
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-04 12:37:34	Pump and combat tonight are going to be hell
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-04 12:51:29	My neighbours are camping in their front garden
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-04 13:13:13	I have tan lines on my legs from a few weeks ago
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-08 07:41:13	My mum's still drunk so my dad has to tale me to the gym
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-08 08:48:31	@CraigMuldoon I was just going for combat
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-08 08:50:02	Combat done!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-08 09:01:37	@CraigMuldoon I'm done and home
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-08 09:04:16	Sitting having breakfast outside this is unusual
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-08 10:12:07	Been trying to get rid of tan lines on my legs for the past few days they won't go away!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-08 10:17:32	Spending most of the day in the sun then party tonight!

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-04 23:30:23	@charlottec28 I think its linwood
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-05 21:41:37	Getting so excited for Cyprus now! Just sat and loomed at reviews and pictures on the apartments
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-05 21:56:08	Yeah I can't spell!  Looked not loomed in my last tweet
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-03 15:27:50	I am sorry but what were some of those questions about!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-03 15:28:52	Exams are done!!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-05 22:31:37	My mum and dad keep asking me if I'm okay I fainted its happened before I'm fine!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-03 17:30:11	I can now look forward to Saturday! No more exams or school!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-06 10:36:42	Everythings changing this year I'm finished school forever and it's the first time in 10 years I'm not going to Portugal
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-06 10:49:28	The lack of energy I have is horrible
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-09 09:55:29	I think I had the best night in a long time!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-09 13:34:49	Totally forgot people were writing on my arm last night and my uncle came in and was asking me who Andrew was I was pretty confused
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-09 14:02:25	I actually cannot wait until I am 18
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-06 16:17:49	Just got this delivered from @WYNC2013 didn't expect to get all of this! Thanks! http://t.co/NAzuMUJSlG

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-09 21:38:36	Feel like nikis mum making sure she's all prepared for her holiday tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-09 21:53:06	Oops I've burnt my legs
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-09 22:00:39	I really want to go back to America!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-09 22:05:29	Might try and convince my mum and dad to go back to New York
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-09 22:11:09	I'm looking out for her http://t.co/nSByWm7ddK

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-08 16:57:39	Straightening hair in this heat is horrible
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-08 16:58:43	@StephanieCxxx I won't don't worry haha
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-08 17:26:11	Lying on my bed to warm to get dressed

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-12 21:31:56	So because I have a sore throat and don't look right according to my mum she's decided I need to go to the doctors
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-12 21:32:49	My mum is so paranoid
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-12 21:35:12	@Kieranrankin95 thanks just my mum being paranoid I will be okay :) xx
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-12 21:40:48	I don't think going to training tonight was a smart decision either
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-10 21:30:13	The question is what do I wear to this competition tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-10 23:13:53	Managed to kick the door now lying crippled on the stairs
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-10 23:34:45	Okay I made it upstairs!

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-22 14:02:34	I'm running next Saturday the day before I go on holiday
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-22 14:03:36	I just cannot wait to be lying by the pool
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-22 14:07:04	I think I should go and get ready
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-22 18:44:28	My dad has been in a mood the full day said one word to him and he went mental at me
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-22 20:17:45	I really do love Michael buble
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-23 22:32:49	Going to end up throwing my phone off the wall!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-23 23:03:09	I'm really excited but I don't know why
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-23 23:53:27	I'm also looking forward to training
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-23 23:54:12	I'll probably wake up in a completely opposite mood
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-22 21:37:49	I need someone who's always going to be there for me
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-22 21:51:39	Every time I go on holiday I get more scared of flying
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-22 21:55:26	one thing I enjoy about flying is I always get a new perfume from duty free another is I get away from here!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-22 22:06:55	This so called 'supermoon' isn't anything special
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-23 10:32:22	This time in 7 days I'll be on my way to Cyprus!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-23 11:22:15	Will be 3 hours into my flight next week!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-23 13:06:21	I'll be in Cyprus this time next week!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-23 13:07:00	Think I'm a bit excited to go on holiday and get away from here
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-23 13:23:49	@MitchLomas I'm going to Paphos you?

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-25 21:55:31	Aberdeens pre-season training begins tomorrow cannot wait for the season to start! New season new start!

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-24 20:01:00	Normal is not something to aspire to its something to escape from
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-24 22:42:09	I got lost in morrisons today could only happen to me
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-24 23:01:23	This is the cutest picture of a baby I have ever seen http://t.co/Pud6sPvl29
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-26 21:28:48	My brother finished primary today! That's scary!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-26 21:32:23	Saturday I have a running competition competing in 4 events then I fly out to Cyprus on Sunday! Pretty good weekend I think
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-24 14:09:53	Need to find clothes for training
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-24 14:35:21	Wearing my team GB top for the first time in months
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-24 14:51:09	My brother has been in 5 minutes and literally emptied the fridge
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-24 15:18:52	@craigsteven97 yeah we are going to Cyprus! I think we are going to try and go back to Portugal in October

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-24 15:22:03	@craigsteven97 thanks have a good time in Portugal!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-24 21:33:09	I keep thinking of things I want to happen but I know they never will
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-24 22:56:20	Got my new season ticket for Aberdeen! still not happy I had to move seat
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-27 00:12:55	Trust is the hardest thing to gain but the easiest to lose
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-27 00:16:46	When I can't sleep I just go through everything I've done wrong and think how I've effected people and how I could change things
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-25 08:38:14	5 days till Cyprus!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-25 13:51:45	My friends come home from Malia tonight!!

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-25 20:32:11	My dads gave me in trouble for talking about Cyprus

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-27 15:06:05	Been looking after my brother for a few hours and I'm close to locking him in a cupboard most annoying little boy ever
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-27 15:22:28	Watching the Olympic opening ceremony again
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-27 15:43:39	This was 100% the best part of the opening ceremony in my opinion http://t.co/zWaakL2nCH
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-25 22:21:34	@AdamJamesKramer @CampAmerica69 I wanted to go this year but wasn't old enough

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-26 19:19:07	Wimbledon is strange this year
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-06-26 19:45:07	Close to crying at Waterloo road

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-02 19:45:41	The cocktail I just got is absolutely disgusting
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-03 09:40:04	It is hot! Might just move to Paphos
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-03 19:14:32	My brother is such a pain why can't he act normal rather than acting like a weirdo
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-03 20:20:36	I want to go to @FlairsBarPaphos
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-03 20:27:41	Can't wait for scuba diving on Friday

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-05 19:49:33	So scuba diving was amazing! Hopefully getting to go on a deeper dive next week
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-01 08:28:49	There is a women just down from me with no top on
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-01 10:15:01	I'm hungry need some lunch
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-01 11:36:37	Got free cherries earlier I'm now trying to find some more
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-07 16:19:18	I can't take this!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-07 16:43:01	I think this calls for a celebratory drink
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-01 19:50:26	there's a Flintstones bar!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-07 10:24:46	Was getting ready to go find somewhere to watch Murray then remembered I'm 2 hours in front so it doesn't start till 4 over here
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-07 10:32:57	I actually think my brother is coming home a different race
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-07 13:35:43	Yesssss Andy!!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-07 15:17:23	Need to go out for dinner but don't want to miss the tennis
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-07 16:41:15	Would also like to point out Murray is Scottish!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-07 16:49:27	When Andy climbed up to see his family and coaches I thought he was going to propose to his girlfriend
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-07 18:29:33	I think every single bar in Cyprus erupted when Murray won
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-08 10:29:47	@andy_murray how did it feel picking up the Wimbledon trophy? #askandy
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-02 09:34:00	Going scuba diving on Friday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-02 12:38:50	Definitely warmer here than Portugal
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-02 17:17:29	I should be at body pump and combat just now it's sad how much I miss doing any sport or fitness classes

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-17 10:30:09	I can remember how to drive just not how to do any of the 3 maneuvers. Yeah this lesson isn't going to go well today
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-17 12:51:03	Need to get myself a new pair of gym shoes @adidasUK or @Nike decisions?
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-17 14:55:55	Driving lesson was pretty good!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-18 11:51:52	Extremely close to locking my brother in a cupboard
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-18 12:12:48	I'm in even more pain today than I was in yesterday from Tuesday
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-18 13:53:50	@RunActive Citius Altius Fortius whic means Faster higher stronger #adidasboost
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-18 13:54:04	"@RunActive: A brand new colourway of the women's Energy boost now available at RunActive Leigh! http://t.co/fR3lTxgoCW" I want these!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-18 13:54:50	I need new running shoes!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-18 13:55:14	My current ones are about to start falling apart!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-18 14:40:40	105 days!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-18 15:26:33	Training starts in 4 minutes and I'm in my house...think I'm going to be late
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-20 15:14:20	This train is roasting!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-21 12:38:17	I think my mum sees my friends more than me
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-21 12:54:54	I'm bored need something to do
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-21 15:44:11	This time last week I was on the flight from hell
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-21 20:30:41	If I ever get a job in the Nike store I will be the happiest person ever!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-18 20:02:56	Having a cold shower after the gym was probably the best decision ever
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-21 22:54:34	Training in the heat again tomorrow and it's not going to be an easy session!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-19 22:47:59	Today I tried to do a one handed cartwheel for the first time in ages, I'm convinced I've damaged something
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-22 09:20:07	Trains are cancelled! Bus it is then!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-22 13:18:35	Went to the Nike store bought a pair of shorts but just realised they are the wrong size back to the Nike store I go
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-19 14:05:07	My gran is up visiting! Not seen her in ages! I love my wee gran!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-19 14:16:43	Town tomorrow!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-20 23:14:30	I go through stages when I just don't want to talk to anyone for a couple of days! Strange!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-20 23:16:22	@StephanieCxxx aww good I'm not the only one!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-20 23:21:17	@StephanieCxxx yeah I'm the same or I just can't be bothered dealing with anyone!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-20 23:22:35	We use to talk all the time tell each other everything and now nothing! What happened!?
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-20 23:24:50	I guess we just drifted apart
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-20 23:26:11	I'm extremely close to killing my neighbours!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-20 23:28:35	@StephanieCxxx exactly the same as me
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-20 23:51:34	Finally found new running shoes!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-22 15:40:45	Thanks scotrail for canceling all the trains to and from east kilbride
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-22 23:09:18	Next time the trains are all cancelled I'm going back to my bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-22 23:11:59	Got my shorts sorted at the Nike store how I managed to buy a medium instead of an extra small I'll never know
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-22 23:17:49	@_lauramckechnie aww that's such a wee shame! :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-22 23:27:41	Exactly one year until the 2014 Commonwealth Games!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-23 21:55:41	I wish I was still in Cyprus!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-23 22:17:02	After tonight I'll be crawling round the running track tomorrow at training!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-23 22:20:26	I can now look forward to this weekend! 18th Party!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-23 22:32:30	Also means I'll get to see everyone this weekend!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-23 10:35:06	I really want my driving lesson cancelled. I don't want to driver in this
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-23 12:58:03	I just saw an advert on tv for Christmas! It's July!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-23 13:27:14	Hate that the weather is just rain for the next week
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-23 13:27:50	I'm scared for this driving lesson don't know why though
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-24 11:22:22	Wonder what my mum would say if I asked her if I could fly out to Portugal next week
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-24 15:06:49	Basically live on these http://t.co/tAs34AzHuk
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-25 10:44:38	Thought today was Friday slightly disappointed it's not
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-25 11:16:12	Aberdeen are playing FC Twente on Friday that's just going to be embarrassing for us
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-25 11:47:32	Today is one year since the opening ceremony for the London Olympics!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-25 11:50:05	Since when could you sit your driving test in east kilbride I'm doing mine in Hamilton!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-25 11:51:22	Would much rather do mine in east kilbride!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-25 12:18:36	@mark_stringer88 there's a new test centre
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-25 13:18:02	My brothers room is a hazardous zone
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-25 14:05:39	My gran is getting moved hospital at some point today!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-25 14:38:10	Right I can't find my new football season ticket!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-25 14:56:55	So...it's raining
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-25 15:15:01	There's never any food in my house!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-24 17:19:50	Okay I need to get my hands on a pair of nude/beige shoes for Saturday
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-26 10:44:38	"@linekerspaphos: Paphos is hot today Its hitting 39 degrees ouch !!!" Why am I home!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-26 14:46:56	One thing I hate about parties is finding something to wear!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-26 18:36:53	Time for the London Anniversary Games!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-26 21:31:49	Half 10 and I'm in my bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-26 23:02:44	My gran is getting out of hospital tomorrow!!! :) can't wait to see her!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-24 17:46:09	And my Twitter feed is full of people saying the royal baby's name
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-27 10:06:48	I also found my season ticket my dad had it! Just need to get my hands on the new top!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-27 11:28:11	Need to charge my camera
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-26 20:45:47	Time for Bolt!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-28 11:10:23	Dad thought I had a running competition today if I did I would not have been capable of running
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-28 14:03:40	I have the best relationship with my bed!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-28 17:01:24	Currently look like I have a bird's nest on my head my hair is an absolute mess!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-28 17:02:13	So after missing a full week of training I'm back tomorrow and it's going to be horrible
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-24 23:24:28	Last time I done a 400m I said I'd never do it again but at my next competition I'm doing a 400m and a 4×400m relay
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-24 23:28:04	So a 100m, 400m and 4×400m relay oh this is going to be interesting
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-24 23:36:40	My mum just phoned me from the hospital to say my gran has had a heart attack. I saw her a few days ago and she was fine!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-24 23:38:28	The hospital are looking after her now wish I was at the hospital with her! :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-24 23:55:41	Now do I try and sleep or stay awake in case my mum phones again
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-24 23:58:32	@StephanieCxxx thank you! She's a strong wee lady! Hopefully she will be fine xxxx
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-28 19:33:10	This week will probably be the week from hell
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-26 23:03:16	Right need to go to bed I'm getting up at 8!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-28 20:36:53	Sitting watching harry potter oh how exciting my life is
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-27 09:30:10	This time next week I'll be in Aberdeen!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-27 10:08:06	My dad decided to hire a dual control car for 2 hours today! Someone help me he stresses me out when I'm driving!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-27 18:01:15	I think I should start getting ready
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-28 21:47:52	Not long till I can apply for @CampAmerica69 next summer is going to be great!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-28 22:21:53	I think my mum's booking Portugal for October tomorrow!!! :)
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-29 09:55:49	@KatieeLarsen really? :D
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-29 10:07:57	@KatieeLarsen Aww yeah I don't have any idea what dates we are going
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-29 11:27:16	Wonder when I'll get my letter from @CofGcollege
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-29 11:32:54	Training in this weather is going to be interesting
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-29 11:41:58	@CofGcollege I've got a place on the Hnd sports coaching course
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-29 11:54:37	I want to go back to my bed and sleep!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-29 14:13:37	Might need to look out a waterproof for training
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-29 14:22:41	Officially a sports student! http://t.co/gnzO57y5mv
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-29 17:26:56	@Kieranrankin95 is your induction the 19th?
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-29 19:42:10	@Kieranrankin95 ahh okay :)
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-29 20:05:53	I might just have bought a few things from adidas
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-29 20:07:30	Adidas clothes just ruin my bank balance!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-30 11:39:25	My phone contract ends the day of the exam results so I won't be getting my contract renewed then!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-30 14:03:05	I know I'm just back from a holiday but I seriously cannot wait until October to go back to Portugal!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-30 19:42:35	Oh right
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 13:47:29	@AmeriCamp application complete just need to get my references done and that's me!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 13:54:38	So gutted @J_Ennis won't be at worlds! It's what's best though! Her Achilles needs time to heal!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 14:09:47	@AmeriCamp days going great! Thanks I can't wait! How's your day? x
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 15:17:08	My mum's words I'll be home in time so you're not late for training and there's no sign of my mum
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-02 10:13:34	I need a new left foot
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-02 12:56:37	Had another attempt at making pancakes and nearly set the kitchen and my brother on fire
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-02 22:56:30	Wish my foot would stop hurting in constant pain
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-02 23:02:38	Should really sleep up in just over 7 hours
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 20:27:24	@AmeriCamp hide some biscuits around hq and have people race each other to get the most!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 20:33:46	@AmeriCamp might make a trip to Manchester for a wee game then haha x
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 21:01:27	@TheRealSamDiego @AmeriCamp yeah we could! Would be great!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 22:18:50	I'd really like an @americamp hoody they look so comfy I'd wear it all the time!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 22:22:48	@AmeriCamp they do look so comfy! x
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-30 19:49:16	When I watch CSI New York I end up shouting at the screen when I see a place I walked by or went to
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-30 23:12:52	I feel like I've broken a bone in my foot it's agony!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-30 23:47:37	1 day till I can apply for @CampAmerica69
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-01 00:06:27	I'm convinced there is someone outside my window!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-30 23:58:15	Also the football season starts on Saturday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-30 23:59:31	I'm looking forward to being back at Pittodrie! I miss Aberdeen
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-01 13:29:35	Right delivery man I would be happy if you could get here before I go out!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-01 13:57:33	I'm a wee bit concerned about my foot
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-01 14:24:29	Time for my driving lesson can't be bothered
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 11:03:51	Got a phone call from @AmeriCamp today
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 14:51:42	Sitting half dressed because I can't find a top for training! :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 15:19:01	I think I broke snapchat on my phone :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 20:28:38	All my new adidas clothes are getting delivered tomorrow!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 21:12:20	@AmeriCamp @TheRealSamDiego yeah a biscuit race round Manchester!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-01 00:49:42	Why am I still awake!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-01 21:35:12	My foot feels worse :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 20:29:33	It's sad how excited I get about new sports clothes!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 20:53:55	@AmeriCamp thank you so much! x
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 20:58:01	@TheRealSamDiego @AmeriCamp loads of people racing round for biscuits!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-07-31 23:58:56	Pretty sure I won't be able to get out of bed in the morning every muscle hurts
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-03 11:16:11	In Aberdeen just need to get my hands on the new strip!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-03 17:39:56	This car journey from Aberdeen is so boring!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-01 22:24:37	It's going to be weird not sitting in the upper deck of the Richard Donald stand on Saturday been moved to a different stand!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-01 22:25:40	Apparently people didn't mind moving and having the upper deck closed but every person I spoke to who sat there didn't want to move!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-01 22:28:24	Highlight of tomorrow will be making pancakes
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-01 22:37:51	@euan_watson Aberdeen at the end of august I'm sure!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-01 22:39:54	When did the SPL change to the SPFL?
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-01 22:45:05	@iFinishedLast was on the Aberdeen website and it said SPFL was a bit confused! Thanks haha
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-01 22:53:57	@iFinishedLast ahh right and I thought I knew about football! haha

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-01 23:55:28	2 spiders thought they could come into my room they are now dead!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-02 00:11:20	My room is roasting!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-02 10:46:25	Just tried to make pancakes and nearly set the kitchen on fire
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-02 21:27:35	No idea how to start my @AmeriCamp video :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-03 23:43:31	2 days left on my phone contract and I have no time to get it renewed
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-03 23:46:47	Might see if my dad can get it done tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-03 23:53:41	Next door neighbours are having a party this means I won't be getting to sleep anytime soon :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-03 08:13:01	In Dundee I'm so tired
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-02 09:51:10	No idea what's going on with my foot but it hurts even more today
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-03 15:53:14	2-1 Aberdeen! We could have had more goals some really good chances!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-03 06:38:14	Need more sleep
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-02 21:51:30	Up at half 7 for the trip to Aberdeen tomorrow!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-02 21:56:12	Dreading running on Sunday
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-02 22:11:59	I need to film and edit a video 2 things I have never done before this is going to be a challenge
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-04 19:29:14	I like the new Aberdeen away kit!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-03 21:06:46	@charlottec28 I like this plan!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-03 20:45:14	Super Saturday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-04 00:20:18	Seriously don't have the energy for this running competition
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-04 00:21:26	I am really worried about my foot though
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-04 21:40:43	Watching sportscene so I can see the Aberdeen highlights!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-04 22:16:31	dreading majority of this week!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-04 22:37:51	Sounds like my neighbour is cutting the grass
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-04 08:38:00	Going to curl up in the tent today and sleep
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-04 18:24:07	So annoyed with my run today!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-04 18:24:24	Running with an injury probably wasn't the best thing to do
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-04 17:47:03	I always get burnt at Linwood!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-04 22:50:31	I have never felt so tired before
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-05 10:36:52	I want to go to the airport get on a plane and fly somewhere there is no internet
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-05 11:17:53	Driving lesson today I never have a lesson on a Monday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-05 13:28:32	My foot is getting worse it now hurts when I drive and when I walk
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-05 22:15:01	I feel so sick
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-05 23:00:02	Oh god
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-05 23:01:34	Just going to jump out my window....bye everyone!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-05 23:03:37	My results were sent out at 20 past last year
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-05 23:11:22	Got an email....it was from twitter
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-05 23:47:13	The sqa always make a mistake when sending out the emails/texts
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-05 23:58:07	@laurenbruce16 it says we should have them by 9 so I'll get mine at 8:59
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 00:04:13	Got my results last year at 20 past 12 and the year before at quarter past 1
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 00:05:38	@laurenbruce16 if I don't get my email I'll be waiting till 2 for my postman! Why can't they just be sent out now!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 00:16:27	@laurenbruce16 oh god! People have started getting emails! Lauren help!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 00:20:10	@laurenbruce16 so far it's the year below!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 00:20:35	@laurenbruce16 and people who have sat standard grades as well
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 00:22:51	I was really nervous then I calmed down but now people are getting their results I'm nervous again!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 00:26:52	Right people in my year have got their results!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 00:30:43	@laurenbruce16 jade got hers
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 00:32:10	Going to end up in hospital my heart is going so fast!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 00:36:18	I've had a really good summer sadly this is going to change in the next few hours
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 00:58:11	More people in my year getting their results I'll be last I know it
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 01:09:26	How can waiting for one email make me feel like this! I'm sitting shaking and my heart is going so fast!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 01:11:37	The sqa should send the emails out in a certain order and give us a rough time of when we are getting them
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 01:23:09	This is an absolute joke!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 01:55:02	My email decided not to work I got my email 2 hours ago!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 02:06:21	Jumping out the window does seem the best option right now!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 02:06:44	I know I said it earlier but it is
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 02:44:50	Right.....
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 11:58:28	I see my postman

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 19:04:42	I think today it sunk in that I'm not going back to school and I'm not going to see my friends all the time!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 19:57:45	Getting to see my gran on Thursday! Not seen her since before she had her heart attack
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-06 21:46:21	Mum's not letting me train tomorrow because of my foot

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-08 11:02:33	Why are football tickets so expensive!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-10 14:28:52	Another athlete tested positive for banned substances and the athlete is in the same training group as Tyson Gay.
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-10 14:37:16	Hate doing Avon with an absolute passion my mum says I can stop doing it if I want then the moment I want to stop doing it she goes mental!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-10 15:21:01	My neighbour just gave me a card for passing my driving test she's so cute!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-10 15:23:47	Come on MO!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-10 15:26:22	There's a guy in the background crawling across the track
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-08 09:56:13	Been awake for the past hour but can't find the energy to get out of bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-08 11:17:48	I should probably think about getting dressed!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-10 18:19:42	I really don't think I can deal with my brother at the football tomorrow so I'll just sit in a different section of the stand!

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-11 22:34:26	I'm missing the game though I'll be in Inverness!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-11 22:35:13	@mark_stringer88 it's hard enough getting parked at Pittodrie when they aren't playing Celtic

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-13 22:02:22	@Lauren_dickx aww really? I have a feeling mine will be there for years haha
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-13 22:09:56	@Lauren_dickx aww! I've still got my badge on mine I'd lose it otherwise haha
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-14 22:10:12	I think a trip to the physio is in order
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-14 23:56:50	This is beyond a joke now!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-13 21:46:46	My school tie is still hanging on my door handle I feel like I should be getting up tomorrow and putting it on
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-13 22:14:09	Bought my tickets for the hearts game today!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-13 22:31:05	I'm a wee bit jealous of people going into 6th year it's by far the best year!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-16 13:39:59	103 miles left

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-17 18:18:51	So yeah I had to stand outside on the Inverness main street in my jammies!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-17 18:33:34	There was a group of guys busking today and they were amazing!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-14 14:06:14	Think I'm doing long jump at training tonight this will probably end with a broken ankle
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-17 23:09:09	I'd rather get the train home from Inverness tomorrow than sit in a car for 3-4 hours!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-14 14:03:11	Wonder how my brother got on at his first day of high school
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-14 17:49:48	Yeah so my foot is messed up
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-14 23:46:43	Would be great if I woke up and my foot was back to normal and pain free
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-15 13:47:58	don't think I can deal with the drive to Inverness tomorrow

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-18 12:56:22	On my way home from Inverness it's been a good weekend!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-19 09:08:37	Nobody is talking!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-08-19 13:05:28	In college from 9-5 on a Monday and Thursday off Tuesday and Wednesday then in for 3 hours on a friday

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-12 17:44:44	Getting my car a day early! Getting it on Saturday now!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-13 06:32:15	@Lauren_dickx really!? That seems so pointless!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-13 07:57:58	One of the exam invigilators is sitting across from me at the station....
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-13 07:59:09	Right she didn't even know how to buy a ticket for the train!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-13 10:50:37	@Lauren_dickx is that for a class?
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-13 10:55:03	I'm so excited for tomorrow!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-13 10:55:28	@Lauren_dickx aww okay :)
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-12 23:02:20	4 weeks till I go on holiday!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-12 23:06:32	3 hour days are so pointless!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-12 23:09:48	Also I'm going to be walking through town and going on the subway wearing shorts oh I'm going to get some funny looks on my way home
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-13 17:25:03	Everyday that goes past I get more nervous about not having an interview for the commonwealth games yet :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-13 19:33:37	I want a sports leadership class reunion it was the best class ever and I really miss it!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-13 20:46:30	My dad has bought me a student ticket for the game tomorrow so I now need to take my student card to the game definitely going to lose it!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-11 12:55:41	I dread going to training every week because I know my foot is going to hurt the moment I attempt to sprint
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-11 13:19:10	guessing I'll be looking out the long running tights and long sleeved tops for tonight!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-11 15:09:52	RIP to everyone who lost their lives on 9/11
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-11 15:18:12	This is the last time I need to get a lift to training. I'll be driving myself there next week!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-11 15:35:02	I seriously think Scotland has skipped autumn and went straight to winter! It's so cold!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-11 17:38:26	Yeah so falling at training tonight wasn't my best moment!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-11 20:49:23	I hate looking out clothes for college it was so much easier wearing a school uniform everyday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-14 11:32:46	I just drove on my own for the first time! It wasn't that bad
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-14 13:23:19	That ks Patrick thistle for giving me and my dad tickets for seats that don't exist!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-14 21:36:17	Today has been a good day!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-14 22:41:03	I've not seen any of my friends in ages!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-15 09:22:51	This weather is horrible! So happy I don't need to leave my house today!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-15 20:03:37	It was 33 degrees in carvoerio today! I really can't wait until I'm there!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-15 20:11:28	Of all the instruments my brother could learn to play he is learning the trombone! Why could it not have been the guitar or something else!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-15 22:38:18	Really wish I could have a long lie tomorrow!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-17 09:27:22	Being a good daughter and driving my mum to the shops!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-17 12:05:53	The question is do I go to the gym tonight!?
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-17 12:14:33	I constantly have the feeling that I'm letting people down!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-17 12:41:33	Ehh what!? Some weird people on this! http://t.co/x5N9FHBQRx
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-17 16:13:48	The young ambassador tops for this year aren't as nice as last years wish I was still a young ambassador met some nice people!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-18 13:11:22	My running spikes are in my mum's car and she's at work I think I have a problem then!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-16 15:17:38	I have my big winter jacket on and I'm still freezing!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-16 15:17:38	Finished early again!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-16 15:21:13	On the train and there is a guy wearing yellow latex gloves oh right!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-16 16:18:26	Just attempted to go up my driveway and almost ended up in my neighbours garden!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-17 21:06:30	What's the chance I see people from school on this crazy beaches programme considering it's in malia!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-16 18:22:28	Theres no food in my house :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-16 18:54:59	It's good knowing that things are getting better!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-16 20:12:50	Seriously thought I had broken my wrist today
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-19 15:58:15	Absolutely soaking! Hate the rain!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-19 16:10:40	Finished! Only 3 hours tomorrow!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-19 18:04:18	I could sleep for a week or two
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-19 20:44:37	I don't text you because I feel like I'm annoying you!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-19 20:46:55	The fact I get an extra 30 minutes in bed tomorrow makes me happy!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-19 21:14:03	I JUST WON A SIGNED COPY OF USAIN BOLTS NEW AUTOBIOGRAPHY!!!!! OMG!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-19 21:14:24	@BTSport @WiltshireRam @usainbolt thank you so much!!!! Ahhhhhh
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-19 21:23:32	No idea how that just happened!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-19 22:25:10	I really want to go Subaru diving again!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-19 22:25:30	Wonder if I'll get to do it in Portugal!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-20 06:12:07	3 weeks till Portugal!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-20 06:42:58	3 hour day!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-20 12:30:32	This train is an absolute sauna!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-20 13:44:57	Today was pretty good
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-20 15:22:32	Might be getting to do my exercise to music course! Then I can do my body combat course!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-20 15:54:28	This time in 3 weeks I'll be in Portugal!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-20 19:40:19	Best part of today was when the lecturer went "boys sometimes you just need to lock it away"
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-18 19:13:57	Forgive and forget
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-18 09:56:00	Going back to my primary today to coach netball!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-18 21:51:26	So it turns out my foot isn't better I found that out tonight when I attempted to sprint!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-20 21:55:44	Aberdeen tomorrow! Looking forward to seeing some of my family!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-23 21:34:58	Being off Tuesday and Wednesday is like having another weekend!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-23 22:20:03	If my mum wakes my up before 9 tomorrow I won't be happy
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-19 06:38:05	Guarantee I'll end up sleeping on this train!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-19 09:56:06	Really need this class to fly in!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-21 17:09:19	Just over an hour or so till I'm home!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-21 19:42:32	They obviously weren't best friends
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-24 18:19:05	@33_gemma I plan on organising a visit to see you!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-25 12:35:54	Ordered my sports kit 5 weeks ago and got told I would have it in around 2-3 weeks and I still don't have it
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-25 13:02:07	36 days till my birthday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-22 22:37:33	Really hope I get a call from @AmeriCamp this week to organise my interview!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-26 17:32:23	@JrAthletics that would be so good!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-25 23:11:34	I'm up in just over 6 hours!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-25 23:37:02	This is my last day of college till next Thursday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-26 21:05:02	Today wasn't the best but there's always tomorrow I guess :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-26 22:39:28	Oh right...... I don't really know what else to say :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-26 22:50:01	I think going to sleep is the best option right now!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-26 05:47:01	Today needs to fly in!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-26 23:13:23	Decided I'm basically staying in my house until Thursday and not leaving
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-26 23:23:40	I haven't trained this full week :( then again my foot is feeling better so I can hopefully get back into it next week!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-23 08:57:13	Full marks in my first assessment!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-23 14:48:12	Love early finishes!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-26 14:46:28	I feel so sick
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-26 15:04:11	When I go on holiday in 15 days I might just not bother coming home
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-27 11:04:02	Scared to leave my phone in a different room incase I miss my phone call from @AmeriCamp
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-27 11:22:49	@AmeriCamp got my phonecall just need to sort out my returning date and my interview can be arranged! x

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-23 17:06:22	I'm liking this week off tomorrow and Wednesday in Thursday then off on Friday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-27 15:16:09	This time in 2 weeks I'll be in Portugal!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-27 15:21:50	First indoor league match is the 15th December! Can't wait till I run in the emirates arena again!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-27 15:43:53	@mrleemcateer I'm goodbthanks! How are you?
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-27 15:48:22	@mrleemcateer sounds good! I'd love to go to Australia. Don't  have any plans so the weekend! Yeah I'm hoping to do @AmeriCamp
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-27 15:54:19	@mrleemcateer @AmeriCamp @AusJob okay thanks! I'll have a look! Will definitely be America first! Hopefully x
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-23 20:39:17	Feel like I'm constantly being judged by other people
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-29 22:21:57	Thinking how great next summer could be if I get a place at a summer camp in America! Would probably be the best summer ever!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-29 22:28:17	Spending like 3 months in America would just be amazing!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-29 22:38:04	This will be my view in 12 days! http://t.co/NRgFnectlP
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-01 11:52:41	Was going to film my application video outside but the builders at my neighbours are really loud!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-01 12:14:50	I don't know who I can trust anymore
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-01 13:48:23	So filmed my application video but the audio is out of time
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-27 19:23:54	My mum said she will be home by 7 yeah it's almost half 8
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-28 13:21:51	Wonder how long it will be until my signed @usainbolt book arrives from @BTSport
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-28 13:41:05	Weird not having football today
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-27 21:16:24	Thinking that this time in 2 weeks I'll be sitting in hemmingways in Carvoerio
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-27 21:39:21	I'm such an idiot!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-27 22:43:43	I'm so close to breaking
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-01 16:33:12	10 days till I go on holiday and 30 days till I'm 18!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-01 16:35:53	Also finished and edited my application video!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-01 18:38:44	All my mum does is shout at me and moan at me saying how useless I am and how I don't do anything
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-01 18:39:08	Well I'm sorry I'm not perfect and can't do everything the way you want me to
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-01 20:18:35	Just applied for about 10 jobs
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-30 20:07:03	1000 Aberdeen fans at the game tonight!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-28 21:26:43	Just had to deal with 2 massive spiders! @NikiGilmour wasn't much help
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-28 21:34:35	Think I'm going to check into a hotel tonight or something this spiders situation ain't good!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-02 10:49:26	I'm looking forward to training today!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-30 23:10:42	Going to be spending most of today filming my application video for America!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-30 23:56:49	No more football games for me until the 19th
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-09-29 11:40:44	Things are moving forward with my application for America next summer! So excited!

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-02 21:44:28	Absolutely screwed for this assessment tomorrow!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-04 18:40:09	I want to go out on my birthday but my problem is I have a sports session to take the following morning!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-05 14:45:00	I'm sorry but how does a referee get injured they are doing a light jog at most!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-05 17:08:43	Aberdeen need to get themselves sorted after we played Ross county last season everything went downhill for there it can't happen again!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-05 17:24:03	It's 29 degrees in carvoerio this full week! Hopefully stays like that!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-06 15:16:42	5 days left till I go on holiday seriously can't wait!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-06 23:35:44	I really can't deal with it
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-07 09:14:27	I'm sorry but doing the bleep test was not what I wanted to do first thing on a Monday morning!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-03 19:01:48	I can't wait until I get my interview for @CCUSAUK
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-03 22:48:50	3 hour day tomorrow!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-03 23:06:05	I go on holiday a week today!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-07 11:37:48	Could really go having a wee nap right now

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-04 18:43:50	Or do I just wait and go out the following night!?
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-05 18:40:07	My gym membership has finally been sorted can't wait to go back on Monday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-06 12:38:44	The amount of exercise I'm doing this week is unbelievable!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-06 23:33:34	I'm worried I might have the bleep test today because we have done all the other fitness tests apart from that one :(

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-30 21:46:03	Think I need a lie down
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-31 17:43:14	Hampden is being closed after the friendly against the US on November 15th @RedRevolution2
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-31 17:50:39	Semi final against st Johnstone! Should be good!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-01 08:45:02	Hate wearing my hair up
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-31 23:24:31	If I didnt have 2 assessments tomorrow I would have definitely gone out!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-03 14:54:38	Enjoyed today at the Emirates getting to help the children at their first ever competition!  Dreading the pictures though!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-10-31 00:04:48	@hailielawsonx thank you x
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-01 13:44:58	So they cancel a train then the next train is 2 carriages meaning it is so crowded
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-01 13:50:27	This train is packed but its so quiet
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-01 09:25:26	First time ever ive not had anyone beside me on the train
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-01 18:08:19	Today has been good and im really looking forward to tonight
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-01 16:41:36	Find it weird saying I'm going out tonight
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-01 18:10:10	Its horrible what happened at la airport!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-03 23:19:42	Ive said this before but trust is the hardest thing to gain and the easiest thing to lose....
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-03 23:21:26	Im 1st to do my presentation tomorrow finally gettting it done and wont need to worry about it anymore
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-02 09:27:30	Find it strange not having football on a Saturday end up with nothing to do
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-02 13:51:43	Going to the Emirates tomorrow!  Not running though just helping some of the younger athletes who haven't taken part in a competition
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-02 14:06:36	I keep listening to the same song over and over
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-02 16:03:06	Would really appreciate if dundee United didn't win today the same with st Johnstone
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-04 16:08:37	So happy I passed that presentation!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-04 17:20:50	Basically walk in the door and my brother has already annoyed me
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-04 08:30:14	Cant wait until my timetable changes and theres no more of this fitness testing first thing in the morning
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-04 18:53:15	Why is he not starting with Vernon!!

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-05 13:42:51	Im sorry £29 for the celtic game they are having a laugh
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-05 13:45:00	Or £26 if I want a restricted view and can only see parts of the pitch
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-05 13:47:55	@mark_stringer88 maybe they will surprise me and win
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-05 16:14:20	Why is there an ice cream van going around the streets its absolutely freezing
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-06 13:47:58	Think I might get away with 3/4 length leggings tonight rather than full ones for training
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-06 14:48:36	Left the house without a waterproof its now raining always happens
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-06 16:16:01	Bad decision on my part should always pick long leggings over short ones for training
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-06 16:20:59	Please please please be a nice session.....my thoughts before every session
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-06 19:15:39	I worry so much
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-06 20:42:19	Think the guy on sky is watching a different game from me
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-06 21:59:31	Tomorrow is not going to be a good day I hate Thursdays
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-07 02:08:42	Im over thinking things way to much
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-07 07:34:46	So much for saying I was running pain free im now in pain when I walk this is getting beyond a joke now! :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-07 18:04:00	I like when things are simple it makes everything so much easier! :)
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-08 08:06:03	Really want an early finish today
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-08 11:46:15	Looks like we might be getting an early finish!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-10 17:29:45	Gravity is such a good film!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-07 19:16:28	Tell them all I know now shout it from the roof tops
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-10 20:13:36	Love how everything is always my fault
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-07 21:05:54	Think I need a new body
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-07 21:26:44	So many Christmas adverts on tv already!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-10 21:51:51	Finally going to see a physio about my foot!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-10 22:16:00	I should hopefully be getting an email with really good news tomorrow!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-08 22:00:48	I wish people would actually find out the full story before jumping to conclusions!

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-11 12:49:40	Today is the most pointless day ever
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-11 14:13:45	Staying home would have been a better choice today
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-11 14:20:17	Think I spent in total 30 minutes in a class today
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-09 09:11:45	First time in ages I haven't slept on my way to Aberdeen
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-11 19:57:53	For some reason I am really hyper
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-11 22:39:43	So happy I'm off tomorrow and I can have a long lie
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-12 00:08:02	Got my acceptance email from @CCUSAUK

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-09 18:27:39	Cant wait until I get home and I can just curl up in my bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-09 13:11:34	I have high hopes for today
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-09 20:41:10	Would like to point out to my neighbours that bonfire night was on Tuesday not tonight so please stop with the fireworks
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-12 10:12:02	Really need to start making plans for days that im off always end up so bored
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-12 13:08:57	@TRON_KAT @adam_stewart95 think its either 5 or 6
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-12 13:10:06	@TRON_KAT wait it closes at 7
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-12 13:32:39	Physio tomorrow hopefully ill finally find out whats wrong
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-12 13:36:56	So the semi final is at tynecastle
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-12 13:44:02	Aberdeen will fill tynecastle themselves
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-12 21:47:27	Realised going to the physio involves my lying half naked in front of a women I dont know
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-12 22:05:35	@euan_watson yeah you obviously do ;)
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-12 22:26:02	Think I may have broken my brother
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-12 15:12:06	I might have just bought some new running stuff....oops
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-13 01:12:08	Got to remain positive!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-13 12:05:11	Some people really need to sort themselves out
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-13 12:16:16	When I wear my hair up I feel like I look about 5
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-13 12:41:24	Im excited for coaching today the children are so lovely!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-13 12:51:04	Homemade soup is just great
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-13 13:37:33	Dont you ever wonder how we survive
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-13 14:59:40	I hate the rain
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-13 17:27:49	Well this isnt good :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-13 17:39:05	At least I finally know whats wrong with my foot and I can now work on fixing it
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-13 18:50:02	Why does badminton have so many rules!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-13 19:33:45	Found out I've got tendonitis in my foot from a tendon strain and a weakness that I have in my foot :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-13 22:19:42	The physio wasn't lying when she said I would be in more pain later on
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-15 17:40:35	Spending my night doing foot exercises....so exciting
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-15 21:53:00	If anyone wakes me up early tomorrow I won't be happy
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-17 11:54:36	That was the first good sleep I've had in ages
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-17 13:44:11	I'm in tomorrow for like 2 hours then I'm off the rest of the week...not bad
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-14 07:38:15	Stood up this morning and basically fell back down had no strength in my leg
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-14 07:41:48	Yeah im not happy this morning at all
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-17 15:16:14	Think ill just lock myself if my room considering everything that happens in this house is my fault!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-14 12:49:31	The east Kilbride trains better be back on for when I finish college
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-18 16:25:45	Finally!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-16 11:24:38	Hate not having football on a Saturday I never know what to do
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-16 11:35:36	The postman better get here before I go out
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-14 17:24:09	Meant to have combat tonight.....don't known if I'm allowed to do it or not
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-17 19:56:32	It feels so much later than it actually is
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-17 20:17:58	I'm sorry but what!?
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-18 16:49:14	Finally got a job!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-16 13:14:31	Came to the conclusion that my postman is dead
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-18 21:13:24	Dont know if I can watch this eating challenge
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-18 22:06:56	I'm off till next Monday!!

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-14 22:55:22	I'm going into college tomorrow to sit on a bench for 2 hours
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-16 20:52:22	Today has been such a lazy day
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-16 22:21:53	Really hope my mum gets the last train home I really don't want to drive into town to get her
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-15 09:13:45	Can feel myself falling asleep on this train
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-15 13:20:25	Didn't realise how difficult it would be to get a white shirt!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-15 13:40:12	I have totally given up with scotrail
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-19 11:06:39	I'm only human I can take so much until I've had enough
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-19 11:07:29	I really should move and start getting ready but my beds so warm and comfy!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-19 12:41:23	This week is going to be good
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-19 23:25:28	Don't know if I'm looking forward to tomorrow or not
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-19 23:27:41	Its weird how much things have changed over the past year
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-22 14:52:35	Hate not knowing what to say
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-20 23:53:58	No indoor season for me this year well thats how its looking just now
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-22 07:41:27	Why am I being dragged into my mums work
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-22 22:16:20	Every friday this happens!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-22 22:16:50	I give up

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-22 09:36:58	Ended up in my dads work instead but hes not here this is just great
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-20 11:54:45	Wish they kept the Olympic Stadium in London as a running track http://t.co/shPtRLgCiT
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-20 11:56:39	Wish I had went to London and got the opportunity to see the Olympic Park
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-20 12:46:26	Came upstairs to tidy my room and make my bed yeah I'm now back in my bed and I don't want to move
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-22 15:35:33	Might just become a surveyor spend a lot of time in my dads work and end up doing loads of work when I'm there
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-22 15:38:11	Then again its boring
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-21 11:17:14	Had my first nightmare in ages last night was horrible
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-21 14:03:08	I need to start Christmas shopping but people are so difficult to buy for!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-23 22:35:12	I really can't deal with how cold this country is!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-20 14:10:26	Struggling to find any motivation to get ready
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-20 16:00:45	The girls were so hyper at coaching today
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-21 15:25:48	I hate foam rollers
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-23 13:21:21	When being strong is your only option you realise exactly just how strong you are
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-20 20:04:42	Women in nandos keeps coming over every 5 minutes to ask how my food is just leave me alone and let me eat my chicken!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-23 22:40:15	@StephanieCxxx I completely forgot about that!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-21 21:31:20	Ive got a day off tomorrow and I'm being dragged into my mums work
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-24 13:55:42	I'm absolutely dreading tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-24 14:54:03	Broke the self scan checkout at Morrisons
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-24 15:03:57	I shouldn't be allowed out on my own
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-24 15:08:41	Wish there was a quick solution to fix injuries
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-24 22:17:31	Need a hug
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-24 20:18:19	Ive been off for the past week don't know how I feel about getting up at half 6 tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-24 20:19:33	I would actually pay someone to come and play with my hair
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-27 11:59:34	One year I want to go to New York for New Year It looks amazing!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-25 10:26:37	Considering its Monday I'm in quite a good mood
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-26 11:21:06	I keep having such weird dreams
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-26 11:36:55	Can hear my mum talking about me on the phone
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-26 12:06:17	Told my mum I would get dressed an hour ago and im still lying in my bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-27 16:23:19	Wonder what ill get to do at training tonight...
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-26 14:59:30	As soon as I get home I need to change into comfy clothes cant deal with not being comfy
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-25 14:14:27	This anatomy class is ruining my good mood
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-26 17:30:51	I've not been to the gym in 2 weeks and I'm struggling to find the motivation to go
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-25 14:54:32	Thank god thats done!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-26 22:46:46	That was a struggle
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-27 22:41:57	I managed to do a slight sprint tonight for the first time in a while and I wasn't in pain
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-27 22:48:09	Felt good running quicker than a jog even if it was only for a few metres shows things are getting better!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-26 23:55:41	Its my brothers birthday next week and I have no idea what to buy him..I need some help!?
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-28 00:11:56	My brother came in with the news hes learning the drums at school and he's quite good at it if a drum kit appears in my house I'm done!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-28 00:22:25	@euan_watson god i know :( don't understand why he can't pick a quiet instrument
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-28 00:29:21	@euan_watson that was a bad decision letting him learn that :L
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-25 16:13:38	Convinced ive done something to my neck after this morning
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-25 17:17:08	Thought my brother was talking to himself turns out he has a friend over
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-28 00:43:21	@euan_watson haha yeah would be worse if he couldn't play!  He'll give you a lesson
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-28 00:48:52	@euan_watson god this will be interesting haha
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-28 08:00:36	Today is going to be a long day I can tell
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-26 00:33:10	My room is freezing!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-28 13:35:30	Its great knowing that some people actually care and are genuine
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-28 14:59:34	I want to go home!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-28 17:09:56	I'm tired and hungry this is not good
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-28 21:30:25	Always feel good after combat!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-28 23:20:43	My legs are agony
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-29 00:25:35	Haven't spoke to you in almost a year and now you just randomly text me pretty sure I deserve some sort of explanation
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-29 08:42:35	As usual my train is delayed
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-29 11:34:36	This is pointless don't know why I'm here!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-29 12:55:38	Scotrail seriously need to get there act together
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-29 12:58:43	Train was delayed this morning then got sent to the wrong platform and train home is delayed again

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-29 15:28:02	Decided I'm just going to buy my brother a top from hollister for his birthday
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-29 20:48:43	Just realised the Aberdeen game is on Sunday not tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-30 02:01:13	Been sitting watching the news for the past 2 hours
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-30 11:23:23	That was possibly the best sleep I've had in ages
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-04 19:19:19	Had like an hour long shower to try and heat myself up after training it didn't work still absolutely freezing

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-11-30 12:34:06	So scott just smashed my dads tablet but hes not getting in trouble for it

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-05 22:37:01	Really just want to book a flight and go away for a while
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-05 23:31:58	You are braver than you believe,  stronger than you seem and smarter than you think
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-04 16:06:05	The moment I walk out the door it starts raining :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-06 08:29:33	These 3 hours are going to be the longest ever!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-06 08:02:47	Not even left my house yet and I cant wait till I get home
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-06 21:25:09	I would pay to be able to do the celebrity cyclone trial
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-06 13:37:11	I dont remember signing up to do law

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-07 22:45:24	I want to go to winter wonderland it looks so good!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-08 00:10:41	What is this circle thing I keep getting invites for
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-10 02:00:23	Just realised how close Christmas is and just how unorganised I am.....
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-07 12:23:26	Can't remember the last time I was in Perth

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-07 14:24:08	Thanks for the warning http://t.co/yUYFE7k47H
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-08 12:11:40	I feel like someone has smacked me over the head with a frying pan
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-07 20:53:50	I think going for a nap was a bad idea
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-10 13:32:56	I should probably get out of my bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-08 22:45:10	McGinns goal though.....
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-10 17:38:44	5 days left in college till I stop for Christmas!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-08 21:20:45	Well this has put me off my food
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-08 23:08:11	I'm not accepting that its Monday tomorrow

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-10 22:37:42	What the hell is this update about

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-12 23:42:00	My head is so sore
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-11 15:35:55	Driving stresses me out at times
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-13 08:36:20	Its the little things people do that make everything better
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-13 08:39:14	So happy its friday!

154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-16 16:26:08	If this person beside me on the train moves any closer they will be sitting on me....personal space has been invaded
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-16 16:51:44	2 girls on the train shouting all the stops.....we all know where the train goes now ssshhh!
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-16 17:50:00	Walk in the door and my mums first words to me are why are you home?  Thanks mum good to know I'm loved
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-16 18:44:24	It gets harder before it gets easier. But it will get better you've just got to make it through the tough part first
154646344	rebecca7654	2013-12-16 19:20:15	Absolutely knackered

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-02 23:11:35	Was looking forward to a long lie tomorrow but that's no longer happening
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-05 00:57:17	I should be running at the Emirates today but no still recovering from this injury!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-03 20:39:32	Really need a leg and back massage I'm so sore!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-06 07:30:39	Think I could actually cry
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-06 07:46:49	I've had enough of today already
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-06 16:12:44	Today wasn't that bad but I can't wait to get home get food and curl up in bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-07 07:51:20	Well this is going to be interesting today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-05 17:55:59	Guarantee I'll have no voice tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-05 21:58:10	@Big_Hec35 can you not just stay
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-05 22:19:46	I need a few more weeks off
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-06 18:27:23	Each day that goes by I get more and more nervous about not getting placed at a camp @CCUSAUK
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-05 23:02:13	Guarantee when I go to the gym tomorrow there's going to be so many new people getting inductions and taking up all the equipment
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-05 23:03:13	Should really just avoid the gym for the first few weeks in January because that's how long people normally last before they give up
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-05 23:06:27	I like the gym when it's quiet that's all
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-04 21:00:24	I've had such a good day!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-06 22:01:54	Ordered new athletics clothes last night....oops
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-08 00:52:52	Looking forward to getting a long lie
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-08 12:17:46	After today I'm not back in work until the 19th
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-08 13:44:57	Currently sound like mutley the dog when I laugh
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-08 14:29:05	Tickets for the celtic game are cheaper than tickets for motherwell
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-08 23:56:16	Are you being serious
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-09 16:23:10	I know its only a joke but certain people are taking it too far
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-10 16:18:24	This delivery guy better hurry up!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-11 17:02:20	There's a slight chance I might have an extra 2 tickets for the semi-final
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-11 22:54:24	This is difficult
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-10 08:33:11	Congratulations @J_Ennis little baby on the way!!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-12 22:38:26	It's only January and I seriously can't wait for summer
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-11 11:42:04	Need something to do today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-11 13:56:16	Each time I stand up I get a really sore head
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-13 01:05:17	Sometimes you've got to fall before you can fly
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-10 19:45:21	Here we go
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-10 20:13:56	That was a penalty!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-10 21:34:29	That goal.....oh my
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-10 21:44:08	@JrAthletics don't like it one bit
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-10 21:47:01	The new team gb kit looks about 10 years old much nicer when it was adidas @JrAthletics
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-12 19:23:02	So sad hearing of the passing of Cammy Smith was such a devoted aberdeen fan and was such a fighter #WeAreAllCammySmith
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-11 18:02:47	I'm so bored!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-13 07:41:07	I've been awake for an hour and can already tell I'm going to hate today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-13 07:59:03	I will end up snapping at someone today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-12 12:42:23	Just tried on my aberdeen kit from when I was a mascot 5 years ago and it still fits looked at the top and its an age 10-12
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-13 14:55:46	The next hour better fly in
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-14 16:49:37	Minutes applause at the game on Saturday on the 26th minute for Cammy Smith http://t.co/F2jI0PGjsS
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-13 22:45:22	Mum and dad spent most of the night convincing me to go back to karate I really need to go back miss it so much
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-14 22:49:38	So happy to be running again!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-15 22:43:32	Happy with how training went today!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-15 22:54:02	I'm so bad at making decisions
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-15 23:28:24	Decided to see what all the fuss is about so I'm watching breaking bad
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-17 14:05:59	I've been putting fires out all my life
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-18 16:55:41	The hearts game sounds eventful
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-18 16:57:50	All the games went in our favour today and we mucked up again
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-16 09:01:47	Stressful morning
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-16 09:15:51	Currently in cambuslang....don't even know
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-18 20:15:07	Smacked my head off a chair last night and I now have a stupid lump
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-19 01:39:06	Found out my niece is going to New York in April im so jealous of her would love to go back!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-17 18:36:01	I have no idea what to wear
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-19 12:47:25	Don't understand how I'm still so tired
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-19 13:43:38	I need to feel better by 5
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-18 11:34:23	Getting up at half 7 this morning was such a challenge
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-16 16:56:17	Get to my dad's work walk in and the first thing I hear is oh look who's here to cause trouble
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-16 17:01:55	Beauty is a light that shines from the darkness
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-16 17:54:35	Vodafone needs to sort themselves out
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-19 23:53:25	Tonight was eventful
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-20 16:48:43	What was the point in that!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-20 16:56:42	Basically going to get in get changed and back out the door again
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-21 18:09:32	Really want to see the wolf of wall street
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-21 20:15:49	Oh great....
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-22 12:05:27	Really wish I lived in a warm country
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-20 22:36:45	Just been told I have the doctors tomorrow morning which means no long lie again
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-23 22:09:35	@TRON_KAT are you walking from the station to court tomorrow?
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-23 22:15:47	@TRON_KAT ahh okay im not sure if I'm meeting people or just walking straight from central
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-23 22:16:39	@TRON_KAT yeah I do
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-23 22:18:56	@TRON_KAT knowing me I'll get lost
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-22 23:19:04	So I need to sit through a coaching course ive already done for the next 3 Thursday mornings...not amused in the slightest
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-23 23:08:40	My mum has a better social life than me
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-24 00:10:40	Not amused at the fact I need to get up at half 6
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-23 08:46:13	Cannot be bothered today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-23 17:33:20	Scored a goal playing football today this is a proud moment for me
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-24 07:44:14	Prerty sure I've forgot something
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-24 12:52:16	Interesting morning
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-24 12:55:01	Home then a wee nap before work
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-24 23:10:04	I am so tired
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-24 23:14:30	Need this cough and cold to shift
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-26 03:16:44	Every time I lie on my back or side I end up in a coughing fit guess I'm not getting any sleep tonight then
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-26 18:26:23	Wish the weekends were longer
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-26 20:25:39	@TRON_KAT do you know what the other two questions are for this thing for elspeth tomorrow?
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-26 20:30:22	@TRON_KAT I know one is the equipment the referee/official needs but not the other
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-26 23:27:26	Got so many exciting things happening in the next couple of months!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-29 00:52:53	@euan_watson I'm enjoying it haha!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-27 21:55:13	Saturday cannot come quick enough!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-27 22:59:06	Pretty happy right now!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-26 12:00:22	Actually managed to get a decent sleep
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-26 13:10:07	Guarantee the computer, printer or internet will stop working today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-26 14:00:31	After today im never writing another training programme again
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-26 14:32:39	Constantly worrying about things
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-27 16:22:12	Need like a week to recover after today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-27 19:03:40	So vodafone have decided I no longer get signal in majority of my house
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-28 16:41:29	Traffic was an absolute nightmare
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-31 08:06:37	My full body is in so much pain
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-31 08:08:02	Just realised I get paid today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-31 14:17:43	I don't understand how my body is in so much pain just straightening my leg is such a challenge
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-30 01:52:19	Was really happy I managed to sprint for the first time in a few months at training tonight but I now have the worst pain in my foot again
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-30 02:36:28	This feels worse than before......great
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-30 08:42:57	Its a constant screaming match in my house
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-01 12:18:43	Hello Edinburgh!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-01 12:34:00	plans have completely changed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-01 14:06:40	Nervous doesnt cover how I'm feeling right now
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-01 16:48:55	Cruising on through
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-01-30 23:32:24	If I lose myself tonight, it'll be by your side.
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-02 14:53:04	The question is what ground will the final be at now?
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-02 14:56:00	@wilkiex dont think it will be
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-02 20:12:07	If I pass this anatomy exam tomorrow it will be some sort of miracle
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-03 17:39:50	How I feel about getting up at half 5 tomorrow http://t.co/j9dNCDo2yr
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-03 18:08:56	Think I've made a very sensible and correct decision
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-04 00:24:38	So I'm up in 5 hours....great
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-06 12:57:58	At least something positive came out of today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-06 17:31:20	Eventful day
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-06 21:34:41	Took the abs track at combat everyone was pretty much dead after it including me
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-09 10:40:05	Wonder what I'll be doing today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-08 00:49:03	Loved @the1975 before tonight and I love them even more now!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-08 14:48:17	Aberdeen going for the double then!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-10 17:06:07	How I managed to pass my anatomy exams is beyond me! Happy I passed!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-11 23:23:22	Tomorrow is going to be horrible have so much to do!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-09 21:15:26	This better be the last training programme I need to write
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-12 11:00:27	Would be much easier for me to write these reports if my laptop would let me open the power points and word documents for the notes I need!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-09 23:02:04	My brother is off Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday....ehhh how do I not get a holiday
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-12 15:00:56	Working till midnight then staying up till whatever time to get these reports done...great
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-13 12:17:03	The past 24 hours have been hell
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-13 16:48:32	I miss school but words cannot describe how happy I am that I don't need to do prelims anymore
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-15 18:56:21	Might just wear jammies tonight
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-15 20:51:19	I should be getting ready but my bed is so comfy and warm
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-16 21:03:47	Hate how I don't have a single day free this week :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-17 22:19:22	Possibly one of the best films ever
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-20 13:36:10	Cant wait till I get home and I can curl up in my bed!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-22 11:44:42	Its just one thing after another these days
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-15 09:45:13	Hoping this shift goes in fast
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-16 10:53:28	Today was the only day I was getting a long lie then I agreed to go into work for 5 hours...
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-16 11:38:44	@euan_watson I seriously do! There was no stopping me last night I just kept talking and talking ;)
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-21 12:09:17	Bought my ticket for the cup final!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-24 22:46:44	Say something, I'm giving up on you I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-24 22:56:38	I really don't understand my family at times
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-24 15:03:32	Was so pointless going in today!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-25 22:18:22	I haven't been to Aberdeen in over a month!  Saturday can't come quick enough
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-28 12:20:27	So excited for sunday!!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-01 18:27:29	So excited for tomorrow!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-28 13:01:26	Got paid more than I expected!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-27 08:26:25	37 days till I leave this country for a week. Can't wait till I'm back in Cyprus
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-02-27 10:19:36	@euan_watson @UberFacts omg yeah that is so me!!! :P
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-03 23:37:02	Every muscle in my body hurts
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-04 14:01:49	I'm in more pain today than I was yesterday
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-04 16:31:13	Hate how I hardly get to see anyone these days
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-05 20:59:38	Its just been one of those days
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-06 23:15:19	The next few weekends are looking good
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-09 12:23:26	Had such a good night!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-08 11:53:45	Would really like this shift to fly in

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-17 14:43:57	Creators of lost have finally explained the ending thank god I now understand how it finished
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-18 14:15:29	18 days till Cyprus!  Cant wait to be away in the sun for a week!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-19 22:31:48	Are you actually being serious right now!?
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-18 20:39:25	So excited for things happening in the next few weeks!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-20 23:26:53	Feel like this week has dragged in!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-22 10:58:27	Hmmm.....think we need to sort this out
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-22 11:20:47	I overthink everything way to much
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-22 12:18:58	This time in 2 weeks ill be at the airport waiting to board my flight to Cyprus!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-22 20:37:43	Hate keeping things from people
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-23 17:16:49	Pulled over by the police for a random tax and insurance check.......
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-23 17:30:52	@33_gemma stroud road but they are just driving about ek and pulling over random cars
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-23 17:34:32	@33_gemma you'll be fine! I was shaking so much but then the police women explained ro me what was happening I was okay!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-24 00:06:08	Left leg keeps going into cramp...worst pain ever
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-22 12:58:41	Struggling to find the energy to get ready
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-22 22:37:02	Its just one of those nights...
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-24 20:19:50	In the end everyone turns out to be the person they said they would never be
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-27 23:46:25	I really don't like sport psychology so if this exam could just not happen tomorrow that would be great
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-29 08:42:48	1 week till Cyprus!!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-29 12:06:15	This time next week I'll be in the airport getting ready to board my flight!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-29 23:31:47	Keep saying it but I'm really looking forward to this week
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-30 00:45:51	This time last year I was on a plane to Boston! Want to go back so much!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-30 01:06:08	Not amused my clock went from 00:59 to 02:00
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-27 12:17:09	Possible the worst behaved class ever
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-28 21:24:38	Dont think words can describe just how excited I am for this week
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-31 00:20:12	Think all the lectures just have a meeting and decide to give us all of our reports and exams for the same time
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-31 09:36:50	Screwed for this anatomy exam
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-03-31 16:34:15	Normally only start panicking about flying the day before but for some reason im freaking out already
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-04 09:21:52	Cyprus tomorrow!!!!!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-04 14:16:32	Off for 3 weeks! That will do nicely!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-01 22:48:28	Day out in Edinburgh tomorrow!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-02 22:11:23	Had such a great day in Edinburgh!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-05 01:59:03	Up in 5 hours and I'm not even tired!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-05 07:20:40	@euan_watson haha was only fair! Thank you anyway!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-05 10:56:38	@euan_watson @AndrewMcGregor2 I did not steal the minion it was given to me :P I wouldn't dare steal it
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-05 10:58:00	@euan_watson @AndrewMcGregor2 who is Alexander
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-05 11:01:54	@AndrewMcGregor2 @euan_watson im confused now
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-05 11:02:57	@euan_watson @AndrewMcGregor2 oh wait I get it #bitslow
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-05 19:20:35	Hello Cyprus!!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-05 19:32:01	Absolutely knackered and its only half 10 here
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-07 11:47:41	Think moving to Cyprus would be a good idea
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-06 08:53:57	Told last night it was to be really cloudy today but I'm currently lying by the pool and theres not a single cloud in the sky
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-07 16:41:56	Came all the way to Cyprus and I've bought new running trainers....only me
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-07 20:59:59	Made friends with a swedish couple and im apparently going to stay with them in Sweden for a few weeks...
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-07 23:21:29	Next week is going to be good!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-10 09:03:48	2nd last day :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-13 11:13:31	Someone care to explain why there is 5 referees currently running on the pitch
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-13 14:59:54	Waking up this morning to rain and wind after a week of sun was horrible
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-13 00:02:33	HOME! Well at edinburgh airport!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-13 00:32:44	The last 10 minutes of my flight were horrible was convinced the plane was going to flip because of the wind
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-13 01:25:05	Nothing better than coming home and lying in your own bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-14 11:10:22	The next few days are going to drag in
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-14 17:10:04	I'm never changing who I am
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-14 17:31:09	Get to go back to training next Wednesday words actually cannot describe how excited and happy I am about this
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-14 19:59:11	This is my life and my story I decide how its written
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-10 18:41:50	The swedish couple are back!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-10 19:07:42	Would happily just stay here and not go home!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-14 21:22:20	Tomorrow is one year since the boston marathon bombing #BostonStrong
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-14 21:26:18	Back to work tomorrow after 10 days off.....
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-10 20:06:26	Someone scratched the front of my car and just got a message from my neighbour saying hes fixed it!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-14 03:11:19	Love surprising people!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-10 21:39:32	Last full day tomorrow :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-15 10:23:34	If today and tomorrows shift could just fly in that would be great
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-15 11:43:21	So excited for combat on Thursday actually sad how much I've missed it
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-11 19:44:09	This time tomorrow ill be on my way home! Its been a quick week
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-12 10:46:21	4 hour wait till we go to the airport
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-16 09:11:05	Struggling to get out of bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-16 09:15:49	Would really appreciate if the new shift system at work would start working so I actually know when I'm suppose to be working
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-12 14:36:49	Flight doesnt leave for another 4 hours.....
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-12 16:12:01	The thought of going back to work after over a week off actually hurts
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-12 16:37:22	Oh well ill be back in Cyprus in 77 days :)
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-17 16:35:27	Back to body combat tonight!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-17 13:50:07	Just go away and stay out of my business
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-17 22:05:26	Think ill be sleeping downstairs tonight my legs are agony!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-18 13:43:23	Currently standing staring at my fridge hoping that food will appear
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-19 07:43:02	People who genuinely care are the best seriously don't know what I'd do with you
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-19 07:43:25	4 hours sleep now an 8 hour shift lets see how this goes...
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-20 18:51:05	Oh the drama
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-19 19:02:18	The past can hurt but the way I see it you can either run from it or learn from it its your choice
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-22 22:32:03	Its strange how in a year so much has changed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-22 09:39:35	I want to take a year out and go travelling.....
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-21 12:36:50	Can't actually remember the last time I was at training nervous and happy to be going back
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-22 18:39:46	Well this is just great...
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-24 22:30:28	I'm in desperate need of a sport massage
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-25 07:08:15	My muscles are so sore
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-25 08:20:24	Pretty sure this time last year we had all been chucked out
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-23 22:14:13	I seriously dont think I can deal with children tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-26 21:13:41	Think with your heart not with your head
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-25 10:09:56	Great my shoe has burst
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-26 21:45:59	Curled up in bed and its only quarter to 11
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-24 06:51:11	I hate today already
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-23 17:21:11	Decked it on the portakabin stairs and cut my arm..only me
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-27 13:11:03	Would like this report to just disappear
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-28 16:20:46	@euan_watson I had the voice and everything right on point #EuanLovesHisBath
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-29 12:43:19	Always working when its a nice day
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-28 06:25:30	Don't think anyone understands exactly just how much I hate Mondays
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-01 11:56:12	Placement finished!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-30 18:38:07	Not eating before training was not a wise decision
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-29 22:48:16	Was suppose to finish work at quarter to 9 and was kept on till 11 oh well extra money
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-01 17:33:59	The world does not revolve around you....just get a grip
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-30 20:06:38	Last day of placement tomorrow!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-01 22:44:21	Its just one thing after another these days
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-04-30 21:48:56	Its just not that simple
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-02 08:01:36	Feel as if the muscle in my left leg can't stretch absolute agony when I walk
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-04 17:43:34	Might have made a cheeky wee purchase
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-03 15:18:21	Think I was more impressed with Logans back flips than his goal
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-02 22:05:40	You can only be strong enough for so much but then there comes a point where you just have to break
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-03 15:20:58	Logan has had a great game today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-04 15:55:14	I should not be allowed to go shopping
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-05 19:05:38	Up at half 6 tomorrow for a 4 and a half hour shift.....not amused in the slightest
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-06 05:57:57	Don't really know anymore
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-06 19:43:25	@Jiee93 ehhhh no aberdeen please!

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-06 19:47:52	@Jiee93 hmm well I don't see that happening
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-06 13:30:55	My wage is absolutely shocking
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-06 15:45:29	Need a hug
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-09 14:10:53	Basically spent my wage on my mum for her birthday.....
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-06 19:33:46	What a game langfield is having
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-08 15:54:05	New season ticket has been purchased!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-08 16:04:17	@_CJStevenson ive been siting starting at my laptop for like 2 hours no clue what to write

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-08 16:12:51	@_CJStevenson same no clue
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-08 22:52:49	Never be ashamed of a scar it simply means you were stronger than whatever tried to hurt you
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-13 18:02:54	Only in Scotland can I spend the full day outside and end up with a burnt face :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-12 21:52:44	@euan_watson pittodrie is exactly where you were meant to be you and the tattoo both know this ;)
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-12 22:15:15	@euan_watson oh were you now? Think you should just admit you're a fan and stop denying it
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-11 21:56:05	Why do I need to know the 3 sections of the small intestine like what benefit does this have to my life
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-12 06:54:55	I'm running on empty
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-14 13:35:39	Log books and lesson plans are the biggest pain in my life right now
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-14 15:07:03	Mum and dad are away all next weekend and ive been given all closes by my work well there goes my plans
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-15 14:31:21	Have a feeling this summer is going to be a good one!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-14 18:12:11	Every time I check my schedule for work its different
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-16 12:52:10	All of the stars will guide us home
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-16 10:24:26	My work is going to be roasting today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-16 10:26:24	I got up at half 7 to go in for 45 minutes not amused at all
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-15 09:27:14	In so much pain its unreal
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-15 11:02:07	Im going to be an emotional wreck when the fault in our stars comes out
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-15 13:49:41	44 days till Cyprus! Hurry up please!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-16 07:44:21	Only thing getting me through today is the fact its my last friday in college
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-18 08:57:25	Don't know how people wake up early out of choice when I'm not working I stay in bed for as long as possible
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-19 18:34:07	Only monday and I need it to be the weekend
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-19 22:27:08	I wish things were easier
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-19 22:42:40	The moment my brothers not well everyone in the house feels sorry for him and he gets to stay off completely different if I'm unwell
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-05-19 22:46:37	Pretty clear who the favourite is in the family

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-09 19:41:20	My head is pounding
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-09 20:40:12	Such a creep
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-09 21:27:40	Spending my night coming up with new ab routines for classes I might get to teach at
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-08 20:45:27	I want to go a run or something.....I'm rather bored
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-10 00:26:15	I really miss Portugal its basically my 2nd home and I think of everyone over there as my 2nd family :( should just book a flight and go..
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-08 22:17:46	So happy I've finished college and that I don't need to get up at half 6 tomorrow!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-13 13:18:56	A for graded unit, college officially finished and passed! Summer can now commence!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-13 13:26:10	The fact im now not working till half 4 tomorrow is making going out tonight rather tempting....
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-13 13:27:33	Then again I need to save money
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-13 13:31:31	Looks like I'm getting my new phone on Monday. ... if vodafone sort themselves out
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-12 21:08:52	That was possibly the most emotional thing ever
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-13 14:35:43	Basically spend my days off in bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-10 23:45:06	Its the little things
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-10 23:49:14	Love surprising people
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-13 00:10:56	You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world but you do have some say in who hurts you.
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-13 23:14:07	Actually so happy I'm not starting work at 6:15 in the morning now! Can get a long lie!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-14 00:35:50	I still haven't recovered from seeing the fault in our stars feel like my heart was ripped from my chest
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-14 14:14:23	I finish work at midnight then im back in at 8 tomorrow morning.....

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-18 13:45:15	This weather is just fabulous and the fact I'm not working today makes it better!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-18 13:53:37	Seriously think I will collapse at training today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-18 14:28:57	Crop top and shorts for training I think
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-17 09:11:37	Got my payslip and it was definitely worth doing all those shifts last week!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-15 15:50:10	5 hours down 4 and a half to go
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-17 12:20:23	So happy someone took my shift for tomorrow I can actually now go to training!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-17 14:14:48	Need to get ready for work but I just can't bring myself to do it
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-18 22:50:51	Loved training today! Happy to be back and injury free and jumping what would be personal bests if it was a competition!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-19 00:22:00	Downside to a long jump session I now have sand in my bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-19 00:32:55	This is going to be harder than I thought..... :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-19 11:49:51	So excited to go scuba diving in Cyprus again!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-19 12:24:13	New season ticket has arrived!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-20 17:44:17	Want to curl up in a ball 😞
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-19 08:50:50	Need to leave for the hairdressers in 10 minutes and I'm still in bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-19 11:26:17	Need something to do.....

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-19 23:31:15	Having one of those nights 😕
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-21 21:13:39	2nd time seeing the fault in our stars and I think I cried more than the first time
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-21 00:20:31	Such an emotional person at times 😢
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-21 10:14:46	Rather jealous of @euan_watson who's away off on holiday today while in stuck in work 😛
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-22 00:07:25	Can't deal with this
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-20 12:01:42	The year after I leave school and the Scottish schools are being held at Hampden! Extremely jealous but good luck to everyone!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-22 19:43:37	Everything's always my fault
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-24 10:50:27	My throat is killing me
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-22 22:09:23	Looking at the forecast for the weather in Cyprus and it's to be 35 on Saturday! That will do nicely! ☀️
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-23 18:03:09	Wish I could just go to sleep and wake up on Saturday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-23 23:41:36	I'm excited about going on holiday but I'm not really up for this 5 hour flight
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-26 13:37:33	And I'm now working tonight....
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-24 17:24:59	After tonight I have 1 more shift then that's me off for 17 days and away to Cyprus on Saturday! ☀️☀️
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-24 12:12:49	Curled up in bed not feeling well and I have work in a few hours :(
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-26 23:20:52	1 day till Cyprus!!! ☀️☀️
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-25 10:28:21	Last shift today!!!! 🎉☀️
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-25 13:47:28	3 days till Cyprus! The countdown is on!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-29 13:56:50	Today started off well until I fainted...just remember waking up with ice towels on me...so scary
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-28 20:55:29	It's midnight and it's 28 degrees! I love Cyprus!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-27 21:40:11	For some reason I'm not excited about going on holiday tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-28 00:34:30	I wish I could forget the stupid little things
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-28 09:52:48	And the arguments have started and we haven't even left for the airport yet
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-28 13:26:16	Flying stresses me out so much 😟
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-28 13:26:58	There's a bouncy castle in the airport and my inner child really wants to go on it
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-30 10:12:42	Day 2 and it's 37 degree today! Loving this! http://t.co/LkAGvpQqGy
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-06-30 10:47:45	Keep getting free water because of yesterday
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-04 19:22:16	Don't think today could get any better!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-04 19:34:28	Convinced I've become immune to the vodka here it's having no effect on me at all
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-04 13:53:02	6 days in and I'm quite happy with my tan so far! http://t.co/H5x3WPUrNc
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-03 13:30:58	I'm such a kid so excited for the water park on Monday
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-06 11:19:25	Challenging my brother to go on every slide at the water park tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-03 19:20:02	Yessssss Aberdeen!!!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-08 18:54:45	I get home at 4 in the morning on Sunday and I have a shift at work starting at 11 😩
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-07 14:29:07	Don't think I have laughed as much in ages the water park was absolutely hilarious
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-09 20:26:22	So many new people at my work just looked at my shifts for next week after 2 weeks off and don't know half the people
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-10 10:21:30	The fact McDonald's do delivery over here is so tempting not had one in ages and I'm really hungry
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-10 10:27:54	2 days left 😢
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-13 02:18:32	Oh Scotland how I've not missed you
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-12 09:32:02	Don't want to come home 😟
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-13 08:53:18	This shift is probably going to kill me
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-12 18:43:18	Absolutely knackered better sleep on the plane or there's no chance I'll be able to function at work tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-12 19:33:29	Bye Cyprus 😟 time to come home ✈️
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-14 01:54:23	It's the little things 😊
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-14 01:49:29	Should be tired but no I'm wide awake
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-15 16:28:26	I've agreed to go and work in a different store next week not sure why
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-15 17:18:02	Seems like a nice wee night for a run
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-15 19:56:09	It's amazing how quickly things can change
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-14 13:02:28	The pain my chest is in from this cough is unreal 😪
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-16 08:38:15	I've been awake for 4 and a half hours still not over 4 hours to go
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-14 18:13:19	So so tired and I'm up early the next couple of days
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-14 22:04:39	A smile can hide so much
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-17 20:51:32	Still can't get over what me and @EmmaSpringett witnessed today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-20 11:23:40	I've been home a week and I seriously cannot wait till I can go away again
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-19 00:08:56	No chance am I sleeping tonight....stupid cough
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-22 00:19:33	Happy happy 😊
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-23 19:12:34	The commonwealth games are finally here!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-22 16:04:49	Why can the weather not be like this all the time
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-23 23:56:56	Don't know how I feel about this working in a different store for a week situation...
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-23 23:58:45	Would also appreciate if next week could hurry up!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-24 10:18:00	The thought of doing a 4-12 tonight actually makes me want to cry
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-24 12:57:25	Hope the weather stays like this for Saturday night!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-23 22:32:08	Well that was awkward
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-26 09:50:59	Work is not where I want to be I'm going to go and curl up in a ball
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-27 18:25:11	Finally emerged from my room
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-27 15:35:49	Convinced people last night that i was the girl in the trivago advert
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-27 23:47:08	Discovered I've bruised and really hurt my shoulder after decking it in the bathroom multiple times last night
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-27 12:59:44	Cannot even begin to describe the state I was in last night...I don't even know how I got home
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-28 15:46:07	Sometimes I want to just curl up in a ball and disappear
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-29 12:10:32	Walked out my house to go to work and there's some random guy on the roof of my house!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-30 11:46:42	So excited to go and see the athletics at Hampden tonight!!

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-30 21:20:52	What a night! That was amazing! Best money was definitely watching Greg Rutherford win Gold!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-29 01:04:37	Absolutely horrible....bed is needed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-07-31 23:56:08	I'm up in like 4 hours for work and I'm wide awake...no sleep for me then
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-03 00:45:35	Such a good day! Exactly what I needed!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-03 00:48:16	Also love making plans and having things to look forward to!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-03 11:18:14	@ainsley1994 @mlfc2013  good luck!! 😄
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-03 11:22:03	Woke up to an empty house and I have no clue where everyone is
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-03 11:39:10	Wish I was at the netball final today!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-03 12:07:33	I always get so worried over the silliest little things
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-02 04:19:46	I do not approve of this 4:45 start on a Saturday 😴😴
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-01 20:22:55	@LynseySharp interview just shows how much she has been through and what it means to her! So emotional and inspiring!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-04 06:51:04	I'd really like a long lie but all I get is early shifts so that's never happening
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-03 15:57:34	Kinda regretting not going to America this summer...
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-03 16:10:03	I don't wanna be the girl who has to fill the silence, the quiet scares me because it screams the truth
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-04 23:21:21	So happy I don't need to worry about exam results this year
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-05 21:09:36	After tomorrow I'm off for 2 days it's rather sad how happy I am about this
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-05 21:55:08	When I'm working Niki is off when she's working I'm off! @NikiGilmour get your shifts sorted!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-05 21:57:45	@NikiGilmour get your store sorted! Haha in all seriousness it has been ages!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-05 22:02:26	@NikiGilmour it really is
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-03 20:57:51	I'm going to Australia in 2018!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-06 16:00:50	Don't really think today could get worse
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-06 21:35:20	Off work for 2 days, can't wait for a long lie tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-06 22:33:03	Went over my ankle in work and I'm nearly in tears from the pain right now
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-06 23:07:47	At the end of the day life is short do what makes you smile
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-06 23:59:24	Just takes one message to change my mood 😄
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-05 10:01:05	Kill me now 😲🔫
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-05 17:43:47	I need to start thinking before I jump from now on
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-07 11:56:23	Passed my driving test a year ago today!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-07 15:12:09	Do I go out tonight or not that is the question.....
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-06 10:07:47	This shift is going to be horrible I can tell
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-07 23:21:15	I really don't like change....but it's just a part of life that I need to accept
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-10 09:47:10	It's been a while!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-10 15:52:05	Possibly one of the worst games of football I have ever witnessed and that's saying something
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-10 19:30:24	Happy to be home!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-10 19:39:05	Absolutely knackered need my bed 😴
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-08 12:06:15	Never felt so bored in all my life
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-12 11:29:47	I have over 5 hours left when I come back from my break! Feel like I'm doing 2 shifts!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-12 11:38:52	8:30-18:15 what sort of shift is this! Just no! ✋
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-12 15:46:26	Have to stay on now a 10 and a half hour shift
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-12 15:53:14	@aimeeewylie I know! I'm a 8:30-19:00 it's horrible!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-12 15:54:57	@chrisgrhm @aimeeewylie they won't let me leave during gap time! On a 2nd break just now!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-12 15:57:51	@aimeeewylie @chrisgrhm I know I really should! I'll be running out the store  when it hits 7!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-12 16:01:28	@chrisgrhm @aimeeewylie no no I will refuse that's not happening
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-09 18:58:38	I feel so sick I just want to curl up in a ball and sleep
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-09 19:30:27	Fordoun-Portlethen-Cove-Aberdeen my day tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-12 18:30:14	Finally I am home!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-08 23:35:05	I have work in like 11 hours and I just can't accept that
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-09 20:12:55	This is an absolute joke
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-09 00:18:28	See if I'm honest I think I trust about 2 people
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-09 23:10:57	Get to see my Aunt, uncle, my brother and sister and my niece and nephew tomorrow! It's been ages since I've seen them!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-12 23:14:12	The lack of sleep over the past week has caught up with me feeling so drained and ill
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-11 18:18:31	Anytime I'm going out it's like a thousand questions from my mum about where I'm going and who I'm going with
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-13 07:56:38	Got my payslip through and I can't wait until I'm paid on Friday 👌
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-11 22:25:45	Would recommend the inbetweeners 2 it's rather funny and a good wee film
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-11 22:28:29	Seriously can't wait for this shift to be over with tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-14 23:41:54	Rather happy right now 😄
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-14 23:56:15	I plan on having a very lazy day tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-15 19:59:06	Mum had just told me we might be going to Boston in October! This needs to be true! 😬🇺🇸🇺🇸
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-15 20:09:25	Was in Boston just over a year ago and absolutely loved it! If we go in October it will be amazing!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-15 20:19:12	What a run from @Adam_Gemili
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-16 11:56:30	There are no secrets without lies
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-17 19:36:54	I actually feel so ill 😷
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-17 21:21:51	Off work till Saturday! That will do! 👌
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-18 12:13:07	I'm now working tonight 😔
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-17 09:43:01	Just in the door need to get changed and go to work oh this is going to be a fun shift
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-18 14:33:01	This is how I feel about working http://t.co/NZsrGQEC70
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-17 14:51:37	Absolutely knackered!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-20 15:51:10	@StephanieCxxx was absolutely hilarious!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-19 22:56:22	Nice little night! 😄
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-21 05:38:47	Going to get absolutely soaked walking through town
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-21 09:36:17	I have the WORST timetable ever!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-21 22:54:12	My mums doing the ice bucket challenge at work tomorrow I can't wait to see it it's going to be hilarious!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-22 06:44:35	Would do anything to be on holiday again
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-22 06:54:09	Train has a burning smell....
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-22 11:55:35	No idea what to wear tonight 😩
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-22 14:08:25	Looking forward to seeing @StephanieCxxx tonight! It's been too long!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-20 20:10:54	It's happened I've been nominated for the ice bucket challenge! Doing it tomorrow the question is who do I nominate!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-20 20:11:51	@StephanieCxxx we need to meet up for drinks soon! It's been ages!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-20 20:53:37	Been off college since the end of May and I'm up at 6:30 tomorrow to go and get a timetable! 😩
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-21 22:06:29	Done the ice bucket challenge today! http://t.co/7wLDTM3tN5
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-21 23:14:13	I refuse to accept that I'm up at half 6 for college 😩
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-20 23:48:35	@StephanieCxxx Happy Birthday!!!! ❤️ see you Friday! 😄 xxxx
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-23 18:46:16	I don't know how I survived that shift
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-23 19:34:30	2nd time doing the ice bucket challenge and it was so much worse
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-24 19:55:03	Watching the athletics makes me realise how much I have missed competing this season!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-24 19:55:30	Need to get back into a routine with college/work/training
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-24 20:58:26	I have no voice 😶
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-23 09:02:26	Don't think I've ever drank as much in my life actually dying 😩
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-25 08:40:19	Not starting till 12 on a Monday is possibly the best part of my timetable this year
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-25 09:57:50	Wish people would just tell the truth
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-25 21:57:25	I should know you better by now..
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-25 22:46:17	I don't believe anything people tell me these days....get told so many lies
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-25 13:45:17	Realised I now won't be working Monday nights so I could go back to karate.....so so tempting
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-24 06:30:08	I've woke up with a cold and I also have no voice...... 😔
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-25 23:31:54	Back to where I started
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-26 05:57:41	Had enough of early mornings already
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-26 10:57:18	Circuits first thing on a Tuesday morning...I'm dead 😵
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-28 16:06:53	Haircut tomorrow! Thank god!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-26 16:23:18	Home from college...now to get changed and head back into town
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-27 18:13:29	Just booked Cyprus for October!! ☀️🎉☀️😄😄
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-27 06:37:57	@paddyc91 me! I go out on a Tuesday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-26 17:46:06	Train has randomly stopped....great
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-27 22:31:44	In so much pain from circuits yesterday
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-27 22:36:44	Teaching the combat class tomorrow and taking abs at the end! Don't know if I'm nervous or not 😐
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-27 22:37:11	Guarantee I forget everything and I'm standing in front of everyone like an idiot
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-27 22:40:15	@paddyc91 it's set routines...but I'll just make it up if that happens haha
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-28 20:31:31	Team teaching combat and then doing abs myself was so good, loved every minute of it and can't wait to do it all again next week 😄
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-28 22:40:45	Refuse to accept the fact I no longer get a long lie....
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-26 21:41:47	This train is freezing!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-26 22:32:58	Home after being out and it's the question game from my mum..where were you? Who were you with? Who's that? and so on...
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-29 07:14:26	People on the train having a debate about wifi...please be quiet
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-29 13:29:34	Hairdresser cancelled 😒
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-28 21:43:46	So much pain
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-29 06:22:36	Up at 6:30 today and up at 4:45 tomorrow...I just want my bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-29 07:11:14	Please get over yourself
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-29 07:16:54	But I wonder where were you?
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back.           So I wonder where were you?
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-29 17:23:17	Payday is very dangerous!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-29 19:46:39	I've actually had enough of this...everything is always my fault
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-29 20:54:26	Absolute joke!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-30 20:37:01	Half 9 on a Saturday and I'm curled up in bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-30 03:58:23	Up at this time on a Saturday for work is not on! 😔🔫
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-31 10:21:14	7 weeks till ☀️☀️
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-30 08:30:03	3pm needs to hurry up!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-30 15:09:51	Been in the house 5 minutes and I'd much rather still be in work
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-01 14:58:21	On a train with loads of extremely loud school children 😔🔫
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-30 15:40:36	Kitchens just been tidied so I'm not allowed to make anything...last time I had food was at 9 I'm so hungry!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-30 16:37:29	Up at 4:45 this morning home from a 9 hour shift and I'm absolutely knackered 😴
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-31 21:57:41	Worst shift of my life
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-31 22:28:18	@paddyc91 I'm not even kidding everything actually went downhill from the moment you left. Was just a riot
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-31 22:34:15	@paddyc91 there was basically no food at one point and had holds waiting absolute ages and it was just stressful
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-08-31 22:37:54	@paddyc91 yeah 😔 please don't do it again I can't cope when I end up stressed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-01 08:53:20	Have no motivation to get out of bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-02 19:28:58	Finished college at 4 and I'm just on my way home....
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-02 21:54:55	I plan on not returning from Cyprus in October
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-03 07:00:16	That's my mum and dad married 20 years today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-03 07:39:01	3 hour nutrition class 😳🔫
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-02 22:33:52	Never use to wear my hair up but I've realised I can sleep longer if I just tie it up and sleep is very important to me
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-02 22:37:56	Plyometrics and circuits on a Tuesday morning will be the death of me walking up the stairs was a mission
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-04 16:38:50	Worst day 😰
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-03 21:53:48	My muscles hate me...so much pain
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-03 21:56:05	Was using my foam roller and I was crying from the pain....
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-03 21:58:06	Going to just curl up in a ball in bed and hope I can move in the morning
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-05 06:59:20	Dreading going into work after yesterday 😔
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-05 11:44:38	Have no idea what I'm doing anymore
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-05 13:02:48	Only good thing is in 37 days I'm out of this country
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-04 22:48:38	In such a better mood now, it's the little things 😊

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-06 21:46:54	@paddyc91 the holiday is booked but haven't got the days approved please don't do this
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-06 21:57:01	@paddyc91 the holiday is paid for though it's 7 days surely you can survive

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-06 22:09:48	@paddyc91 we can make it through this!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-06 23:31:53	My nose is agony
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-11 20:57:02	Night shift next Friday and Saturday could actually cry 😩
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-11 21:52:06	I hate packing
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-12 07:03:33	Okay it looks like I'm moving out, definitely overpacked
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-14 22:40:43	Lesson plans make me want to cry 😢
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-15 14:56:55	Was looking forward to going home and lying on my bed but I'm now working
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-16 08:45:08	Tuesday means only one thing morning circuits 😩
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-18 07:20:34	Had such a nice wee night 😊😊
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-18 09:02:43	The courtesy car I've been given is gorgeous
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-18 16:05:02	Combat tonight!!😄
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-17 15:30:51	Tomorrow is my only day off and I'm up early to take my car to get serviced 😩
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-18 22:26:07	So many people are leaving my work
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-19 19:03:51	Absolutely shocked at how people are treating each other!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-20 01:40:36	Can't wait to finish and go home to my bed!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-19 07:07:16	People confuse me
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-21 01:00:18	4 hours left...
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-21 13:48:31	Devastated 😨
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-21 21:28:09	Why do bad things happen to the best people....the world is such a cruel place
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-22 20:11:58	It just takes one person to change your day 😊
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-24 22:07:40	Alarm set for 4:45 😩🔫
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-24 23:04:51	Nice little night!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-24 23:05:03	I have work in 6 hours 😔
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-22 23:16:08	The thought of circuits in the morning makes me want to cry
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-23 13:52:04	My wage is shocking 😦
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-25 22:24:07	combat tonight has actually killed me my legs are dead
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-24 12:15:25	Off college till Tuesday! That'll do
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-27 00:08:04	Basically live in work these days
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-24 17:38:44	This train is bloody freezing
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-24 17:42:50	Mate you're not as amazing as you think 👊

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-29 20:23:01	Session plans stress me out so much!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-30 15:56:51	Circuits actually kill me
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-30 00:34:36	Up in 5 hours...should probably sleep 😴
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-30 06:10:29	The thought of circuits this morning makes me want to be sick 😩🔫
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-01 00:38:53	The exorcist is not a scary film in the slightest
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-09-28 18:45:04	The fact that this time in 2 weeks I will not be in this country but in Cyprus is the best thing ever!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-01 12:33:09	Drove to college today so I could get an extra 30 minutes in bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-02 06:11:36	My work is either freezing or roasting there's no in between
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-01 15:28:00	11 days!! ☀️🎉
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-02 09:52:18	Work is freezing today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-01 21:08:15	I'm sorry but the interrogation I go under from my mum whenever I go out is not on
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-01 23:17:55	Looking forward to next week already! ☺️
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-03 22:30:43	All I'm asking for is the occasional Saturday off
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-04 19:24:02	Words cannot describe how happy I am at the fact I have a long lie tomorrow
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-04 12:41:02	This atmosphere is not good
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-03 07:36:23	What's the point in a 30 minute class
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-03 07:40:14	9 days! Hurry up!! ☀️🎉💃
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-04 23:08:11	1 week! All I'm saying!! 💃🎉☀️
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-06 21:51:25	The only thing getting me through this week is knowing I'll be out of this country on Sunday
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-06 20:33:49	Just found out my brother is in Texas....thanks for telling me
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-06 01:17:19	Need this week to go quickly
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-06 09:42:35	Mondays are so pointless!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-07 17:23:29	I had to do dancing today in college anyone who knows me will understand why that did not end well
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-08 01:03:06	In so much shock
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-08 12:52:17	Cannot wait until I'm lying by the pool on Monday
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-08 19:16:36	Thinking of you ❤️ stay strong
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-08 21:01:38	Up at 4:45 for work 😩🔫
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-08 21:38:32	Can't wait till I see annabelle!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-10 06:34:13	Suppose to get the train at 7:42 but I'm just up...guess I'm driving today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-11 02:42:08	So part of the ceiling collapsed in work
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-09 21:19:39	It annoys me that I can no longer donate blood
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-09 21:25:01	@Jiee93 the 2 times I've done it I fainted and I could have a seizure if I do it again
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-09 21:26:10	@Jiee93 it's for the best but it just annoys me
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-09 21:28:42	@Jiee93 yup that's true
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-09 21:30:36	@Jiee93 you should! Help the people who need it
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-09 21:37:10	@Jiee93 got along to your local station and do it! It's 30 minutes of your day!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-12 01:42:13	Was a 7-3 and got sent home at 1:45 not bad
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-12 01:47:21	Do I go to sleep for a couple of hours or just stay awake and sleep on the plane
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-12 06:35:24	Absolutely knackered but the moment I sit on the plane I know I'll be wide awake
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-12 13:24:17	Oh hey Cyprus I've missed you
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-12 13:34:24	@aimeeewylie thank you!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-12 15:10:40	Feel like I'm back home
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-13 11:07:42	Currently lying by the pool in 28 degree heat and I'm pretty happy with life right now
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-13 12:55:36	Why can Scotland not be like this http://t.co/0JjKOpTVXP
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-14 14:06:30	Did not plan on doing a 5 mile walk today happy I did though found such a nice beach
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-14 22:14:17	Such a nice night
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-13 19:43:57	I think the barman is out to kill me this holiday
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-13 19:46:16	I'm actually so happy with everything and everyone in my life right now! Don't think I've ever been as happy
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-13 21:51:34	set my alarm for 9 so I can go and get pancakes for breakfast from the hotel they better be worth it
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-13 22:21:00	@paddyc91 yeah wee vodka with breakfast sorted 👌
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-15 09:13:30	Just after 12 and my brother is still in bed but I guarantee he gets a better tan than me...it always happens
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-15 22:12:30	Having such a fab time in Cyprus but I can't wait for next week 😊
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-17 12:01:47	The pool boy here is something else
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-17 12:21:04	I refuse to accept the fact I come home in 2 days
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-18 09:27:48	Last day 😩
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-18 12:23:30	Spent the past week in bikinis and wearing shorts and dresses I'm not prepared for coming home and having to wear like 10 layers of clothing
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-17 19:11:22	Convinced I've broken my ankle
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-18 20:07:03	Don't know how I feel about being on a plane tomorrow with a hangover
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-16 09:21:43	Everything was so different this time last year I'm so much happier and less stressed now
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-19 07:09:07	The only good thing about coming home is I'll be in my own bed tonight
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-19 10:50:24	I better sleep on this plane
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-20 22:16:41	Tomorrow is going to be a tough day
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-19 12:41:19	Hate all this waiting about
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-21 21:08:27	Stressing out just attempting to fill out the education details page on ucas 😩
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-22 07:38:15	Reverse parking is not my strong point
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-20 17:57:52	Can't wait for Wednesday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-22 15:13:02	This weather is so depressing
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-23 16:35:47	Got a report due tomorrow haven't even started it and I'm currently curled up in bed watching friends. Clearly I've got my priorities right
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-21 17:16:30	Today I said goodbye to my Aunt. Such a bright and wonderful women who I'll never forget ❤️
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-23 09:05:00	Niki is picking me up in 10 minutes and I'm still in bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-23 23:05:11	I've got a report to hand in that's due in 10 hours and so far I have my name and an introduction...it's going to be a long night
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-24 10:32:37	@euan_watson I'm not racist at all
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-24 10:44:44	It's getting to the point I've got so much stuff to do but there's not enough hours in the day
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-24 10:58:23	Convinced this train is going to breakdown either that or the guy doesn't know how to drive it
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-24 20:26:05	First year in ages I've not been excited for my birthday
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-26 18:56:11	So excited to see annabelle tonight!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-25 19:40:34	Got home from work at 4 fell asleep on the couch just woke up now in my bed because I feel like death
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-25 21:31:30	Probably one of the last people to see it but I can't wait until I see annabelle tomorrow night
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-28 09:41:35	Came into college for starting at 9 found out class is cancelled till 1 great
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-27 19:22:32	Struggling to find motivation for college this year
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-29 23:21:56	See if I go to the Apple Store on Friday and they says there's nothing wrong with my phone I'll flip
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-30 05:51:42	Every Thursday I have work at 6 all I'm asking for is a long lie please!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-30 18:40:30	The fact I need to dress up for combat tonight makes me want to cry
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-30 22:33:51	Trying to teach combat while my mum was taking part in the class dressed as a horse has to be one of the most hilarious moments ever
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-30 08:45:33	If you only knew 🙈
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-10-31 23:22:27	Such a great birthday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-02 06:15:28	This shift will actually kill me
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-03 21:50:04	My laptop is going out of the window in a second! 😡
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-05 00:50:47	Cute movie nights are the best ☺️
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-03 10:53:03	In love with my new hoodie!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-04 07:42:23	I refuse to take part in circuits this morning
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-04 08:35:29	Trust it to be the day I'm taking a session and I feel like death
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-04 17:30:49	I don't really see the point in bonfire night
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-05 16:44:23	Seem to be a taxi service for my brother and I don't approve of this
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-05 18:58:32	I like the look of fireworks just not the sound
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-06 07:21:49	Lack of sleep is definitely getting to me feel so ill
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-07 14:25:24	Thank god that's sports research out of the way. It's been the biggest pain in my life for the last 11 weeks
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-07 14:46:28	Today I'm a close in work next Friday I'm nightshift 😒
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-08 12:34:57	The fact I'm off work till Thursday makes me rather happy!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-08 12:37:29	Can't wait for tomorrow! Aberdeen for the football then come home for a nice wee movie and chill night!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-06 16:57:03	My shifts for next week are horrendous
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-09 10:58:11	Oh hey Aberdeen it's been a while
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-10 22:32:54	The past few months have flown in!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-10 22:35:27	Would like this presentation out the way on Wednesday so I don't need to ever talk about caffeine, creatine or steroids ever again!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-11 18:36:24	Spin bikes are not made for the female gender all I'm saying
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-11 18:38:43	Do not approve of what I heard in college today was absolutely vile
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-11 08:47:47	Roll on 5pm!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-11 08:48:07	Spin class this morning is going to be brutal!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-12 21:41:41	Working 33 hours over the next 4 days I just want to sleep 😩
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-12 21:51:45	@paddyc91 no idea I'm just a late night the Friday but I'm a 4-12 on Saturday so  I'll see you at 10
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-12 21:55:51	@paddyc91 I would need someone to do my Sunday shift if I done that
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-14 15:52:04	Last night was so good! Hardly moved all day!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-14 16:09:07	80p drinks are lethal that's all I'm saying
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-14 16:16:24	Someone please tell me why I'm an 8-4 tonight! 😩
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-14 16:27:19	This time next week I'll be in Edinburgh with my mum for her belated birthday present!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-14 18:35:57	So jealous of everyone from my work who's in Amsterdam
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-14 22:39:34	This shift is killing me
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-12 13:29:43	The fact I've passed nutrition and I don't need to do it again makes me so happy!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-15 04:49:39	Did not approve of @TomMcentee10 hitting me over the head with a toffee sauce bottle! 😂 @Xmorganmcdougal
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-12 15:36:55	How the hell do you write a personal statement!!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-15 13:09:26	@Xmorganmcdougal was so funny but it really hurt as well haha
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-15 14:27:42	Finished work at 4 this morning and I'm back there in just under 2 hours

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-18 00:36:27	In hysterics at the picture I just sent Megan and Cara
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-18 00:37:01	College better not drag in tomorrow I won't be happy if it does 😒
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-16 10:03:14	After today's shift I'm coming home and going straight to bed I'm absolutely knackered and done in
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-17 11:38:03	So happy my classes got cancelled today!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-17 15:22:57	Lost my voice again
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-21 14:42:26	Complimentary upgrade from the hotel 👌
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-21 17:04:46	Edinburgh is so much nicer than Glasgow especially with all the. Christmas decorations up

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-20 08:23:25	Early breaks shouldn't be allowed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-22 13:19:08	Quick but lovely time in Edinburgh with my mum for her late birthday present.
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-20 22:01:39	Combat and cxworx tonight has killed me can hardly move
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-26 13:03:29	Would appreciate if my train would hurry up
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-26 13:15:26	Can't deal with how cold it is today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-24 12:14:07	Need to have my ucas application finished for Friday I currently have 130 words for my personal statement 😩
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-25 12:09:02	Told my lecturer not to laugh at my personal statement guarantee he is howling at it
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-26 09:18:24	Cannot be bothered with college today! 😩
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-28 13:03:52	Why is it so difficult to shop for guys 😒
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-28 15:08:02	Not the news I wanted to come home to 😔
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-30 14:01:33	Trying to find the motivation to get ready for work but I don't have any
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-11-29 11:46:19	So lucky to have such supportive people in my life no idea what I'd do without them
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-01 10:56:20	Guy on the train said to have our boarding passes ready I'm pretty sure we aren't on a plane 😒
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-01 15:42:15	Basically going home getting changed then straight back out for work 😒
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-02 00:50:56	Road was shut so had to get Jonny to come and rescue me as I had no clue how to get home. Absolute lifesaver!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-02 19:59:40	I've got just over 2 weeks of college left before Christmas! Thank God!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-03 17:19:43	The cold makes my hair go curly don't know how I feel about this
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-04 09:40:18	Wish I could skip today 😔
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-04 09:54:31	Why am I not in Cyprus right now 😒
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-05 14:00:25	Can't remember that last time I was this unwell 😷
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-07 09:02:52	Got so many things to look forward to!!! 🎉
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-08 12:05:06	Someone on this train is absolutely stinking!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-08 14:27:54	Convinced the pigeons in central are trying to attack me
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-06 16:52:18	Getting sent home an hour early from work is the best thing that could have happened today
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-08 22:47:58	Can it not be the Christmas holidays like now please!!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-10 13:24:24	Can't wait for tonight 😁
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-11 21:46:53	Great hurt my shoulder teaching combat and now can't straighten my arm just fantastic!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-12 07:30:43	I've spent the last 10 minutes trying to defrost my car and it's just not happening
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-12 08:00:03	Would appreciate if they would grit the train station do not approve of the fact I just decked it in front of a train load of people!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-12 08:16:10	A guys just got on my train and he's wearing a Christmas tree on his head and is dressed as Santa..oh my

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-12 22:17:06	Love how I have a Friday off but can't do anything because I'm up at 5 for work 😒
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-13 13:26:48	Suppose to finish work at 3 got sent home at quarter to 1 not bad
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-13 16:05:13	Still can't get over the fact there's an ice cream van going up and down my street playing Christmas songs
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-14 17:20:29	Was made to wear a Santa hat in work and got told I have elf ears....guess who wasn't amused
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-16 22:26:05	Last day of college tomorrow! Thank god!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-15 10:48:14	Knowing once I come home from college I need to sit and spend my night doing more college work makes me want to cry
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-15 16:16:04	Monday's are the most pointless don't think I've done a single bit of work in a Monday class this year
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-15 16:28:30	Actually don't know what I'll do with myself if I don't get into uni
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-17 18:44:16	So happy to be finished college for Christmas!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-18 21:43:44	Combat was so emotional tonight. Can't believe I've gone from standing at the back of the class to teaching it in such a short time!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-19 13:37:54	@EmmaSpringett that's just horrible

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-26 00:05:12	I feel absolutely knackered but the moment I try and sleep I'm wide awake 😒
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-26 16:03:41	Don't like driving in the fog please go away before I need to leave
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-28 15:15:58	It's absolutely freezing I need my bed
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-28 00:49:33	Sleeping with 2 duvets tonight as I'm freezing this cold better shift soon! 😩
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-24 21:04:28	Think my work are trying to kill me with some of these shifts

154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-29 20:24:20	Always doing favours for people and never get anything in return
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-29 21:37:27	Got to the stage that I've just had enough 😔
154646344	rebecca7654	2014-12-30 00:57:26	Love how one person can change your mood! Going to bed happy now! ☺️

154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-02 00:50:51	Today's the first day in ages I've  actually not felt unwell
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-03 11:41:14	You actually do my head in
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-03 13:41:46	My left leg feels like it's constantly about to go into cramp this isn't good
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-05 14:02:23	1st day back at college and I just don't want to be here
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-05 16:12:30	You couldn't be any more obvious if you tried! 😡
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-05 22:12:44	Full day of practical tomorrow including spin just kill me now 😫
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-04 12:31:17	I'm not mentally prepared to go back to college tomorrow 😒🔫
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-05 23:35:09	Rather than doing coursework tonight I looked at dresses for grad ball. Then realised I won't get to go if fail the course
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-05 23:36:28	Clearly have my priorities straight
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-04 17:41:53	Definitely need to move this cold weather isn't for me at all
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-06 07:23:19	Would much rather be curled up in bed where it's warm and not in the freezing cold waiting on a train
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-05 10:42:52	I'm refusing to get out of my bed 😒
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-07 00:19:14	Couldn't be happier right now ☺️
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-07 00:27:58	Said I was going to have an early night tonight that clearly hasn't happened
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-07 19:30:30	Buzzing for airspace!
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-07 23:16:32	Airspace was fab!
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-08 18:12:04	Sorry to all the new people who are coming to combat tonight. It's going to be a rather difficult class 🙊
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-09 14:49:28	The new combat is brutal full upper half of my body is in agony!
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-10 00:39:40	Rooms roasting but can't open my window because of the wind 😫
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-11 22:33:17	This week better go in quickly!
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-11 14:59:04	Graded Unit 3 is awful!
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-12 18:38:47	@aimeeewylie I felt bad breaking that news to you 😥
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-12 00:10:01	Again all the lecturers have had a meeting and decided to give us all our work for the same time 😩🔫
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-12 00:10:58	Take me back to primary when all I had to do was write about my weekend
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-12 21:38:21	Cyprus booked for Easter!! 🎉🎉
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-12 13:57:34	I want to go to the gym tonight but I really need to get this graded unit work done 😫
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-14 00:12:31	Why can't it be Friday!
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-14 00:18:09	Actually forgot just how much pain a spin class causes
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-16 07:44:32	Really need to learn how to reverse park would make things so much easier
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-16 07:49:58	Just decked it in front of everyone at the train station didn't realise it was all icy 😩🔫
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-14 22:43:53	First Thursday in ages I won't need to get up at 4:45. So looking forward to getting a decent sleep
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-16 13:59:55	I actually always overpack go away for a night and have enough to probably last a week
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-15 17:21:48	@heyitshayls if you want to do a wee 2-10 on Sunday I'll do your 6-3 😂

154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-15 23:20:47	Tomorrow will be my first Friday in college in like 4 or 5 weeks safe to say I have no clue what I'm doing in those classes!
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-18 15:18:29	Can't get my car out of my street so my mum now needs to drive me to work
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-17 21:38:12	My mum actually comes away with the most inappropriate comments
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-17 21:41:27	So many things happening this year. It's going to be the best!!
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-18 13:24:03	The thought of working at 6 makes me want to cry
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-19 09:39:45	Mondays are the most pointless days at college we never do any work!
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-19 10:41:58	Right I'm pretty sure the inside of my windscreen should not be frozen
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-19 10:56:44	I mean there's ice inside my car
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-20 09:09:49	Today is not a day that I want to be doing spin! ✋
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-20 09:28:54	I want to be in my bed right now not getting ready to take spin! I hate Tuesdays!
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-20 17:37:36	Report due tomorrow and have no clue how to do part of it!
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-22 23:08:58	I'm hooked on watching Blacklist!
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-23 12:10:51	The conductor on my train is fully inspecting it like she's lying on the ground looking under the seats
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-23 14:32:01	I go to cyprus in 75 days!! April needs to hurry up 🎉🎉

154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-25 12:54:19	Feel like I'm going to pass out every 2 seconds, work is going to be fun
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-24 18:30:07	My mums actually making me my dinner tonight she never makes it as I'm too fussy
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-27 19:09:33	Will be asking ucas for a refund if I get 5 rejections
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-27 23:34:08	Why do I live in this country...I need the sun in my life
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-27 23:38:13	The comments my dad comes away with at times are rather inappropriate
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-29 22:04:35	I think combat is slowly killing me. Had to sit out again because I felt faint 😔
154646344	rebecca7654	2015-01-31 11:27:26	Semi-Final Day!
