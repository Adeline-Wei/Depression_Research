157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2013-05-17 09:03:11	I opened my chemistry paper and there was a 35 mark essay question on the structure and properties of various materials
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2013-05-17 09:03:48	I was convinced it was Dorotheou playing some kind of sick joke on me
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2013-05-17 09:53:45	It was almost as bad as my pre results day dream last year when I opened my letter to 3 blank sheets of paper

157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 16:04:22	evidently not true given Britain's political history  https://t.co/cCfSAsW4cd
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 16:24:00	I read through the bulk of the UKIP manifesto and it really is worrying how anyone, especially in our generation can take it seriously
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 16:24:33	an actual joke http://t.co/kMzgo4oEiq
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 16:24:55	they honestly opened a paragraph by downright stating 'we reject multiculturalism'
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 16:25:07	didn't even try to dress it up tbh
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 16:27:23	minimum pricing on alcohol and smoking indoors 😔
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 16:31:41	@tom_chapp not everyday bants
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 16:39:39	@HaydnCarrington yeah but even that's a huge risk in itself and they haven't even got any other decent policies to make it worthwhile
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 16:40:35	@M_JPotter this isn't even a non smokers point of view loool, just think its unnecessary to bring back the social stigma associated with it
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 16:46:54	@M_JPotter mate I work in a pub so don't worry yourself over my sense of British culture, everyone enjoys pubs I just think the ban on
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 16:48:23	@M_JPotter smoking indoors is completely justified and shouldn't be in a manifesto, as well as minimising the price of alcohol
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 16:51:57	@M_JPotter getting personal is definitely the best way to get your point across loool
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 16:52:55	@M_JPotter I have a complete appreciation of British culture, but I also appreciate other peoples cultures which is where we differ
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 16:56:48	@M_JPotter smoking indoors/drinking cheap booze isnt the epitome of British culture. Surely you'd want to look out for their health anyway?
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 17:04:39	@M_JPotter NHS is definitely more important, but other parties would do a good job of protecting it such as Labour and Liberal Democrats
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-06 22:30:19	Getting so excited now most of inter railing is sorted 🎉
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 17:05:35	@M_JPotter who have also discussed increasing mental health care too, which is why I think they'd do a better job than UKIP at improving it
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 17:15:49	@M_JPotter it's undoubtedly something to be proud of however there is definitely room for improvement, and more is becoming privatised. A&amp;e
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 17:16:23	@M_JPotter needs improving and many medications given out on prescription are for conditions that can all be helped by lifestyle choices
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 17:16:32	@M_JPotter which goes back to my previous point
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 17:16:57	@M_JPotter (smoking indoors etc)
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 17:17:57	@M_JPotter overpopulation is a global issue, people are living longer and the number of people wanting kids hasn't decreased.
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 17:18:35	@M_JPotter when you go outside of London, there really aren't many people of ethnic minorities
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 17:22:25	@M_JPotter encouraging people to make better lifestyle choices goes a long way, that way tax money isn't spent on huge numbers of people
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 17:22:42	@M_JPotter on medication when it could have been prevented way before
157602777	LydiaLahouasnia	2015-05-07 17:28:09	@M_JPotter appreciating British pride is definitely fair, just think there are more pressing issues. But yeah agree to disagree
