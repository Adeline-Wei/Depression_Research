1611116828	richardr0924	2015-01-30 00:47:49	In early Alpha stages of #marketapp! Be sure to support us at http://t.co/MJgUPhhlop http://t.co/iSOJTqBWlX
1611116828	richardr0924	2015-01-30 02:25:27	@RogersHelps The first tip should be: Dump Rogers and switch to @Bell. Half the time the internet doesn't work so I'm forced to use my data
1611116828	richardr0924	2015-01-30 02:26:00	@RogersHelps You guys really suck. If the Internet won't work at least don't charge outrageous data fees
1611116828	richardr0924	2015-01-30 03:14:29	@RogersHelps Well, first off the internet actually works about Â¼ of the time, and when it does work it is extremely slow. Takes about...
1611116828	richardr0924	2015-01-30 03:15:25	@RogersHelps ... ~2 minutes for a web page to load. Secondly, when the internet does not work I'm forced to use my data, which is still...
1611116828	richardr0924	2015-01-30 03:16:22	@RogersHelps ...extremely slow. And most of the time I end up going above my limited data limit and end up paying outrageous fees
1611116828	richardr0924	2015-01-30 14:12:49	@RogersHelps I have the Hybrid Fibre 150 550 GB package with the latest Rogers Modem. The router I use is an Apple AirPort Extreme
1611116828	richardr0924	2015-01-29 02:12:33	Ultimate Center - Coming soon TM (not actually TM though) It's currently a work in progress as you can see. http://t.co/GxavmscKua
1611116828	richardr0924	2015-02-02 20:45:55	@markgurman @9to5mac What's wrong with an icon that just shows the face of the ï£¿Watch instead of the whole skeumorphic physical design?
