1651924723	TrentMalone97	2014-08-20 04:27:18	@WHill65 well that's cause you do you idiot
1651924723	TrentMalone97	2014-08-20 04:29:38	@WHill65 are you kidding me then why when a cop shows up does your foot magically get heavier and rev the engine
1651924723	TrentMalone97	2014-08-20 04:34:47	@WHill65 no wade you always do it when ever you see a cop heaven forbid they actually pull you over for harassing them for once
1651924723	TrentMalone97	2014-08-20 04:30:25	@WHill65 are you being serious right now
1651924723	TrentMalone97	2014-08-20 04:31:56	@WHill65 then how does the engine just rev uncontrollably then when you go by a cop
1651924723	TrentMalone97	2014-08-20 04:36:03	@WHill65 I think you aren't admitting it cause I told you it would happen but you didn't seem to think it would
1651924723	TrentMalone97	2014-08-20 04:37:59	@WHill65 no but from  riding with you anywhere I know you do that so it's pretty easy to assume that you did so that
1651924723	TrentMalone97	2014-08-20 04:40:11	@WHill65 whatever obviously you can't just admit that you are a dick to police officers for doing there job
1651924723	TrentMalone97	2014-08-20 04:41:36	@WHill65 wade no I don't I do know that you are a cock to cops though
1651924723	TrentMalone97	2014-08-20 04:44:37	@WHill65 I done here you obviously just can't admit that you actually did something wrong
1651924723	TrentMalone97	2014-08-20 04:46:37	@WHill65 harassment is illegal though
1651924723	TrentMalone97	2014-08-20 04:47:46	@WHill65 ok wade whatever you say you perfect little child you
