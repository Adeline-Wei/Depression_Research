165807638	infinityarchery	2015-05-19 21:15:29	@timlaw77 @GrizzlyArchery just keep practicing, sounds a bit mad.... But imagine something beyond the target face.
165807638	infinityarchery	2015-05-19 21:18:04	@timlaw77  in my case I imagine archery battle scenes and I aim for  the foot soldiers or knights. It works well for me.

165807638	infinityarchery	2015-05-19 17:53:38	@timlaw77 @GrizzlyArchery both open for better depth/distance perception. In my opinion, hope it helps.
165807638	infinityarchery	2015-05-19 17:54:30	@timlaw77 there is no such thing as a silly question, only curiosity.
