1681348927	Englewood58	2013-09-08 18:33:59	@dan_bernstein  Agreed. ..doesn't look good
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-09-08 18:40:22	@Ecnerwal23 Can anyone stick A.J Green?   This will be a blow out in the second half.  Bad start for the Bears...7-9 Record for year.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-09-08 18:45:18	@Ecnerwal23 where is Peppers???
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-09-08 18:47:31	@dan_bernstein This game is all but over...Bears outclassed. ..NO PLAYOFFS THIS YEAR.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-09-08 18:50:51	Call Brian Urlacher this defense sucks...A.J Green to the Hall of Fame.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-09-08 18:57:21	@RealMikeWilbon when does the Bulls season start? Football season is over in Chicago.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-09-08 19:00:34	@LaurenceWHolmes When does the Bulls season start?  This will be long bad year for the Bears. 7-9 at best.  #Call Urlacher
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-09-08 19:02:36	@dan_bernstein Thet like watching A.J Green play catch. They do that very well.

1681348927	Englewood58	2013-09-29 18:39:56	@LaurenceWHolmes Lovies defense's wouldn't have looked this bad.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-09-29 18:48:07	@LaurenceWHolmes  Same players yes but l want Bears fans to wait a few games before they put Trestman in the Hall of Fame.

1681348927	Englewood58	2013-10-07 01:47:45	@Rob_Farrow  Must be the same writers that ruined Dexter.   I just hope the writers have a plan but as of now I can't see it.

1681348927	Englewood58	2013-10-06 18:26:35	@LaurenceWHolmes Time to start raking leaves.   The Bears cannot stop Brees.  Where is Peppers...is he playing?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-10-06 18:53:11	@LaurenceWHolmes When you listen to the score after the game listen to how the bear fans blame Lovie.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-10-11 01:32:02	@BradBiggs Are the Bears that tired?

1681348927	Englewood58	2013-10-14 15:20:27	@mikebearup17 I hope your right but black coaches are held to a different standard.  Remember Ty Willingham at ND.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-10-14 15:29:30	@mullyhanley Yes but all I can think about is will they do him like Ty Willingham. ...I know this isn't  backward ND but just saying
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-10-15 02:37:07	@mikebearup17 I agree to a certain point.  Before Pete Carroll USC had a long drought also with the sun and women.

1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-05 04:44:30	@RaferWeigel Steroids do work...Shea McClellan needs to keep taking them.

1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 06:44:03	@LaurenceWHolmes The Bulls are officially in basketball hell.Blow it up and start over again and hope to get another top draft pick. PARKER?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 06:46:18	@CSNBullsInsider Blow it up and start over again. Rose is damaged goods. Let's hope for a good draft pick.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 06:49:33	@SamSmithHoops The season is over.  Trade and start over again.Rose will never be the same. IT IS OVER LOOK FOR THE BOUNCING LOTTERY PICKS
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 06:55:05	@Jason1Goff The season is over. Bulls are officially in basketball hell. Tear it down and start over again. Look for a lottery pick.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 06:55:57	@Jason1Goff Drose is done damaged goods. We have to move on.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 12:47:50	@Jason1Goff Really. ..you know what I mean. Name me a player in NBA history who was successful after two ACL injuries.  I love Rose but it's
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 12:57:00	@ESPN_Colin Do you think it's time for the Bulls tp move on? Can a player come back after two ACLs?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 13:04:45	@SamSmithHoops I'm praying. ..for him to be ok.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 16:59:58	@dan_bernstein  Do you think the Bulls should blow it up and start over again?  Trade players and hope for Parker or that kid from Kansas.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 20:22:43	@AdamHoge The Big Ten is a painful conference to watch. High School football is a better watch.Purdue, Indiana, Northwestern, Minnesota.BAD
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 12:53:49	@SportsCenter I hope he's ok.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 15:05:48	@OhioStFootball Enjoy your day playing a division 3 school.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 20:15:08	@MattSpiegel670 Absolutely,  tear it down and start over again.  Try for Jabari Parker or that kid from Kansas.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 20:18:02	@OhioStFootball I hope OSU play a big boy schedule next year.  Indiana is a high school team. Big Ten is awful.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 22:54:43	@ProFootballDoc what's the timetable?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 22:55:17	@_dannykerr what's the timetable for return?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-23 22:58:08	@_dannykerr How long will he be out?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-24 13:55:06	@dan_bernstein Rose is now damaged goods. Probably will never be the same again.  Do Bulls blow it up or stick with current roster?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-24 14:00:26	@dan_bernstein  Start over and play for the lottery. The window has closed. Just hope the balls bounce your way and you can get Parker.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-24 21:33:06	@AdamHoge That money we was going to pay Cutler spend it on a defense.Do what you want with Cutler but don't pay him DEFENSE.DEFENSE.DEFENSE
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-24 22:06:08	@MattSpiegel670 WORSE IS THE CORRECT SPELLING
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-24 23:47:20	@chicagotribune  At this point who cares.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-24 23:57:02	@nbcchicago Start from scratch, trade Boozer Deng and Kirk and hope for the top draft pick.  The window has closed on the Rose era.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-24 23:57:44	@bomani_jones Cold fine...
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-24 23:58:38	@SportsCenter It only gets worse for the Bulls.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-24 23:59:38	@dan_bernstein Some of the play calling was bad also.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-25 00:12:36	@SamSmithHoops It only gets worse.  Trade big contracts and start over.  Maybe we get top draft pick.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-25 02:54:27	@Samantha1438 I agree Dana shouldn't be in this series.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-25 02:56:12	@HeidiNYBO I'm still trying to figure this out. ..why Dana is relevant.    Also this plan will never work.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-25 02:57:34	@Lady0fRage What it has...
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-25 03:02:59	@Lady0fRage The last three have been great. ..the writing has improved vastly.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-27 03:01:59	@ZachZaidman The reason that there so bad is  because they put the stadium almost in another state.   Who the hell can get to Rosemont.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-26 01:38:57	@WGNTV I've watched my last Bulls basketball game this year.  This is to depressing.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-26 03:06:55	@WGNTV What? ?? I'm just saying the Bulls need to rebuild and start over. Go for the lottery pick.You must be an overly optimistic cub fan.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-27 03:06:08	@ZachZaidman DePaul will not be better until they move back into the city. Inner city kids can't relate to a team in Rosemont.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-27 03:10:59	@Kerryepp Why did they get rid of Tarij Henson?  She was good.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-27 03:14:35	@TherealTaraji Your still on the show right?  This has to be a mistake.  If so the show will not last.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-27 14:19:31	@Espngreeny Did Golic vote for Manti Teo last year knowing he had issues and was not telling the truth? He did...
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-27 14:22:36	@MikeAndMike Did you vote for Manti Teo last year knowing he didn't tell the truth and had issues prior.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-28 02:13:37	@LaurenceWHolmes He runs real fast. ..
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-28 18:11:30	@LaurenceWHolmes Does it matter?  The Bears defense couldn't stop Mt.Carmel High School so they will definitely lose rhe next few weeks.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-28 20:57:09	@Espngreeny Let me interrupt but Jay Z is the most overrated rapper ever.Dre has a better resume.He benefited from the deaths of Pac and Big
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-28 23:09:56	@allhiphopcom The GOD MC of course Rakim Allah.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-28 23:12:37	@RaferWeigel  Who??? The Bears have no answer for A.P.  This will get ugly.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-28 23:15:04	@MotherJones I don't believe it...Do the dougnuts have vitamins?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-29 00:12:47	@JalenRose I agree.  I think Jay Z is overrated. He really benefited from Biggie and Tupac passing. His resume is not better than Dre.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-02 02:35:09	I knew this plan wouldn't work.  Homeland is backwards. Whose writing this stuff.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-02 02:36:49	@SHO_Homeland  whose writing this stuff.  This plan was doomed from the start.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-02 02:47:22	@SHO_Homeland I thought this show was an hour.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-03 23:21:14	@AmeshiaCross Maybe,  but its mainly black on black.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-04 02:36:05	@dan_bernstein  If this was the NBA I wonder if the public would accept fighting like they do in hockey.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-29 14:38:12	@schadjoe Why ask such a silly question?  Auburn,  of course.  The Big 10 except OSU is almost a high school conference.  No chance for UM.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-29 19:20:13	@NDFootball If ND gets a BCS bowl bid that will be a tragedy of justice.  Everyone will know the fix is in. This team has no buzz.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-30 03:13:26	@stephenasmith To much to soon. Maybe should have started as an assistant.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-30 14:15:28	@OhioStFootball Who cares??? This game is a 4 touchdown blowout.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-30 14:58:34	@jemelehill Wow...I wonder who he is going to pick.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-30 17:35:11	@USATODAY This guy is going to be broke.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-30 20:06:16	@rolandsmartin I agree bad football
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-30 20:09:56	@rolandsmartin He's an idiot.  Johnny Manziel would win this game.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-30 20:12:25	@rolandsmartin Gardner better work on his degree.  That NFL dream may be just that....a dream.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-30 20:20:21	@cbfowler They shouldn't worry. .just run the ball.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-30 20:24:38	@Jason1Goff Brady Hoke had the nerve to say he wouldn't take Johnny Football over Gardner.Gardner better get his degree. NFL is a pipe dream
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-30 20:35:37	@SI_PeterKing Why??? He is an idiot.  KICK THE BALL
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-30 06:19:02	@SethDavisHoops This kid was number 1? Well its still early.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-30 14:23:36	@Brewster50 Michigan is a division 3 team. This will be a bad game. At least 4 touchdowns.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-30 14:57:56	@CollegeGameDay Wow...I wonder who he is going to pick. ..
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-01 04:57:44	@ESPNRobertSmith Is March madness less exciting?  PLEASE. ..We need a playoff.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-11-30 20:04:58	@Jason1Goff Michigan is horrible. ..this guy lost the game.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-01 17:31:48	@jemelehill The SEC can't be left out. Auburn,  Bama, Mizzou...
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-01 17:34:12	@BleacherReport Why, Auburn will jump them in the rankings
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-01 17:37:08	@jemelehill MSU BETTER NOT BLOW THIS OPPORTUNITY.  OSU GAVE UP OVER 500 YARDS TO UM. THEY CAN BEAT THIS OVERRATED TEAM.  DO IT FOR THE SEC!
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-05 10:51:04	@chicagobulls To say what?   He's hurt and will be back in a year.  We know.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 01:40:52	@RealJoeNamath Just the offense. ...
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 01:51:32	@bomani_jones Wow your right but thinking it wasn't that long ago...only about 28 years.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 01:55:00	@MattSpiegel670 MSU really looks like an inferior team. . It's just a matter of time  before OSU takes over.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 14:13:31	@thepoes2 WHAT???? OSU had the worst schedule on college football.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 14:18:05	@WholeFoods Sorry but everything is over priced and I can't afford it.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-07 03:28:48	@Jason1Goff It's hard to gamble on former Duke players.  No heart.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 01:34:55	@rolandsmartin MSU is not a top notch team. That should have been a touchdown. Also the QB Cook is awful and has the form of a HS QB.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 03:23:04	@mullyhanley 2005 seems like 1905.CWS has to win another WS Title.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 03:31:53	@ImTaylorRooks This guy B Miller is a running back that throws the ball sometimes.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 03:34:22	@SportsCenter OSU has better players that's obvious. MSU QB Cook is awful.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 03:37:15	@MattSpiegel670 yep..MSU is done. ..I can hear choking from the MSU sidelines.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 04:01:45	@DesmondHoward No, MSU is overrated.  Has not beat a top 25 ranked team all year. This game is over. Cook is an awful athlete.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 04:05:31	@OhioStFootball If MSU is ranked 10 the big ten is awful. This game is over.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 04:09:40	@rolandsmartin I agree.  What an overrated sport.  Cannot watch but is robbing boxing of good athletes.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 04:12:52	@BlockONation Please. ..MSU has not beat a top 25 team this year. Top defense my a**.  Who have they beat?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 04:14:11	@jemelehill I could have told you that.  MSU has not beat a too 25 team all year.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 04:18:28	@DesmondHoward Why...because he is a bum.  Not a big time QB.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-07 14:38:10	@msnbc That has to be the stupidest thing I ever heard. WOW
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-07 15:00:41	@GottliebShow Have you been smoking this morning?   Put the pipe down.   Missouri,  Duke to cover and OSU big?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-10 03:45:08	@WhitlockJason I have...let Cutler go and draft a young QB.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 21:45:06	@Jason1Goff Ok so let's pay Cutler big money and watch.  Please,  this guy is a fraud. He is no real QB. Look at the almost 10 yrs of tape.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 22:00:04	@HuffingtonPost Good article.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-08 23:48:11	@EBONYMag Totally overrated rapper.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-09 02:28:04	@SHO_Homeland This plan is sure to fail...can't see it working.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-09 02:35:15	@SHO_Homeland  That was a great counterplan. Where is the weapon?  Is it in his pocket.  He better ditch it.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-09 02:39:13	@SHO_Homeland  Why is this show so short?  Doesn't it supposed to be an hour?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-09 02:43:08	@SHO_Homeland Carrie is an idiot. Why would you send a pregnant crazy women on this mission.   She will blow this.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-09 02:46:31	@SHO_Homeland How and why do they trust Carrie?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-09 02:52:46	@SHO_Homeland Who wrote this shit??? Crazy. ..Now what your going to do?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-09 02:58:58	@SHO_Homeland Who knows? ?? DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW ITS GOING TO END?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-09 03:15:42	@AdamHoge Just wondering. ..who did Notre Dame pay off to get those special perks from the BCS?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-09 03:22:18	@OhioStAthletics So...but they always lose big games.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-13 01:53:40	@ZachZaidman Allstate arena is a horrible place to watch a game.   DePaul has to move back to the city.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-15 19:13:20	@zachbraff I definitely agree but where do the writers go with the script now?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-15 20:13:16	@dan_bernstein We will now see BAD JAY CUTLER the rest of the way.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-15 20:16:41	@1901Madison CAN'T BLAME CUTLER??? What game have you been watching.   This guy has given Cleveland  most of there points.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-15 20:27:02	@dan_bernstein If they score on this drive the game is over.  The Bears can't rally with Cutler throwing.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-15 20:59:55	@dan_bernstein Are you thinking a Cutler pick six.?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-16 02:00:43	@TimGuinee This should be confusingly good.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-16 02:21:50	@CinemaReel So what happened?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-16 02:25:16	@HecklerForever What happened?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-16 02:58:46	@thetwinkieaward Your right. ..homeland can't recover from this bad writing.  Well it was a good three years.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-16 03:14:52	@TimGuinee How...they killed off Brodie.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-23 00:57:03	@JalenRose There's always the Pistons...
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-23 01:28:45	@AdamHoge Why do you think. ..I think it's a mistake.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-23 01:55:47	@Red_Sniper0 Two words Jay Cutler
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-23 01:58:30	@LaurenceWHolmes One more score and the Bears should rest their starters and prepare for Rodgers and the Packers.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-23 02:11:03	@BradBiggs Stop it..of course Rodgers will play next week.  His mouth is watering watching the Bears defense.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-24 13:33:03	@rolandsmartin Very. ..if this is true then what's the problem with the young black males?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-24 17:48:28	@SELFMADE_G22 My concern is black males and how we are perceived. Over 300 homicides in Chicago last year most by black males.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-24 19:42:18	@allhiphopcom  facing jail for bad hip hop...no rap skills.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-25 01:16:19	@WhitlockJason Should win an Oscar.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-25 19:08:55	@WarrenSapp The Bulls will win two playoff series win Rose returns.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-25 21:38:15	@ReggieMillerTNT I don't understand it either.  I'm tired of the NBA pushing the Knicks down everyone throats.  This is a bad franchise.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-22 01:39:48	@chicagobulls It's hard to watch this years Bulls.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-23 01:30:53	@AP Great story. .
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-23 01:36:20	@dan_bernstein Just had a nightmare that the Bears lose and Aaron Rodgers returns and mauls the Bears and win the division.  DAMM DAMM DAMM
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-23 01:38:34	@AdamHoge Mcoy may have 200 yards tonight.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-23 01:41:25	@BradBiggs Just had a bad vision that the Bears lose and Aaron Rodgers returns and passes for 400 yards and win the division.  DAMM!!!!
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-23 01:43:20	What else is on T.V.  This is bad already. Lets play for next week.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-23 01:49:29	@dan_bernstein Game over. ..now its time for the Cutler picks and turnovers.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-23 01:54:57	@LaurenceWHolmes I think you're right.  This is shaping up to be another Green Bay heart break for the Bears.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-23 02:22:23	@RealSkipBayless They might just do that.
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-23 02:23:18	@JoeO670 Why not?
1681348927	Englewood58	2013-12-23 02:34:31	@RealMikeWilbon You shouldn't be surprised. Cutler is a third rate QB. Game plan for next week. This ones over.  Rodgers wil play next week.

1681348927	Englewood58	2014-05-27 01:32:12	@fox32news Who cares.   I hate the Cubs.
1681348927	Englewood58	2014-06-07 15:03:46	@WindyCityLIVE Yes,  cut the grass.  Very exciting.
1681348927	Englewood58	2014-06-07 23:21:08	@bomani_jones This guy is an IDIOT why allow yourself to be pimped? He could have took hard classes and did the right thing.

1681348927	Englewood58	2014-06-30 02:35:30	@SeatGeek Why...who wants to go to a Cubs game.
1681348927	Englewood58	2014-06-29 03:59:43	@DesmondHoward Thank you GREAT POINT.  MMA IS CHECKERS AND BOXING IS CHESS.  THAT CRAP DOESN'T COME CLOSE TO BOXING.
1681348927	Englewood58	2014-07-01 00:41:32	@LaurenceWHolmes @whitesox @670TheScore  Talk about DRose and his HORRIBLE advisors.  What is he thinking?  You haven't played in two years!
1681348927	Englewood58	2014-06-30 22:24:13	@fox32news Please. ..give it three more weeks when football kicks into gear.  World Cup Soccer will be a distant memory for another 4 years.

1681348927	Englewood58	2014-07-08 03:01:57	@jbrd77 @BenBradleyABC7  And turn off Fox News.
1681348927	Englewood58	2014-07-08 20:40:01	@Boers_Bernstein The incentive would be free White Sox tickets.
1681348927	Englewood58	2014-07-08 04:35:17	@SInow WHY? ?? Max money down the drain.
1681348927	Englewood58	2014-07-10 10:43:21	@amtvmedia Great point.  He may be guilty but when everyone around him in power is doing much worse he may have felt he could do the same.

1681348927	Englewood58	2014-07-13 20:31:32	@bomani_jones This crap will never catch on in the United States. They have been playing over an hour and no score.  Don't get it.

1681348927	Englewood58	2014-07-15 12:08:06	@LanceBrennan We didn't have over the top tributes for these players in every city  Ozzie Smith or Cal Ripkin didn't get this kind treatment
1681348927	Englewood58	2014-07-15 12:17:01	@LanceBrennan Makes no sense. He is a great player but not a WOW player always a low key no personality type.  Do the tributes only in NYC.

1681348927	Englewood58	2014-07-16 15:04:01	@670TheScore Please no more stories about Jeter.  I don't understand all the hype.  We didn't do this for Griffey,  Ripkin or Ozzie.

1681348927	Englewood58	2014-07-16 16:23:56	@runCMC_22 Jeter is not washed up? If this guy had played anywhere but New York we wouldn't be having this conversation. NYC BIAS,OVERRATED!

1681348927	Englewood58	2014-07-16 22:37:48	@FunSkipBayless  Thanks.I can't listen to another Jeter tribute. He's a good player but If he played in Kansas city or Cincinnati NOTHING.

1681348927	Englewood58	2014-07-30 03:48:09	@ESPN_Colin Colin,Why do the cliche stuff in Chicago?Go to an OVERRATED WRIGLEY FIELD and sing. No national guys ever come to the south side
1681348927	Englewood58	2014-07-30 03:51:03	@ESPN_Colin The White Sox are the only team in the city with a WorldSeries Title and no one knows about it outside Chicago.Wrigley is a dump
1681348927	Englewood58	2014-07-30 03:58:44	@ESPN_Colin These idiots aren't baseball fans. Most of them just drinking having a good time.  Wrigley is bad for baseball

1681348927	Englewood58	2014-08-03 02:30:59	@NinaRivers_XIII @coachty @Power_Starz Not a happy ending but one that's plausible.
1681348927	Englewood58	2014-08-03 02:46:32	@CKAgbohOfficial @Power_Starz @ActorVinicius There was no official word of that. I bet he will survive.

1681348927	Englewood58	2014-08-03 03:08:49	@TonyaPendleton @CKAgbohOfficial You think?  I done know. Look at the series the Wire.  Every season was new and fresh and not unfulfilling

1681348927	Englewood58	2014-08-04 04:03:07	@ninoacosta2 @NotRickHahn Sorry he's batting 225. Beckham's should have been traded or let go.

1681348927	Englewood58	2014-08-16 02:42:08	@rolandsmartin @goldietaylor Can we use this situation to tell young blacks how to act and react. Lose the thug life crap.
1681348927	Englewood58	2014-08-17 17:58:14	@darrenrovell I would have said the same thing.

1681348927	Englewood58	2014-08-23 04:04:02	@MattBowen41 Well we can stop talking about the the Bears being a Super bowl team.  Hopefully a playoff team.

1681348927	Englewood58	2015-06-08 03:23:06	@Jason1Goff What? Put the pipe down. I don't think GS can do this 3 more games.
