1696625706	KailaLars10	2014-05-02 03:24:40	Always being the second choice really sucks... I'm never enough😔
1696625706	KailaLars10	2014-05-02 03:57:55	Miss having someone to talk to when I felt like this..
1696625706	KailaLars10	2014-04-30 22:17:39	I'm not the kind of person to hold a grudge. If you upset me I'll say what I have to say but then it's fine I move on, no reason to stay mad

1696625706	KailaLars10	2014-05-03 16:47:10	No farewell words were spoken no time to say goodbye you were gone before I knew it and only God knows why
1696625706	KailaLars10	2014-05-05 04:04:59	I finally worked up the courage to speak up about it all &amp; you didn't even hear me out...😔
1696625706	KailaLars10	2014-05-05 04:25:24	It's scary sometimes how good I am at faking "okay"
1696625706	KailaLars10	2014-05-03 00:29:00	Hold me so I'm not falling apart🎶🎶

1696625706	KailaLars10	2014-05-14 01:49:46	It's crazy how different 2 people's perspectives can be about each other
1696625706	KailaLars10	2014-05-11 02:34:59	I probably have either a nickname or code word for literally everyone I know🙈😂

1696625706	KailaLars10	2014-05-14 02:25:21	You stopped caring about me as a person &amp; in turn I learned to stop caring whether you cared
1696625706	KailaLars10	2014-05-14 04:10:35	OTH why you gotta make me so emotional?😰😭
1696625706	KailaLars10	2014-05-13 00:17:13	I always get blinded by personalities, I expect the best in people &amp; maybe that's where I go wrong
1696625706	KailaLars10	2014-05-13 02:41:31	Everyone has their struggle, some are just better at hiding it than others
1696625706	KailaLars10	2014-05-13 05:22:57	I wish I didn't have to think so much at night😔
1696625706	KailaLars10	2014-05-13 21:58:18	Promote what you love instead of bashing what you hate
