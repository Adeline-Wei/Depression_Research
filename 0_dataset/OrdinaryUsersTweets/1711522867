1711522867	livelyjai	2014-03-23 18:50:46	@troyeselfies why do you hate him?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-03-23 18:53:33	@troyeselfies but it was his opinion and it's really idiotic for a girl to hear that and think they have to meet that standard.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-03-23 18:56:37	@troyeselfies I was saying it stupid on the girls part to listen to what he said, he was being stupid but apologized for it.It's in the past

1711522867	livelyjai	2014-03-27 23:26:48	I feel like I will never get a @JacobWhitesides follow 😞 I can't give up hope tho
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-03-28 00:04:11	I'm so scared if magcon ever comes here and I don't get tickets.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-03-28 13:56:18	Everyone is like "be happy it's Friday" but I can't when I still have to get through 6 hours of classes 😑
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-03-28 15:26:31	There was a big ass spider under my table in math class and suddenly it disappeared. Pretty sure it's like in my backpack or something 😫

1711522867	livelyjai	2014-03-31 22:09:05	The fact that Matt wears a uniform to school gives me life.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-03-31 22:24:50	I HEARD THAT 5SOS WAS ON THE MOST POPULAR RADIO STATION IN SEATTLE A FEW MINUTES AGO 😱 YOU DONT KNOW HOW PROUD I AM.

1711522867	livelyjai	2014-03-31 23:53:31	My 12 year old cousin just posted Hayes as her #mcm 😑😑 ugh

1711522867	livelyjai	2014-03-31 19:08:20	It makes me so mad when people actually hate on the guys for hanging with girls like that's so idiotic. What is your problem.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-01 21:29:20	Sitting outside my school, on a bench, eating a baguette.

1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-02 13:39:18	Carter does something that he knows he will get hate for, and then wonders why he got hate for it.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-02 13:46:16	Carter deletes 85% of his tweets.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-01 18:48:12	My whole timeline is SPAMMMMM

1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-04 21:15:35	“@JacobWhitesides: I'd never date a girl unless she was a fangirl. 💯” 
I'm in love with you.

1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-04 22:39:10	It's honestly so weird how Lindsay clearly hated on Carter but he just forgets that and she is suddenly "his girl"
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-04 22:40:43	I'm just really nervous. Be 5 o'clock already
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-04 22:47:29	It scares me when people draw on their eyebrows and make them extremely big 😳
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-04 22:57:10	Espinosa is such a cool last name tbh
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-05 04:56:48	We're a family not a fandom.

1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-03 00:43:47	The emojis that someone uses really depicts their personality these days.

1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-07 00:38:18	It makes me sad when someone gets noticed more than once by the boys because there are so many of us. It needs to be shared.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-07 01:17:30	@taylorcaniff 😭 I'm so sorry Taylor. Really hope you get better soon babe.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-07 01:57:19	@sampottorff yeahhhhh

1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-09 04:31:48	So jealous of everyone who gets attention from @JacobWhitesides
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-09 04:34:27	How the hell is Jacob so good at selfies. The big difference between my selfie skills and his is sad.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-09 04:34:48	@TheMattEspinosa thanks for the clarification.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-09 04:35:27	@JacobWhitesides all I want is to be on your timeline, it would make my life.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-09 04:39:08	I want a @JacobWhitesides follow so bad and i have hope that one day it will happen.

1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-11 05:04:55	I hate when teachers assign stupid project/presentations that NO ONE wants to do.

1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 03:27:59	@mendeslayed jack g tweeted it
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 03:29:15	What does this mean for magcon Atlanta? Are they all coming or?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 03:31:12	@mendeslayed ya I guess he did delete it
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 04:24:29	I feel like the guys should've made a video or smthin besides just saying smthin this big thru twitter, and all of them didn't know about it
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 04:59:06	Today made me realize how much magcon really means to me
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:00:54	Tbh I thought that magcon would at least last a year.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:03:30	@jccaylen CONGRATS JC I LOVE YOU DARLING 💕
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:04:57	They should've made some kind of announcement that magcon nj was gunna be the last altogether
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:05:57	Haha people are blocking bart wtf why haha
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:07:06	@grierokay @ShawnSexpinosa @BartBordelon bart thought of this original idea just for fans to meet their idols
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:09:11	@12cheer4life34 @shirtlessshawn so sad 😭
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:10:02	I actually did think that magcon would one day come to Seattle 😞
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:11:03	@ShawnSexpinosa when did nash say that bart was taking advantage if him?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:12:39	@ShawnSexpinosa omg that's crazy
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:15:58	All the bart girls are probably so conflicted right now.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-17 23:23:38	I thought Jacobs tool pic would be like of his torso
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-17 23:35:49	OMG I wonder what color taylor is getting in his hair.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 00:13:12	@jccaylen #JcTo1Million #JcTo1Mil 

JC TO 1 MILLION
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:16:51	WAIT WHAT IS CARTER TALKING ABOUT?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:18:00	@jkcamdallass OMFG WHAT HOW WHO SAID THIS?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:18:36	What am I hearing right now. People are leaving magcon what is happening?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:19:43	@jkcamdallass WHAT THE HELL WHERE DID YOU HEAR THIS?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:20:19	Is this legit or a rumor cuz I'm dying
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:24:11	Taylor saying that he is still here just warms my heart to the max.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:25:11	But magcon won't be magcon with out all the family members.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:26:28	I'm honestly dying over the fact that carter is leaving. If magcon were to ever come to Seattle, he was one that I was most excited about.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:27:17	Magcon literally hasn't even been going for a year yet. 😞 the fact that I might never see them is crushing
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:28:23	@JacobWhitesides no way that we can stay calm
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:28:44	@flirtyxespinosa jack j and Hayes and carter are for sure
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:29:47	This better not be a fucking just bc to many emotions are happening right now.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:30:41	If cameron leaves magcon then I will probably drown in tears
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:31:27	@camerondallas but it won't ever be the same and I never got to go 😭
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:31:58	Why did they decide to do this to us tonight?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:33:10	It needs to be a joke, please be a joke please
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 14:10:29	@JacobWhitesides I love ya jacob
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:34:04	Why would they leave like wtf better opportunities, magcon is one of the most special opportunities out there.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:48:28	I feel like jack Johnson is really unappreciative of us. Just my opinion.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 02:50:33	I will never not love Jacob he is the sweetest person on earth.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 03:04:19	MY EMOTIONS ARE SO UP AND DOWN
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 03:05:02	OMFG what is going on Jesus Christ
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 03:07:12	JAHA why did taylor do that wth 😂 they probably are all mad at him now.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 03:07:55	Facing the fact that I will probably never meet them.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 03:08:06	Where is shawn?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 03:09:36	Taylor ya lil turd
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 04:26:54	What I'm wondering is who is making some of them leave
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:16:39	I'm not that sad, it's not like they died, they love us and we love them.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:18:31	Im really wondering if the bart rumors are true.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:19:31	Guys let's not jump to conclusions, we don't know for sure if it's bart or not.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:20:47	They always talked about how it was just the start and they planned on taking magcon far.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:21:31	Anyone who got to see the New Jersey magcon was blessed. They got to see the last 12/12 show
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 05:23:44	I'm gunna go to sleep, love you all- we are a family, don't forget that. 💕
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 18:57:43	I feel like they are just trying to make magcon Atlanta seem good even tho no one will want to go cuz half them won't be there.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 19:52:01	I just heard someone use "gay" as an insult.

It's freaking 2014
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-18 20:40:59	@surfdallas it's not over but all the members won't be there anymore

1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-21 22:08:38	The sunny weather makes me 😄👍
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-21 22:14:29	So your cousins cousin from a different family isn't actually your cousin then right?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-21 22:17:28	@hellnahitsdes hahah but it's not actually your cousin right?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-21 22:49:05	@polaroidmendes I'm reborn everytime I hear him sing. It clears my soul
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-21 23:05:16	@caniffsplayboy omg that's adorable 😂
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-21 23:53:02	I hate boring texters that just reply with "yeah" or "lol"

😑
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-21 23:58:06	It feels good actually getting rts and favs.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-21 23:59:23	I hate it when I post something that I think is going to be really funny and get a lot of rts/favs and then it gets nothing so I delete it 😒
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-22 00:04:35	The black tank top with the flowers or whatever on it that cam wears reminds me of women's apparel.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 04:25:09	I need to stop being so nice
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 04:43:36	@macaroni_mendes call 9 1 fucking 1
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 17:21:31	Going to see divergent. Is it good?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 17:39:05	The beef between bart and the boys tho
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 17:59:21	Definitely here for my boys over anyone else.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 18:06:13	I guess bart was always just in it for the money.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 18:06:59	Aaron is probably in a tough situation cuz Bart's a family friend but he has his best friends too.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 21:32:33	OK DIVERGENT WAS AMAZING
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 21:54:22	Theo James tho 😍 damnnnn
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 22:00:28	Nashhhhhhh spammmmmm erewhereeeee
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 22:01:46	Ok my whole entire timeline is nash spam like literally nothing else.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 22:02:42	I'm not going to even try to spam nash, it's not going to happen.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 22:04:07	Can we please have another #magconfollowparty #magcultfollowparty ?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 22:04:25	@jujualdada @Nashgrier right like it would just be a waste of ma time
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 22:05:29	@jujualdada @Nashgrier ya that would be nice
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 22:14:13	The whole Obey company is just subliminally feeding us the idea of conformity. People think it's sarcastic but if we see it enough it's not.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 22:16:05	@niallnadrienne @cuddlesmuke it's just like being famous for singing or acting
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 22:36:01	@niallnadrienne @cuddlesmuke that doesn't really make sense cuz editors and directors are famous from video making
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-20 01:59:57	The power just went off what
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-20 02:46:15	I'm pretty sure cam was just subtweeting aaron.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-20 03:02:41	@JacobWhitesides Wow bart wow.

1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-19 04:48:22	@idkCash pretty sure he's a sophomore.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-22 19:13:19	All we have been talking about for the past 2 weeks in health is sex.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-20 21:32:30	Easter is like my favorite holiday.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-22 21:36:29	My head hurts like a mother freaker.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-22 23:39:51	@Mr_Carterr what's going on I don't even see anything.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-22 23:41:47	What is Deborah's twitter?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-22 23:42:50	@annien826 thankd
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-22 23:49:51	It just shows how pathetic you are if you send Deborah or Carter hate.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-22 23:50:28	@jackjohns0ns I can do that face like perfectly and so when I meet him in June I'm gunna get a picture like that😂
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-23 00:16:05	Why does tomorrow have to be Wednesday? Definitely the worst day of the week besides Monday.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-23 00:18:25	When did taylor change outfits?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-23 00:19:42	@mattsbuttt @cozydxllas that's actually really true
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-23 00:32:27	@Mr_Carterr WHAT MISTAKE
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-23 00:32:54	Carter is saying that he made a mistake by doing vine and getting famous? Uhhhh?
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-23 00:33:28	@Tomlinsoogay literally me
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-23 00:34:00	Carter is sad more than he is happy 😩
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-23 00:36:01	People are judging carter but he should really learn to get used to it and not listen to it. He knows what is true and thats all thatmatters
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-23 00:36:41	@bangcxniff that is a pretty big insult to her therefore you are hating on her-someone you don't know.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-23 00:37:37	@joydivsions that's freaking adorable ahhhh
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-23 00:40:36	Honestly carter needs be realize what he has and realize what he is doing and see that what other people say doesn't matter at all.
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-23 01:54:44	@johnsonhyfr you'd get an STD and die
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-23 01:56:54	How is taylor still going to magcon wat
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-23 03:01:47	I'm going to cosmetology school when I get out of high school so really I don't need good grades I just need to pass. Idc
1711522867	livelyjai	2014-04-23 03:18:35	@banginqmendes thanks sunshine

1711522867	livelyjai	2015-03-19 02:48:31	Don't say "I want some cuddles" you make yourself sound like a wimpy ass.

1711522867	livelyjai	2015-03-19 20:54:38	The teacher always seems to call on me when I'm paying the least amount of attention
1711522867	livelyjai	2015-03-19 21:05:26	@Jaispiercing69 @xalexismarie why are you judging her about her picture? She's confident, that should be celebrated, not criticized.
1711522867	livelyjai	2015-03-19 21:08:53	It's funny how Luke has such a big butt but Jai doesn't
1711522867	livelyjai	2015-03-19 21:10:16	@xalexismarie yeah I think it's just cuz she's jealous 😘
1711522867	livelyjai	2015-03-19 21:12:33	@xalexismarie that's probably exactly it haha. Like she has to be 12 to hate on someone for showing their cleavage. Like why does she care
1711522867	livelyjai	2015-03-19 21:14:43	@xalexismarie yes we will! Never change, youre perf!
1711522867	livelyjai	2015-03-19 21:29:45	People always gotta put others down
