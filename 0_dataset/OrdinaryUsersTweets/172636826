172636826	JHamer_	2013-08-29 00:57:39	BO is unacceptable.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-08-29 01:00:25	How can you have friends that tolerate the stench you produce? Good-ness.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-08-29 01:05:41	Whoever plans these events needs to work on being on time?
172636826	JHamer_	2013-08-29 01:16:09	Good thing that I didn't have to pay for this.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-08-29 01:20:23	After 20 mins of waiting, I'm just unamused at this point.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-08-29 02:29:10	Elderly who come back to school are inspiring.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-08-29 02:39:45	I knew we're all in college, but there is a limit to what you should come outside looking like.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-08-29 04:17:19	Twitter, the new update is not all that great. Fix it.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-08-29 04:19:46	I have to get better at masking my facial expressions, because whatever I'm thinking is all over my face.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-08-30 15:17:01	@ArcadeFiasco YOU FEEL MY PAIN!
172636826	JHamer_	2013-08-30 15:19:10	Teachers won't even talk to you until class starts. lol

172636826	JHamer_	2013-09-05 21:31:56	Man, I'm annoyed by this computer already. It may be getting shipped back. The thing I wanted to avoid.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-09-05 21:52:57	FYI: You are responsible for what comes out of your mouth.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-09-18 20:54:28	@BallnwithJordan that's what I think, but so many people stay like its a game of who can cheat the most.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-09-19 03:05:11	I'm so annoyed with my teacher right now. I really thought that I was about to go to sleep and check online and there's an assignment.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-09-19 03:18:34	My family really tries to spare my feelings by not giving me information. I don't know why.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-09-19 03:19:44	For this assignment I have to watch 6 10-min videos. Jesus, help me.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-09-19 03:22:54	This wouldn't be a problem if I didn't want to sleep right now

172636826	JHamer_	2013-09-19 04:26:13	@Manae5 nothing besides a headache. She's supposedly going home tonight. I was more concerned about her health than the accident.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-09-19 04:35:55	Who vacuums at 11:30 at night? I'm highly annoyed.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-09-19 04:53:02	If I can get a enough hours of sleep to get me through my two classes tomorrow, I'll be fine.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-01 05:04:05	I'm just concerned about the people who have to work without pay. There is no incentive to show up, so why would they.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-01 05:05:37	One has to be a very dedicated American to work without pay.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-13 06:01:15	My brothers played me yo.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-16 13:55:34	Thank God.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-16 03:10:59	I don't even know how to dress for the weather anymore. Mother Nature is at a crossroads.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-16 03:45:13	Missed RHOH &amp; Hip Hop Awards thanks to MTSU cable.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-16 19:42:10	@beautybaby44 do you have any dinner plans for Nov. 9 while you're in TN? I know a great place.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-17 02:22:54	I literally have nothing to do right now, besides sleep.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-18 00:01:15	People will do you wrong and then won't even admit it. Thanks God that He is who He is.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-17 12:52:17	I'd rather be in bed.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-15 02:47:33	@AlexB_More flaked on me again.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-17 17:02:28	I need food and sleep.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-18 16:18:01	@Manae5 glad to hear that. What else you got going on?
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-18 16:26:07	@Manae5 that's true. I bet he's loving it.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-18 23:18:16	I'm trying to convince myself that I eat healthy. Panda Express is better than Popeyes right?
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-18 23:20:39	@D_LOVE_1 then I shall enjoy this meal guilt-free.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-18 23:23:54	@D_LOVE_1 I better not be. I already don't exercise. The least I can do is eat only three times a day.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-18 23:29:45	@D_LOVE_1 lol. Those flex bucks deplete fast!!
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-18 23:32:29	@D_LOVE_1 yeah I see. I'm trying to limit myself to 2 outside meals a week. I'll do better next year.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-20 01:43:14	Got a chicken sandwich instead of a burger. üëç I'm doing good.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-21 14:59:12	MTSU students are serious about.getting to class. Rollerblades, skateboards, scooters. You name it, they have it.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-23 00:50:35	Scorch turned this woman to ashes. Poor woman. #AgentsofSHIELD
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-21 15:00:42	I know we are students, but we are also adults and adults don't ride scooters.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-21 17:25:20	These people are always packing up on this professor.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-23 04:45:19	What's good with life, @ibellapeschardt?
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-23 04:46:56	I see she didn't tweet back. This is a math problem you don't want to solve. @_LoveIsBeautyy
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-23 04:49:23	@_LoveIsBeautyy üö∂üí®  I'm swift.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-23 04:52:26	Please don't take me serious. It's been a long day &amp; it's all in good fun.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-22 12:48:00	I can't imagine what it's going to feel like in December. Luckily, I'll be home for most of it.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-22 03:34:19	I need Mr. West to be knocked from his high horse. As brilliant an artist you are...Sir, you are not a God.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-22 03:35:39	Why does MTSU not have VH1 though?
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-26 03:26:01	I need to lay off this food. Like, I have a real problem.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-27 03:23:49	@_LoveIsBeautyy lol. Jordan tried to play you. @So_exJORDANary
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-27 03:27:32	@_LoveIsBeautyy she? You just tried to play him. The movie was good. It was more funny than scary.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-27 03:31:32	@ArcadeFiasco I didn't even know it was her when I watched the movie.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-27 03:32:01	@_LoveIsBeautyy I have to tell you about the experience via text.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-27 03:42:37	It's like 7 weeks until Christmas break. üëçüëçüëç I'll be done with my classes and get to go home for a month.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-27 03:51:24	A man was charged with assault with a deadly weapon after 3 people were injured on an amusement ride that he was operating.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-24 01:13:58	People are mad rude. Thank God I know  Jesus.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-27 05:21:58	HSN will put you to sleep. I wasn't even watching it and I'm yawning. Just listening to it is enough.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-24 16:02:48	Just posted a photo http://t.co/BI1naro0mU
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-28 02:46:31	Do people really think that it's not considered cheating as long as you tell the other person?
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-24 19:28:47	Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, or Physical Science. I have no idea which science to take.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-28 00:57:32	Siri brought me to a Mcdonalds in a Walmart. -_-
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-28 02:16:11	I'm exhausted.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-25 03:10:20	I'm glad that Sandy Hook is being torn down. Those kids shouldn't have to relive that experience everyday.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-28 17:24:16	Done with classes. Now it's time to go change into what I really wanted to wear to class: tshirt &amp; pajamas.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-28 17:38:15	@ArcadeFiasco did he not learn to keep his hands to himself. Just mad for no reason.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-28 17:47:28	I could devour some Popeyes right now, but I won't.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-29 04:06:47	The word "nigga" is derogatory. Not appropriate for use by any race. Have some respect.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-29 04:08:15	But this is America where freedom of speech gives people the right to say whatever they want.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-29 04:08:51	Just because it's legal doesn't make it safe.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-29 04:13:31	My insides want to explode when PowerPoints are read verbatim.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-28 13:53:52	Sometimes it's better to listen than talk.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-28 13:54:49	I believe in a moment of silence. It's rare once I leave my dorm.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-29 13:00:48	Iyanla just fixed my life. lol
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-29 13:01:57	There's only 10 people in class right now. #HoustonWeHaveAProblem
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-29 13:21:14	I'm mostly upset about my time being wasted. I don't do that.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-25 20:41:51	Why is this girl always here? Like, don't you have a home.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-29 19:36:53	Gotta Get It - Juvenile.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-28 19:41:32	Why do people talk extremely loud on the phone? Like, the receiver is holding the phone directly to their ear. No need to yell.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-28 21:45:18	Man. Life does not stop.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-28 23:42:58	We need to set some rules on this hall! You don't take someone's clothes from the dryer unless they've finished.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-10-30 22:54:55	Waiting to find out how my roommate is going to justify leaving someone in this room while he goes to class.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-03 19:51:50	So BET didn't keep any of those 106 hosts from earlier this year?
172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-01 14:04:09	Kimmel must not have the smartest ppl on his team. How can you continue to do hurtful skits and then apologize for them? Man up or Shut up.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-01 14:40:26	Today should've been cancelled.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-01 03:00:31	These #Scandal cliff hangers are insane.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-01 03:16:49	Conrad Murray is looking rough. Pray for that soul. Rain falls the just as well as the unjust.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-03 20:48:23	"Help me on my journey. Help me on my way. Lord, I want you to help me."
172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-01 14:07:53	@ArcadeFiasco that's true, but he shouldn't feel the need to apologize every time. He obviously does it for comedic purposes.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-01 14:12:28	@ArcadeFiasco yeah. It's all entertainment though.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-01 15:20:28	When people say: "I hate people." Uh, did you forget that you were a person.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-01 16:14:48	Swear I'm Kanye West today. lol jk

172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-05 00:13:00	This woman just assumed that I wanted to use my flex bucks. I already don't have much. She just played me.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-08 03:12:28	College professors know that they can waste your time. At least collect the assignment if you're not going to grade it.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-08 18:32:20	When did they start giving campus tours to middle schoolers?

172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-11 02:22:56	I need a hazmat suit to live on this hall.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-11 02:58:23	My computer dies so fast. Screw you Dell.

172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-11 14:30:28	I just overheard a girl say that she was too grown to leave a voicemail. -_-
172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-09 04:27:08	"Martin" will forever be funny.
172636826	JHamer_	2013-11-09 04:27:16	Timeless comedy.

172636826	JHamer_	2014-08-20 06:33:20	@IAmMiss_Ashley I'm pissed every time I turn on the Tv. It's sad to think that people are this cruel.
