17902473	Xibee	2015-02-05 14:26:04	@john_in_siam Thanks, very interesting! Not something to hassle with every day, obviously. Packaging is an interesting point, what is best?
17902473	Xibee	2015-02-05 14:28:17	@john_in_siam (I fear a lot of my teas are getting pretty old.) i have most in tins, some in aluminum coated bags, some came in plastic bags
17902473	Xibee	2015-02-05 14:29:25	@john_in_siam and i keep some in ceramics. Now you have me curious as to what packaging's effect is!
17902473	Xibee	2015-02-05 14:31:06	@john_in_siam Also curious about star anise since my only experience with it is in Chinese cooking, &amp; a little seems to go a long way.
17902473	Xibee	2015-02-05 15:35:54	@tomandlorenzo Crazy? What's crazy about this?
17902473	Xibee	2015-02-05 15:39:26	@Lindakirkbride1 Omg that's a gorgeous color. I usually hate brown; this however is rich and interesting!
17902473	Xibee	2015-02-05 15:51:09	@Lindakirkbride1 What did you dye with? You weren't expecting brown?
17902473	Xibee	2015-02-05 15:55:33	@AskAuntieEm1 he's a lawyer?? Or worse?
17902473	Xibee	2015-02-05 16:02:53	@john_in_siam aluminum isn't good?? Does it change it? I'm surprised by that
17902473	Xibee	2015-02-05 16:11:07	@john_in_siam EEeek, a couple of months? I'm in oldness.
17902473	Xibee	2015-02-06 00:55:04	@AskAuntieEm1 oh that's better. But explaining away the "drunk&amp;disorderly while changing tire in a yellow tutu" fine is always a challenge..

17902473	Xibee	2015-02-06 01:39:58	@tweetingWien ummmmm. Hm. Perhaps likely. I have very mixed feelings. Nothing to do with autism.
17902473	Xibee	2015-02-06 01:42:31	@ole_grandpa No. But it's an iPhone. 
However there are times when people tweet me and I can't see previous tweet, which is annoying.
17902473	Xibee	2015-02-06 01:42:55	@ole_grandpa (that may be from phone vs computer?)
17902473	Xibee	2015-02-06 01:49:55	@ole_grandpa Me personally, I vote iPhone hands down. Never have any trouble with it. Wish battery life were better, but That's common.
17902473	Xibee	2015-02-06 01:51:24	@ole_grandpa If u did go with an iPhone, a word of advice: pick the one with most storage space/brains always. Saves grief later.

17902473	Xibee	2015-02-06 21:04:57	@looseheadprop12 @JohnShortcut @IGN It's the different angles of head versus shoulders that don't work, good catch.

17902473	Xibee	2015-03-09 07:38:23	@Akelaa you have to wait till she's doing something right accidentally and reward for it.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-09 07:39:58	@Akelaa &amp; treats don't have to be expensive, just cook some chicken well, chop it in bits, freeze them.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-09 07:46:33	@Akelaa Alas. You need to find another place for it then. They know when they're disliked. And they laugh.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-09 07:50:32	@Akelaa still means you shouldn't have a cat.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-09 07:55:06	@Akelaa I don't mean tricks. I mean, that's how you train any animal to behave well. When they do what you want, reward.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-09 07:59:33	@Akelaa what I would do is: she gets on table. You pick her up &amp; put her on floor. Say NO. She gets up again, repeat. &amp; repeat.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-09 08:00:02	@Akelaa She'll get tired finally. When she stays down for a minute on floor, treat.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-09 08:02:46	@Akelaa Well, I'd have to be there to see the steps in the whole situation, but it can be done.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-10 17:12:05	@Frocktalk mute it, turn the camera on yourself, turn around &amp; take it over your shoulder but look like you're doing selfie.

Is it pronounced as it looks in English?
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-18 15:01:34	@RippleCreekNW Agree semicolon use has been beaten out of us; but surprisingly the TV "sound-bite" mentality was not addressed as cause.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-18 15:03:55	@RippleCreekNW I find it still used very properly in legal work: it assures that a lawyer can prove 2 ideas were mentioned in 1 sentence.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-18 15:07:42	@RippleCreekNW Also: I don't think many people even think in connective clauses anymore. Too impatient.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-18 15:07:59	@RippleCreekNW  (Like those 2 sentences which might have been joined; a partial sentence being more powerful.)
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-18 15:08:29	@RippleCreekNW interesting article though!

17902473	Xibee	2015-03-18 16:00:58	@RippleCreekNW Mine have been making concerted efforts in that regard for years - England is still a holdout, though.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-18 16:02:51	@RippleCreekNW Most legalese is a thoughtfully chosen tool - they engineer it. When it backfires, they change.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-18 16:04:35	@RippleCreekNW I actually had a lawyer wigh quote on his wall: "If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bullshit."

17902473	Xibee	2015-03-27 20:14:17	@joulles1 @ShemGordon Don't understand --why is that funny?
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-28 19:46:22	@2nerdyhistgirls @NTSCollections @N_T_S Also interesting because I can't find examples of embroidered aprons in art from that timeframe.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-28 19:47:13	@2nerdyhistgirls @NTSCollections @N_T_S  So I thought, perhaps a frontpiece for a little girl's dress?
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-28 20:26:55	@TechCrunch @thegadget_geek so wrong

17902473	Xibee	2015-03-28 21:22:16	@JaySchryer I wish I could have afforded it. But I'm not up to building two costumes lately, too much going on...

I'm too exhausted for that.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-29 16:09:22	Of course I try not to insult anyone. Unless I'm feeling moved by karma.

17902473	Xibee	2015-03-29 17:19:03	The part we need to address in #techculture - that fitting into a clique mentality for/of tech men should not be the evaluation for women.

17902473	Xibee	2015-03-29 16:16:55	@JohnnyGWeir He's confused gayness w outrageous art spirit (OAE). Straights have to learn that THAT comes in EVERY sexual preference.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-29 17:05:16	@Thunmont I figured it was a quick dash-off -- i know your levels : )
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-29 17:22:11	@Thunmont I get snotty once in a while and some of my followers call me on it.  I figure I'm sometimes lazy in it, sometimes adamant.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-29 17:23:03	@Thunmont ...and you'd be surprised how many "art-lovers" are such goody two shoes.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-29 20:20:02	Most annoying tweeters (4 me):

1) business jargon-laden pitches
2) High schoolers writing ignorant click-bait

Where is this? Gorgeous!
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-30 17:47:50	@JaJasTweets I have been looking everywhere for legit, simple, unadulterated essence of purple lilac. Can't find anything non-adding!
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-30 17:48:20	@JaJasTweets Also: why? Where have all the providers gone?
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-30 17:49:11	@JaJasTweets Have already tried Highland Lilac. Close, but no cigar.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-30 17:51:51	@Britanniacomms Where is this?
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-30 17:57:26	@JaJasTweets Unfortunately I am just an individual, not a business- would love to learn extraction process for myself tho!
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-30 17:58:50	@JaJasTweets I am even having trouble finding lilacs, but do have access to about three bushes. ::sigh::
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-30 17:59:26	@JaJasTweets Where would I learn essence making?
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-30 18:13:28	@JaJasTweets AWESOME! Thanks. It was the term enfleurage I'd needed. If you ever find a source for lilac let me know! Meantime, I'll dabble.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-30 03:48:52	@Thunmont Oh!! Lol i hadn't read any ither posts on it -- I thought you were mentioning Allegra the drug.... Very confuzzled of course

17902473	Xibee	2015-04-01 14:11:51	@treefroggirl Glad you're doing well!
17902473	Xibee	2015-04-01 14:12:51	@ole_grandpa Seriously? Do you mean a snowblower? Do you have to go out and clean?

17902473	Xibee	2015-03-31 22:07:20	I just listened to Marvin Gaye's tune and Blurred Lines (yes I'm past schedule) out of curiosity.  So not right!
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-31 22:07:57	Geez, if Gaye's family can sue for "feel", which is all this has in common with Marvin's tune, you could sue fricken half the music biz.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-31 22:09:18	I mean COME ON, you can't sue for a common GROOVE.  Jeez.  We all go with a groove when the style is on.  Look at Janet Jackson! So Princey
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-31 22:10:13	Honestly the music biz is just out of control rubbish these days.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-31 22:11:20	You also should never sue for a throw-back to a good beat from a past era, nor a quote from a famous player - assuming it's a quote, only.
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-31 22:12:56	@Slavojiek @NeinQuarterly By that you mean, attachment?
17902473	Xibee	2015-03-31 22:16:18	Oh, and P.S. Marvin Gaye's family:  Guess which song is most memorable and doesn't have to worry about staying-power?  Marvin's.

17902473	Xibee	2015-05-05 15:51:56	@RippleCreekNW  Did u have a favorite? I think all appropriateness aside, I like Karen Elson's Balenciaga.
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-05 16:12:05	@RippleCreekNW @ELLEmagazine If going with classic looks, I like Wendy Murdoch's blue. Or that river of silver on Sofie Turner. Wow.
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-05 16:14:09	@RippleCreekNW @NYTFashion I think Madonna and Solange are worst; but prime shockingly awful, Jessica's crazy headdress.

17902473	Xibee	2015-05-05 17:10:41	@RippleCreekNW I liked the guo pei cape but felt it was just too obscenely huge for a Gala. Rihanna i'm not crazy about anyway.
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-05 17:12:41	@RippleCreekNW i love mid-calf but only on Dovima in the 1950s or full Balenciaga ir Dior gowns. Takes VERY nice gams for that!
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-05 17:13:39	@RippleCreekNW &amp; the green shoes were fun!
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-05 17:16:14	@RippleCreekNW I liked the KimK dress. On someone more columnar perhaps. I'm just sick of seeing naked bodies in public, enough already.
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-05 17:18:37	@RippleCreekNW omg yes hideous...

17902473	Xibee	2015-05-07 07:01:02	@diskincluded or seriously fiberglass???
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-07 07:06:07	@diskincluded Fiberglass is really unsafe media to use unless you need a boat or skateboard device or something. Worbla is much safer&amp;clean

17902473	Xibee	2015-05-09 14:04:04	@RippleCreekNW nice. I'm wondering about that mint color though..
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-09 14:12:12	@RippleCreekNW are you a Fall? I'm a Summer. Ever get your colors done long ago?
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-09 14:13:29	@RippleCreekNW 40s are great but not all patterns flattered I think. I love some, hated others.

17902473	Xibee	2015-05-10 04:27:01	@RippleCreekNW Strangely I hate browns and beiges. My mom's colors, old and dusty to me&amp; of course not flattering for me

17902473	Xibee	2015-05-10 03:50:25	@RippleCreekNW There's only one blue that doesn't work - next to the darkest one.
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-10 03:51:52	@RippleCreekNW There should be a lot more greens - yellow green leaf, olive, etc, chartreuse

17902473	Xibee	2015-05-10 03:55:17	@RippleCreekNW Right I guessed-Lots of teal. Sad cause I'm a bit sick of it, but it's my best color. People actually tell me I look happier.

17902473	Xibee	2015-05-11 21:45:26	@RobertHalfLegal, this is 3RD TIME I hear nothing from my contact at your office, followed by a cold call from another new contact-USELESS!.
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-11 21:47:51	@RobertHalfLegal I have never been treated by any agency like this. This puts us in limbo. Follow up &amp; figure out how to keep yr employees!
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-11 22:43:09	@RobertHalfLegal the problem is not that they don't follow up EVENTUALLY (such as they did today). The problem is I've been sitting
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-11 22:44:33	@RobertHalfLegal for who knows how long from the time my last contact left you. There is no proper hand-off done when employees exit.
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-11 22:45:39	@RobertHalfLegal the day someone leaves, call all their prospects and tell them there's been a change.
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-11 22:46:39	@RobertHalfLegal and hopefully this won't continue to happen every two months, as it has been.
17902473	Xibee	2015-05-11 22:47:47	@RobertHalfLegal These young lawyers you're hiring as agents are bailing far too fast for anything good to come about.

17902473	Xibee	2015-06-09 06:04:34	@RippleCreekNW o no, it's just that it's a GIVEN for Helen to win. Love her. 
Now, what's this blue thing?
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-09 06:06:49	@RippleCreekNW i think i dislike everything but the non-ikat fabric. That's nice pattern. But they've destroyed it with the rest.
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-09 06:07:45	@RippleCreekNW (I'm more a purist than you I think) (black is fine, plain blue is fine....stop.)
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-09 06:36:05	Thank gawd @sense8 came along at this pointbin our dearthy television season. It's a delight.

17902473	Xibee	2015-06-09 22:15:35	@RippleCreekNW I had no idea.  I don't follow celebs unless they're nerds.
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-09 22:21:18	@RippleCreekNW  Interesting, but in hindsight she was so anti-Vietnam as to insult the whole cause-- not just proceeding from this photo.
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-09 22:22:26	@RippleCreekNW Of course we ALL were insulting toward the military back then because we believed these guys had a choice - they could dodge!
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-09 22:22:55	@RippleCreekNW (a big mistake on ALL our parts back then, we were all hopeless naive.)
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-09 22:28:59	@RippleCreekNW That's how sis felt.  But I saw hippies in the park in San Fran on TV &amp; said THIS IS THE LIFE FOR ME.  
I did end up there.
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-09 22:29:32	@RippleCreekNW I really made a lot of changes in my life, and that was just the first page.

17902473	Xibee	2015-06-10 05:05:52	@RippleCreekNW None of it is actual ikat. Ikat is making a pattern on woven surface, unweaving it and reweaving it to produce a shift.
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-10 05:06:31	@RippleCreekNW this is all just printed, and the two prints do nothing for each other.
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-10 05:08:01	@RippleCreekNW i think the fashion gods died out after Alexander McQueen passed.... Unless some new upstart can save us...
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-10 05:59:12	@MortuaryReport 8 (. Wish I could back u up on dogs.
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-10 06:02:34	@MortuaryReport ::hugs:: i get that. I do. I had a good friend who was post-polio paralytic and had terrible osteoporosis. I get it.::hugs::
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-10 23:41:50	Is this some kind of gang sign? In pajamas no less? http://t.co/8PkV8iF2BK
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-10 23:43:27	@RippleCreekNW they can be led to the stats -- those who truly are rulebreakers in arts are the ones who actually end up making money.

I am tolerant. But: Every time we let it sit out there for someone to read, we confuse someone else further.
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-10 16:29:03	@RippleCreekNW Well, iconoclasmic change is healthy, is the message...
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-10 16:29:52	@RippleCreekNW Iconoclastic? Iconoclasmic? It is kind of messy.
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-10 16:30:12	@badwebsites Indeed!!
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-12 00:29:28	@Thunmont SERiously. It was approached as if the elements of my resume were falsities and I was some Kafkaesque defendant
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-12 00:30:50	@RippleCreekNW Dragon? All i saw was pineapple

17902473	Xibee	2015-06-12 00:36:11	@RippleCreekNW ohhhhh the gecko thing. Ya no thanks.
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-12 00:43:53	@RippleCreekNW um well I think it's kinda dopey even for that
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-12 00:45:48	@RippleCreekNW unless maybe you ran a petshop or a lizardarium or something

17902473	Xibee	2015-06-11 22:29:53	@GuyKawasaki The only question is, HOW MUCH IS THIS GENIUS GETTING PAID?
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-13 01:11:09	Spot a one-color-jumpsuit looking head covered person in my parking lot.  My first thought:  HAZMAT SUITS? HERE??
Whew.  nope.

17902473	Xibee	2015-06-13 01:15:17	@VictorianLondon Yes indeed-Uncle never gave away any of the secrets of trade, but he did say that before the 1930s-40s, it was like that.
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-13 01:23:04	@blcsfo Aww, it's still there.  Oi Mai heaven

17902473	Xibee	2015-06-15 00:16:34	@DETAILS I think this a brilliant statement socially/artistically. But fashion, no, it's not fashion.
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-15 00:21:32	@ole_grandpa But I luuuuuurv it. It's sparkly kitch and it's fun!
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-15 00:22:00	@ole_grandpa (but you're right, whew.)
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-15 00:32:02	@ole_grandpa I would but this is so old the metal holding the crystals together is kind of rusty and delicate. I would love it if I could.

17902473	Xibee	2015-06-15 00:56:03	@ole_grandpa Hm. Well I'll consider. So how's the property? Did you get cabin renters?
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-15 01:02:43	@ole_grandpa Sounds like you need to charge reduced rent for a strong young person to live there and help fix it up
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-15 01:06:51	@ole_grandpa oh right! What phone did you get?
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-15 01:09:09	@ole_grandpa You advertise through church people out there I would guess
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-15 15:00:56	Have to say, am liking this FAR more than I expected. Well done, #Wachowskis! It goes where Cloud Atlas could not.

17902473	Xibee	2015-06-16 12:44:13	@Colossal @fngdesign I see nothing in this piece that speaks to the pearl trade, only a pretty object as lustworthy as any pearl jewelry.
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-16 13:00:48	Half of me says OOH pretty.
The other half worries that's where my temp wages went.

17902473	Xibee	2015-06-15 21:49:44	Chagrin. The word when you've spent almost all day procrastinating under the guise of dilligent repair-project shopping.

17902473	Xibee	2015-06-16 20:33:22	@NtlMuseumsScot @tartanroots Wish we had your programming here in Seattle!
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-16 20:34:35	@iamporgy @iDreamof_U Yes, if they're divorced. Then you'll get some good advice!
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-16 03:16:51	@ole_grandpa How much was this one?
17902473	Xibee	2015-06-16 03:18:45	@sketch_42 @Inventables Sounds complicated!
