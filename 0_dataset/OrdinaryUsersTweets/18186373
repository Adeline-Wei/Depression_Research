18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-21 13:49:39	@trakt &lt;3 Amazing. I shall do so right now.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-18 17:20:42	@MrLloydSpandex Though I imagine you could also get the actual fruit / cheaper pills from a little looking around :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-19 12:23:14	@Brainmage tangled up with fishing wire.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-19 10:36:41	@victohenry so abort the reset process and just go and log in? :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-19 11:18:02	@Thunderrage You have underestimated and just missed a critical vet appointment and now your cats are dead. GAME OVER. Continue?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-19 14:04:28	@Brainmage That's my 'safe word' - just in case either Laura or I get posessed by Sam.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-19 14:16:32	@angri_la train the cats.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-19 16:18:22	@jonanamary My go-to phrase is something like "You are a terrible human being and should be ashamed about everything you do here."
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-19 21:51:56	@Wangleberry that makes about 4 in total so far :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-19 20:59:57	Superheroes that wear *trousers* while in action (not leggings/tights) - here's one to start you off: Blade. Any others?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-19 21:20:51	@zoeaustin yes. Also I had Gambit (sometimes).
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-19 21:22:39	@zoeaustin he is the embodiment of inaction.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-19 21:24:33	@zoeaustin I got a grudging "yeah" for characters from The Matrix, though tbh that might not be trousers, also questionable on superheroes.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-20 07:20:36	@FloxxieWalker I think Indy is just a regular hero :/ Cool, yes. Super? Not quite.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-20 07:22:37	@zoeaustin not sure on Fury actually since I don't know much about him. Is he really super beyond being stubborn and coping with disability?

18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-20 15:26:03	Having an in depth discussion with minions on the different sorts of false you can have in programming.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-21 11:18:51	@MrLloydSpandex it's always 9pm somewhere. #loopholes
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-22 10:15:44	@Brainmage sounds like my cat.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-22 13:12:30	@daniel_barker Vodka/Red Bull? ;P
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-22 13:14:20	@daniel_barker Rummy Bears.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-24 18:11:23	Um... This is not a good thing. http://t.co/NvTXuX9yv1 ingredients are basically sugar, blue, and poison.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-24 18:20:39	@Vigour @angri_la thinks it will go well on ice cream. I'm not sure myself. And you're (both) very welcome. :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-21 12:28:47	@trakt Do you release inactive usernames? I was about to register and wanted to use "matryx" but it's taken by a 2011 with nothing watched.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-26 09:12:55	I can't walk, stand, or sit anymore. RT: @angri_la: WHOAH BODYPU-UMP, BODYPU-UMP FOR YOU! #smugexercisetweet #bodypump
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-26 09:23:02	Getting an itch to play some Split/Second again.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-25 11:40:57	@Brainmage Awesome. Where can I get one?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-25 16:10:21	@AstuteCatte Hey Wheeeeeeel - cheers for the music rec. kthxbye #jobdone.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-25 16:10:59	@AstuteCatte but yeah, I get a bit "um, ok then" when people message me with "Oh I was just listening to BEB and thought of you. Thanks!"
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-25 16:14:47	@AstuteCatte but on the other hand, the last time I thanked someone for music recs they then linked me to 80s b line matchbox disaster :D
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-25 16:23:18	@AstuteCatte I remember someone@uni said that just before she decided the best way to break ice was to bite the person she needed to talk to
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-25 16:23:32	@AstuteCatte So, you know, good job on not doing that... yet.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-27 15:06:25	@Vigour It's just working out how best to get in and slaughter you all.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-27 16:14:52	@Brainmage something something bodyform something wings.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-28 08:23:11	I googled for Iron Bat - hoping to find some decorative forged items blacksmithing style etc.... The internet just supplied ironman/batman.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-28 11:16:27	Going to make tiny metal shoes for the cats. #blacksmithing
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-27 08:24:34	@rocket_panda So they stop using the tape? rather than stopping using just the USPS or pursuing it in other fashions.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-30 15:26:13	GothyCoffee! Dark (like your soul) or Pale (like the moonlight). Also comes in Deep (giant mugs) and FrothyGothyCoffee variants.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-27 15:54:48	@Vigour hah. Maurelicus
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-28 14:51:46	@daniel_barker what about words like "tear" as in to rip up, and "tear" as in crying. Trying to keep all the pronunciations for themselves.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-28 17:10:08	@you_twits Just cook it to an IV.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-02 08:26:00	@Trynottobreathe I hope you were eating the banana like owls eat rodents.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-02 12:02:28	@daniel_barker I've had a supernatural experience myself. Perhaps one of the only legit ones. I watched an episode just over lunch. #tvshow
18186373	dmatryx	2013-03-28 19:34:00	. @angri_la sniffing herself "It's so weird my dressing gown smelling clean."
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-04 10:48:43	@angri_la It's the SNOW RESPONSE TEAM.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-05 13:59:12	@Duds_2k best idea.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-05 13:59:48	@CitymapperLON ME! OMG ME!
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-05 14:00:03	@CitymapperLON So envious of fiancee with her iOS thing and me being stuck without it on my droid.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-03 07:36:21	Dark and Intense #gothycoffee
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-03 07:45:20	@n0rm You'd be surprised. We get invoices refused because someone's email address was supposedly wrong (it wasn't, they changed it)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-03 07:45:51	@n0rm best one was that when they printed it, it came out wrong. so they refused it. #nothingtodowithus
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-03 07:46:48	@n0rm I know - it's terrible.  We have a standard invoice now we send out and just have another company chase payments not made.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-03 07:47:18	@n0rm After all, it's our bloody invoice.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-03 11:40:10	@MrDanHillier Ah, thanks for checking for me. Are you going to be at The Other Art Fair in April?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-04 13:33:31	@Vigour GIMME! *nom*
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-03 14:38:56	Package 1 of 2 has arrived for me at home. I ordered a single item, so I'm really wondering if a second item will arrive and what it is! O_o
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-03 15:41:52	@thunderrage telling me about a royal roast with 5 birds stuffed in each other and a sausage too. So I linked him to http://t.co/hKNclYtae1
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-03 21:11:14	I just declared the latest Jonathan Creek as the worst one yet, then @angri_la pointed out that it didn't have Caroline Quentin in. Touché
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-03 21:12:32	Mystery wise though it wad pretty terrible. Another one you had no chance to work out. Also surprise WTF at the end.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-03 21:14:20	@evilmanic mmm. I can actually recommend the specials (sheridan smith) as not being terrible. Just find CQs character unbearable.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-03 21:14:49	Hmm. Wad/was typo. Preserved forever.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-03 21:19:14	@evilmanic you should watch them. I think Devil's Chimney is my favourite mystery, though may be misremembering the name.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-05 10:04:41	Reading up on Levenshtein distances.  Reminds me of that game show Chain Letters
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-05 13:05:52	Someone thought it wise to steal our entire website (spidered) and leech images/css from us.  I have "improved" their website for them.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-05 13:48:18	@Duds_2k I just blocked everything.  I did joke with other techs about goatse though.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-05 13:48:31	@Duds_2k their site is more streamlined now.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-05 15:52:32	@FrogCroakley http://t.co/1HOyNHMUen There is no regret. #close
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-09 14:14:03	@unfortunatalie Sounds pretty normal to me. Top tip : Don't reply with something like "If it were nicely styled already we'd be done by now"
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-09 14:17:25	@MrLloydSpandex Some wear them to help protect what sight they have, some to make people who can see more comfortable.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-09 14:18:24	@MrLloydSpandex The Sun drawn with teeth / sunglasses is just stupid though. It's not happy / friendly. It will burn you until you are gone.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-12 09:18:04	@unfortunatalie See if you can turn it into a business acronym or something. Then repeat with other words.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-12 13:54:44	The office asked me for some music suggestions and now they're all feeling depressed listening to my gothy crap :D
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-11 09:28:06	Making risotto tonight. Because I can't be bothered to buy some white wine for it I'll just be substituting strongbow. Totally gonna work.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-11 13:07:43	@mangmangmang Sometimes I wish I could auto-block tweets matching certain phrases to just stop filler tweets e.g "X is my new jam"
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-11 13:08:07	@mangmangmang or whatever the current topic of the day is that I don't care about / etc.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-11 13:08:46	@mangmangmang I'd rather people posted links to soundcloud tracks / youtube videos by hand because at least then I know it's not automatic
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-16 07:32:06	CC @victohenry RT: @AlicksDobbs: I fear twitter may love this http://t.co/JNErw2Jzyd
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-16 09:47:25	@victohenry Equally annoyingly, there's no legislation stopping cars from using them.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-16 09:50:39	@victohenry Last I heard as a police point, it doesn't count as running a red light unless they pass the actual far line. Advance stop lines
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-16 09:50:59	@victohenry basically mean nothing, unless the officer is there to watch the motorist deliberately drive in once the light is already red.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-16 09:51:52	@victohenry According to that article it *is* illegal, just the police need properly educating, as usual.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-16 13:18:04	@Brainmage Are you going to buy a statue of yourself? Or maybe just a brain-gun which spouts terrible things.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-16 13:19:11	@Brainmage Gay-4-Marblez is a goon btw and has been posting in the thread. There's a steamgifts giveaway for codes if you are mega-poor.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-16 13:21:25	@Brainmage Yeah, I pre-ordered as soon as I saw the link. Can't wait.  Stretch goal race of gasbag cowboys with ADD is tempting me sorely.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-16 13:22:53	@severalbees also "Toothache".
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-16 13:34:12	@Brainmage Come to Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese about 1pm and sure.  I already have a lunch "meeting" then. I'll likely be in the gloomy depths.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-16 13:36:03	@xerode @dwylth @Brainmage Not technically, but yes in all ways that it counts.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-16 14:20:07	Christ - we're approaching 10 years of Badger Badger.  September 2003 that was. #old
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 07:03:17	The processing is going to go right past my office window. I'd joke about throwing things at it but the police would probably over-react.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 07:04:40	@n0rm Ah, but PA1 is biometrically signed. The vast password is just a password :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 07:07:23	@hobofood What's a homeopathic version of bad feelings. Just glaring out the window?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 07:12:53	@hobofood sounds like most evenings :D
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 07:21:46	@Wangleberry I had to walk from Southwark to Fleet Street. It's a bit, well, pick your futurist opressive regime to taste.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 07:22:02	@Wangleberry But this one comes with creepy white gloves.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 07:23:02	@jonanamary Virtually everything I own is black. Only red things nearby are office chairs, still I could shove those out the window.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 07:32:16	@n0rm Wasn't that just that Data locked out everyone else's command codes separately or something?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 08:24:57	If ever there was a day for the weather to suddenly decide to throw us a blizzard, today would be it.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 08:45:37	@Brainmage They go on cottages as insulation.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 09:13:24	We've been told to stay away from the windows because of police snipers
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 09:41:48	Oh god I really want to spend &gt;$10k on a table for board-gaming. http://t.co/7CjLUhpWS3
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 09:53:07	@angri_la At the moment I don't know if they deliver to the UK.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 09:55:44	@angri_la Can get it "proper gamer" size. 8' x 5'  (or 6'2 x 4'2 for the small option)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 09:58:14	@angri_la You don't know how tempted I am! I'm going to email them and enquire about UK purchases. If they have a UK partner or just ship...
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 11:05:05	@n0rm Funny, I was going to post this : http://t.co/CmX1WoVoFf
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 13:14:40	@NotRollergirl I believe this is to do with re-verifying your account for spam access. Log out-&gt;in on your comp,it may prompt you to verify.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-17 13:15:28	@NotRollergirl You may have to go to the gmail web version from the ipad even to do it there. Don't have an ipad so basing off 2nd hand info
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-18 07:48:16	@Brainmage Awww, did you find your way back to yourself?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-18 15:04:18	@zoeaustin awwww, for keeps? or just sitting?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-20 10:18:06	Peckham Rye is all full of life and bustle. Ugh
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-20 10:18:47	Also football. Lots of football
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-19 12:41:20	@akaikitsunechan Ah, mine is the opposite. Check. Shock, transfer from savings.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-23 07:27:52	@Brainmage How can you tweet and drink at the same time. You're not drinking correctly, or enough.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-23 10:50:00	@skylanders_fans I've just entered a raffle to win a Molten Hot Dog figure at http://t.co/TJKjDyLYSl #skylanders #giveaway
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-23 10:54:07	@Skylanders_Fans Not fair that the ones we always want are so long away.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-23 11:20:45	@CitymapperLON when I'm walking, and the start point is "My Location" - I would really like to be able to "update route" to replan from here
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-23 11:21:53	@CitymapperLON e.g. In cases where I've had to go elsewhere because of road works, or have just not paid attention to the map.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-23 11:25:15	@CitymapperLON Would also be really good to be able to save a couple of favourite destinations with labels. I go to friend's houses a lot.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-23 12:29:33	@Skylanders_Fans Cheaper to figure out how to make your own I think in this case.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-23 12:56:31	So, as of today, I've been in this job for 10 years.  O_O
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-23 13:22:18	@Brainmage @EwaSR Looking forwards to the years and years of inbreeding... How long till superpowers mutate approx?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-24 06:43:40	@CitymapperLON I have recent searches available but no way I can see to favourite or rename them. On android btw.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-24 06:45:29	@CitymapperLON OH! Also, any chance you guys can hook into google latitude so I can set a person as a destination? Good for general meetups
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-24 13:10:07	@undeadlabs Can I go through the closer cabin to get to the ranger station?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-24 15:02:39	@CitymapperLON Eagerly awaiting then :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-24 15:25:46	@BugsMcgee I *so* need to do this sometime. Of course I don't actually want kids on my lawn first. #conflicted
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-25 07:30:39	@white_mischief Oooo... that would be horrible. If people could enter reasons when unfollowing.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-25 08:21:48	@white_mischief No-one believes the stories about the builders. Stop fibbing or I'm telling Ma!
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-25 18:42:47	Hmm, I'm fatter on one side.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-26 12:24:03	Shipsters. Obscure breed of bearded boat with plaid sails &amp; really thick framed telescope. Can be heard mumbling "YoHo" and "Ahoy" to itself
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-28 12:56:28	I bought an art! (Also a rucksack full of Sipsmith's Slow Gin).
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-28 13:37:47	My art is really big too.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-29 09:33:13	So I said I bought an art. Here it is. Giant metal sculpture "Urban Cocoon" by Frédéric Daty. #art http://t.co/GihEJY35Mb
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-29 09:34:50	@SockToi See my latest tweet :D (or here http://t.co/hHvURp1gvO )
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-29 10:02:08	@myboxoftricks Pfft. I am the focus of it obv.  ( I need to get some bits to mount it on the wall )
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-29 12:39:51	Also bought some excellent illustrations from @Damilolaa at The Other Art Fair. Check out his work here http://t.co/AfHfsG6EOR it's awesome.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-29 13:38:56	Just remembered the best drink I've ever had. Pedro Ximenez Sherry, Spanish Brandy, coffee, lemon, ginger, soda &amp; fruit. Black Sangria. MMMM
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-29 13:58:37	@n0rm So that if that have a dinner date, they don't get any sleep the night before.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-04-29 13:59:30	@davinagifford I will have to buy bits and experiment with ratios this summer
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-03 13:31:43	Finally finished watching my way through Cleopatra 2525.  I started a few years ago, but each episode is so awful I need long breaks.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-03 13:48:49	My brother @thunderrage is doing Celine Dion at me over google talk. Today has hit an all time low.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-02 11:03:04	@julesmattsson Should make it illegal to threaten people with arrest for crimes that don't exist / arrest people for crimes that don't exist
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-01 10:03:46	@Brainmage But but but... I thought all the kids these days were using that one that supposedly self-destructs messages once read.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-03 10:28:33	@notlextalionis no point manually RTing people with protected tweets :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-03 10:29:11	@daniel_barker the No should be a 0-10 scale for how much you dislike it.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-04 15:24:15	Cityscape is up. http://t.co/cevN12LrNI :D
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-05 11:28:18	Round 1... Fight! http://t.co/dfI1g7ZShQ #fisticuffs
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-07 07:47:07	@Brainmage Strip snap.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-07 12:38:19	@victohenry go home meme, you're drunk.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-08 15:06:18	@Brainmage You satill could now. I bet it would look like you were straight out of the Beano too.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-10 07:22:57	@n0rm man, free breakfast sounds wonderful - is that regular there?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-10 07:24:13	@n0rm Social breakfast?  Cannibalism?  Are you eating your worst performing employee and discussing it over ribs? :D
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-10 07:24:57	@n0rm Ahhhhhh - special :D gotcha
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-10 07:49:46	This morning I have been reading up on Tesla a bit and then St. Elmo's Fire. #awesome
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-10 08:14:10	@EwaSR Happy birthday
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-10 10:32:06	Hmm, for my birthday this year, now quite tempted to go swim in a pool of blood.... http://t.co/GH6Pgkb2dm
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-10 10:39:33	@BugsMcgee Seeing it tonight!  Already interspersing my thoughts with PEW PEW and ZZsshhooooom sounds etc.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-10 15:16:06	@EwaSR Eh, the only After Earth that got me interested was that Titan A.E. film over a decade ago.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-10 15:16:46	@EwaSR omg what. Will Smith's character in that is called Cypher Raige?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-10 15:17:48	@EwaSR I'm glad someone else thinks this. Virtually no-one I know has seen it.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-10 15:29:11	@zeeblet @EwaSR http://t.co/9ngYI8ZA93 I have this poster in storage somewhere from when I was at uni :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-10 16:04:03	@ECHOcasts You should do a little webseries of Me, Myself, and KRIEG.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-10 16:06:00	@FloxxieWalker If it's not too much bother....   Sorry to trouble you but could you just.....   Or is it a question about chemical triggers?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-10 16:10:12	If you enjoyed the music while playing Fez, check out the remixes to the soundtrack - http://t.co/U5hHAPRMsG
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-07 15:55:22	@EwaSR try and stream it from somewhere?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-10 17:19:56	Old man sneers at me "What have you done to your hair?!" - "It's blue!" I exclaim like an idiot. #goodtalk
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-13 18:19:02	Watching the last film in our Hannibal movie marathon, with @laureation and a nice Chianti :9
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-13 18:53:09	And Hector Madden from The Hour just turned up, as what appears to be basically the same character.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-13 18:54:51	@FloxxieWalker #badfilmclub mmmm. Need something like Fortress 2 - or something sci fi with sharks.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-17 18:20:11	@fox_sake Here - https://t.co/ny0TAhXme5 - my friend there @n0rm is looking for a "super-savvy cloud-compatible tech architect"
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-18 08:06:08	Today and tomorrow I am learning to be a blacksmith with @laureation ( at the Bushfire Forge in Kent )
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-18 08:08:23	It's like walking into scrapheap challenge thus far http://t.co/2Z5PqRf5uF but with a forge.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-17 19:26:52	I can cause @laureation to suffer giggle fits just by eating a wispa. (I have a weird face or something when sucking chocolate bites)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-18 16:28:33	Exhausted from blacksmithing. Please will someone deliver food and gin to me, in my bath.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-20 08:05:20	WOOO ( cc @laureation ) - scored 2 tickets to swim in a swimming pool of blood for Resident Evil Revelations. #amaze #residentevil @RE_Games
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-20 08:06:57	Sold out within 5 mins. Hah. #smug
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-20 10:00:27	Happy Victoria Day @victohenry
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-20 10:09:44	Here's the ram's head poker, and two hooks I made while blacksmithing last weekend. http://t.co/2fyw9cZU1B
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-20 10:10:08	Detail on the poker head. #blacksmithing http://t.co/BqmdpnJL64
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-20 10:10:30	Decorative twisting #blacksmithing http://t.co/ywgvwIlMFi
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-20 10:10:46	The business end.  #blacksmithing http://t.co/XNeKuacPPP
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-20 10:23:42	@laureation Sat 25th. Actual details will come via email on the Friday according to the site.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-20 11:56:49	@Capcom_UK Can't wait!  Looking forward to diving for goodies!  Maybe I'll get a gall bladder.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-20 11:59:17	@FrogCroakley If you could make it randomly record segments of office conversation, distort them slightly, and play them around the room too
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-20 13:11:16	@dangusset Wow - this is awesome.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-18 18:12:32	Nothing like massive black bogies to remind you what a good and important job your nose does. Also ewww.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-22 12:58:11	@lucypapoosky books on self-hypnosis.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-22 13:29:57	Sometimes I paste a large buffer of code into my terminal window and pretend like I'm typing really quickly to scare less savvy colleagues.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-23 07:35:28	@dunos Disappointing it takes them this long to escalate things.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-23 08:12:00	@Brainmage Sugar Glass is not as delicious as it sounds :C Tastes like blood and hurting.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-23 08:50:36	@Capcom_UK While they are terribly sad events, this doesn't seem logical. They're not even remotely related subject matter or geography.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-23 08:56:12	@Miss_Cakehead @NathanPask So, er, Capcom uk just tweeted that the event has been cancelled.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-23 09:00:05	@notch Check out "Die by the sword". Old game, but excellent melee combat.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-23 09:11:29	@Miss_Cakehead Is it planned to be rescheduled?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-23 09:36:41	@BugsMcgee I think "wankstain" is perhaps a bit too nice.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-23 13:34:23	Every take a moment to sit back and wonder wtf you're doing? I just googled "Angry Ram Noises" then had to stop and think.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-23 13:34:44	It did lead me to this though - http://t.co/0qgTddzGHa  More like a belch imo though.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-21 08:58:18	@EwaSR Trapped in kibble.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-21 11:55:53	CYOA Lone Wolf books, app, for free? https://t.co/s82dOXqqzv ( cc @brainmage )
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-21 12:03:04	@FrogCroakley Manwitches. Not to be mistaken for manwiches which are just huge sandwiches.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-21 12:19:00	@AceyBongos Can people also queue it up online if they're at work?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-21 14:36:41	@undeadlabs Funnily enough I actually have one documented and ready. http://t.co/ZuQMAkKfYZ
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-21 14:37:19	@undeadlabs Food varies admittedly because, well, I eat and replace it often. Most of that stuff is with me all the time.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-21 14:38:10	@undeadlabs barring the gun though, that's fake. And it wouldn't be cool to take on the busses :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-21 16:27:33	@feliciaday it's not for about half an hour.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-24 08:33:34	@Stoooooooo Are the two people you, and the person sat in front of you?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-24 12:19:36	@akaikitsunechan EAT ALL OF THE TARTS
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-22 08:55:39	@Miss_Cakehead or body parts....
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-22 10:49:41	@dunos You know - relying on 3g doesn't count as "without internet"
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-22 12:54:56	@Miss_Cakehead on the thursday? O_O
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-22 13:06:58	@undeadlabs I'm somewhere in the middle at the moment.  I'm probably due to die to a fast zombie / inescapable trap combo.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-22 14:22:17	@hidingseeking Virgin on the tube?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-28 14:13:10	@akaikitsunechan with/on
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-30 08:32:50	@Trynottobreathe Yeah, you always see yourself reversed in mirrors as well so you may be thrown off by normality that way.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-30 10:56:03	@EwaSR like those goats which faint, hoping predators will think they're diseased?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-30 12:14:27	@Wangleberry You'd get an uncle turning up as a contemporary stage magician to be "edgy" and ruining the look.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-30 13:52:01	@AceyBongos I can warble faster than that. Pfft.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-30 13:58:54	@undeadlabs The Glitch Mob.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-30 13:59:28	@undeadlabs Lots without lyrics. I'm sure there are some with lyrics in there too but I prefer those without.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-30 15:13:18	@UpThatRock *SLUUUUURP* gone now.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-31 07:35:13	@MrLloydSpandex Ian is short for Killian. Nuff said
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-31 09:12:54	@Thunderrage He's DYING.... of shame.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-31 10:27:20	@JustEatUK you *have* to put a derp picture of my cat up. https://t.co/dkfGyXfPdH
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-31 10:30:04	@justeatuk here is a better one though - http://t.co/ic4dBRAUdN
18186373	dmatryx	2013-05-29 14:50:24	@akaikitsunechan seen it :D v cute ^__^
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-05 12:59:16	@Brainmage And the hats they wear are all code for things they like. Avoid deerstalkers and panama hats.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-05 13:59:16	@jenenifer 403 error - presumably not allowed referer hotlink thingy.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-05 14:09:35	@jenenifer That's a really hard to tell picture. I would suggest you look up "Deadnettle" - red/purple or henbit, They have similar leaves
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-05 14:12:03	@jenenifer And could be Lamium amplexicaule if there's no purple in the leaves.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-05 14:12:44	@jenenifer (turns out that's just another name for henbit - ignore that extra info then1)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-05 14:14:11	@jenenifer oh! if it's all over the ground it might be "Flirty Girl" - aka Glechoma hederacea http://t.co/Sc3oJkmc6A
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-05 14:15:47	@EwaSR checked by trying to remove the kidneys and seeing if they objected?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-05 14:17:20	@jenenifer Ah, blue flowers then? - could well be.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-05 14:18:41	@jenenifer If it's prickly that's quite likely.  Can grow over a metre tall if you let it.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-05 15:38:01	@FloxxieWalker http://t.co/c2jRumlLw5 Probably related.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-05 15:45:15	@FloxxieWalker Other than that retweet of yours I've not seen anything about that. Operation cubo is on again but that's not chinook worthy.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-05 15:50:43	@FloxxieWalker Police operation to get non-road-worthy cars off the road.  Happens semi-regularly all over the place. http://t.co/jLowMkz0IB
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-05 15:59:46	Arguing with a colleague over whether Up (the film) is a cartoon. I'm saying no because it isn't 2d.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-04 07:34:57	@Trynottobreathe Take all of the laptops with you when you go. Or at least all of the hard-drives.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-07 10:03:49	@zeeblet http://t.co/q3R5mLqO2s Cheer up :D
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-07 10:05:30	@zeeblet To(t)es awesome
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-07 10:14:11	@nickovdw Been watching Timecop again?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-07 10:21:34	Just told the ladies who bring the doughnut trolley around that they should get a jangly tune like the ice-cream vans. :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-07 10:52:06	@you_twits "The Net" and the repeater can be "Netforce"
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-07 10:56:34	@laureation Wow. That grill. Unbelievable
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-07 12:17:35	I *reeeeeeeealy* want to play Android: Netrunner, but unsure if I want to risk getting hooked.  At least it isn't a CCG though.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-04 10:00:00	Naked bike ride on Saturday.  Fear not, I'm not taking part.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-04 11:27:35	@Wangleberry That's what @laureation and I are doing. Still so many hoops though. Best revise for your green-card-test also!
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-04 11:41:14	@EwaSR So you'll resurface in about 3 months then.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-04 11:49:18	@EwaSR How are you on action/horror things?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-04 11:54:45	@EwaSR Both Batman - Arkham Asylum, and then Arkham City are excellent action games.  Some small rpg elements but no class choices etc.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-04 11:55:19	@Wangleberry Yeah - you get interviewed - separately. About the other person and family members etc. Nothing tricky tbh.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-04 11:56:22	@Wangleberry Though you have to answer the same for things like "What does HE do for a living". So good luck guessing @brainmage responses.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-04 11:58:36	@Wangleberry @brainmage *shrug* I presume something like that. We were just grateful we weren't asked about each other's parents jobs :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-04 12:12:59	@laureation @Wangleberry Hah - oh yeah, I forgot about that... and they were quick to add that "Cousins is ok". O_O er #no
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-04 12:27:55	@EwaSR You'll have to publish your gamertag if you go online, so @brainmage can call you a bum when you're too busy/cool to play with him
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-04 12:29:14	@Stoooooooo @jonanamary Pinched nerve perhaps?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-04 12:30:52	@zeeblet Here's the cure - https://t.co/AL6mVH4hsp #terrible #reallyterrible
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-04 12:31:39	I think this might actually be the worst thing I've ever listened to. https://t.co/AL6mVH4hsp
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-03 08:31:21	@WantonItalics Fill it with ants.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-04 15:11:01	@ThePCCLondon Already do this. :D
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-05 07:40:04	@UpThatRock Would love to but I have family commitments in Leicester :/
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-03 09:30:41	@kiell stringing up hammocks between chimney posts? :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-03 10:45:29	@laureation pretty sure O_o
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-03 14:38:56	Kid from @HarrisFed boy's in East Dulwich just punched our windows to scare our cats. Fiancee has phoned in complaint. Hope he gets told off

18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-03 16:04:54	@Duds_2k @alz I have a microSD which I have lost in my keyboard before. Only re-found it when cleaning between the keys :/
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-06 07:32:18	@EwaSR Maybe they were all taken over by the Mafia and everyone scarpered.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-06 08:14:35	@rocket_panda Release a really really bad game v quickly. Like a Q-Basic version of Snake or something.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-06 08:17:52	@rocket_panda Yeah, it sucks as a policy - can you withdraw it again afterwards?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-06 12:33:49	@spamvicious @zeeblet Rosie's right - they can't see anything at all, don't even get a hint you've tried to message them.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-06 12:34:12	@spamvicious @zeeblet DMs are different ofc, but they require following in both directions so it's a bit of a moot suggestion.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-06 12:37:53	@spamvicious @zeeblet if I were to guess I'd say re-send. From a programming point of view I would design it as an event trigger on creation
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-09 12:12:23	My nephews have an Operation! game themed around The Hulk.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-06 15:24:49	What's the etiquette when you see someone climbing with rings on? I tend to run at them going OH GOD NO NO NO NO PLEASE NO AAAAAAAAAAA.

18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-10 16:11:16	@Duds_2k This looks like a sitcom.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-10 16:11:33	@Duds_2k That suggest an edit link. "ALL OF THE EVERYTHING"

18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-10 13:46:27	@n0rm totally signing up now. Though I'm mostly bus these days it'll be nice to know it's automatic. tbh TFL should automagic it already!
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-10 13:56:03	@MrLloydSpandex Not at all, they're a doctor. Probably used to it.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-10 13:57:38	@MrLloydSpandex As opposed to "Can you look at my cock please, I think I fell on a pencil" and the other *really* unusual things they get.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-10 14:02:57	@MrLloydSpandex I suppose it depends on how you ask. e.g. Throwing youself down on the reclining exam table and shooting "come get me" eyes.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-10 14:09:18	@MrLloydSpandex Ah well just go with it then. #playingdoctor
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-10 14:19:48	@bobblebardsley @Brainmage Just burst onto stage and take over his show. He's a big pushover anyway.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-10 14:26:40	@Brainmage @lucypapoosky Burst out laughing at these two.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-10 14:30:06	@Brainmage Manual RT too much effort?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-10 14:31:31	@Brainmage er, as in type it all out by hand.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-10 14:35:56	@Brainmage oh right. Well I guess you've expended about as much energy explaining that as you could have manually RTing now.

18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-11 10:46:55	@EwaSR Can you somehow collect all the screams and market them somehow?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-11 12:38:41	@eat_news @SwearyTJ When this happened to me the store were falling over themselves trying to make it right when I went back. Good service!

18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-13 12:28:20	@Brainmage Ah, I'd previously only seen it in ants, which was bad enough.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-13 14:05:17	@Wangleberry I'd watch it.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-14 11:22:58	@laureation hah - wonderful :D
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-14 18:57:46	I thought that there was an animal trapped in distress nearby... Turns out it's actually just the house opposite teaching recorder lessons

18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-19 10:33:47	@Brainmage Sometimes I think you actually genuinely make a typo, sometimes I think you deliberately make one. This time I can't tell. c&lt;-&gt;p?

18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-20 11:36:01	@MrLloydSpandex Ah well, someone could have tried to tuck a label back in your jeans while it was happening, so not all bad, right?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-20 11:44:08	@MrLloydSpandex I'm waaaaayyyy too goth to go tanning. I'd be disavowed by the collective.

18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-21 10:36:12	I just inhaled some coffee.... but it just feels like really caffinated breathing rather than choking death. Oh wait, there's the choking.

18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-21 17:20:14	Also rather than announcing our platform they instead decided to prank all the commuters and change the board to read cancelled. Good job.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-06-21 17:21:10	They corrected it a couple of mins later, but that was a pretty nice panic stampede there for a while

18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-05 14:30:32	@n0rm 2/7 and those were just flukes.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-05 15:18:10	18-23 hrs to go MT: @LiamLonsdale: the live feed link for the British Bouldering Championships this weekend.. enjoy: https://t.co/KwlJ5COMcN
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-05 15:34:29	in the meantime, watching the Tierra Boulder Battle https://t.co/1vXa2fwhI6
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-05 16:00:56	@you_twits surprise! Grove Park next stop!
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-06 18:50:12	@jamiesmart lie on your back and draw upwards
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-01 10:21:30	@dunos @jamesoff @zeeblet @SockToi What incline can a roomba cope with.  Will ramps work?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-01 12:29:26	@Neris_k It's the only face I have :D
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-07 19:15:51	@CathTwo longboard?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-08 10:36:50	Just realised I didn't take any photos of my cats exhausted in melty-cat-piles from the weekend's heat.  They looked quite adorable.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-02 10:08:44	@dwylth @xerode I use this for texts etc http://t.co/2YMzxWP1uT
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-08 11:55:42	@WINDY_BUTT Try to end up with a 50:50 blood:sugar ratio.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-08 12:17:01	@WINDY_BUTT or like a split open doughnut.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-08 12:24:24	@n0rm is it a USB KEY TO THE CITY and made out of decorative iron?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-08 12:39:58	@Brainmage Wet shirt compo? You and me. The guy with the fewest audience members throwing up wins.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-08 13:46:47	@EwaSR Are you saying you actually don't have twice as much leg as everyone else? #surprised
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-08 14:41:54	@jamiesmart It's entirely possible. My thinkpad underclocks itself when it gets hot so it can keep working without failing.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-08 15:47:26	@n0rm Yeah, I think my brother tried to endorse his friend for knowledge of chickens or something
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-09 10:24:25	Anyone have any recommendations for not terrible place to buy a road bike in London? Thinking of starting to cycle in.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-09 10:36:38	@zeeblet @SockToi Mmm, all opinions / advice welcome.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-09 10:45:13	@jamesoff There's an Evans near to my office. Might have a wander over and see.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-09 10:48:43	@zeeblet best bee
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-09 10:58:13	@_DanielFinn Just watching your commentary on the 2013 British Bouldering Champs. Great to see it recorded as I couldn't make it myself!
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-09 12:05:14	@Duds_2k Thanks Duds. In theory distance isn't an issue due to leaving with a bike.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-09 12:05:49	@Brainmage I'll manually RT it, then you can RT my manual.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-09 12:06:08	RT: @Brainmage: RT is you think that 'Gloucester' would be a good name for a toad.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-09 12:45:42	@SockToi ~£400 plus locks/helm after, Road/Hybrid commuting / No, buying outright / optional / approachable friendly not rip off prices.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-09 14:03:16	@Brainmage You should, but get critical details wrong (or very very right).

18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-09 15:14:58	@Thunderrage I wanted to do Yurkie but that's not biscuit
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-09 15:15:36	@Duds_2k @Thunderrage Oh, then previous tweet fo'reals.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-09 15:40:08	@arunhorne Thanks, but at this stage I think I need face to face advice more and to actually sit on things :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-09 16:22:56	@MrLloydSpandex Too often means you just have a semi-permanent tab.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-11 07:22:43	@victohenry Please to be tagging the outside of the shard for me. My tag looks like this [Unintelligable Scrawl]
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-11 07:29:42	@emotionalpedant If you're a fan of terrible shark movies there's also Avalanche Sharks with Hulk Hogan's daughter in it. ( cc @jamiesmart )
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-11 07:49:58	@jamiesmart @emotionalpedant It could be a spin-off of Sharky and George.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-10 13:19:30	@zeeblet can I recommend you get a little mosquito-netting cover for that window you keep leaving open? :P
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-10 13:22:30	@zeeblet pay attention in bioligy class!Every year they emerge in early July from riverbeds and beaches hunting for warm eyeballs to nuzzle.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-10 14:14:22	@Wangleberry Me too.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-11 12:09:54	@severalbees The solution is sugar-highs instead?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-10 16:31:20	@UpThatRock Curious goat on a top out.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-11 15:24:29	@UpThatRock spinach and banana together? really? I am unconvinced
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-11 15:26:35	@UpThatRock Generally I prefer smoothies without banana - they tend to be more interesting flavours without the overwhelming banana taste.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-11 15:27:01	@UpThatRock though more expensive as well because bananas are large and cheap.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-11 15:30:52	@UpThatRock I'm quite partial to blueberry / ginger / lime combo.  Though apple / ginger / mint is also good in my book.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-11 15:33:48	@UpThatRock oo! Pre-make strawb sorbet then White Run / Lime Juice / Splash of orange juice / fresh strawberries / ice + sorbet
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-11 15:34:23	@UpThatRock white run should be white rum.  As for actual ingredients, I generally throw whatever I have around into a bigass blender.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-11 15:34:52	@UpThatRock Apples are cheap and bulk up nicely, as do bananas. Peel and core them first and it'll be less bitty.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-11 15:36:04	@UpThatRock Mango works as a good banana substitute. Sweet and creamy.  I use milk or greek yoghurt for adding volume. Generally wing it tho
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-11 15:37:47	Hmm, that reminds me, I should make some lime sorbet again.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-10 17:12:43	@UpThatRock ah, thought you were talking about climbing problems
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-09 21:19:57	@SockToi michos thankees. Shall shop and wander on sat i think
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-11 15:43:53	@baneparkour @UpThatRock Only downside with winging it is I often end up with 2l of smoothie suddenly from adding a bit here/there to taste
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-12 12:31:20	@MrLloydSpandex Please rate the following smells for attractiveness. Smoking, Sausages, XXXTREME MINT, Vinegar, Pink-Shrimps, Pine, Cheese.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-12 12:31:37	@MrLloydSpandex Not all together ofc.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-12 12:32:42	Only one lunch hour - do I watch the semi-finals of the BBC or start to watch the women's lead climbing qualifies for ECC
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-12 12:34:06	BBC = British Bouldering Championships. ECC = European Climbing Championships btw.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-12 12:35:55	@zeeblet the BBC is already one screen split into 4 so you can watch the current 8 competitors on the wall (group rotating every 5 mins)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-12 12:36:39	@zeeblet Ok - bad example, but scroll back to 57 mins in
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-12 12:36:53	@zeeblet *grumble grumble random time grab fail*
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-12 13:28:02	Colleague just bought me a feast. :9 Perhaps in return I will not complain about him this afternoon.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-14 18:47:26	It may be 400 degrees outside but @laureation and I see still doing our Sunday night chilli. Today: extra spicy! :9 http://t.co/gE4QaztdnN
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-13 10:27:42	My coffee from @beanandground just arrived! Just brewing now. :9 http://t.co/oLlx8WYh8f
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-14 20:13:46	Currently watching a jazz sax rendition of "time after time"
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-15 07:45:36	.@Laureation reminded me of this AWESOME show over the weekend. TimeTrax. Think Quantum Leap meets The One meets Timesplitters meets Timecop
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-15 07:46:42	criminals are escaping to the past using TRAX. Supercop has to catch them. He has a time-gun and a hologram computer assistant SELMA.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-15 07:47:33	He's like engineered to be amazing, can swim underwater as fast as people can sprint,etc etc. Must re-watch it.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-15 07:48:47	Oh yeah, I think his gun prop was just a repurposed tv remote control. His hologram was a credit card sleeve... #quality
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-15 08:08:13	omg. @laureation Robot Unicorn Attack.... 2! : https://t.co/m1xWY55FvQ (cc @vigour Chanelle can use this even if there's no IOS ver for you)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-15 08:39:36	@n0rm [ cc @marmite ] With so many people (myself included) generating filter addresses why do companies think they can get away with this?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-16 11:14:52	Deux/South - Sequel show because we need more mounties. #geniusidea
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-16 11:32:04	@zeeblet print it and hang it on your wall.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-16 11:34:52	@zeeblet I was picturing just frame 1 actually. So you'd have cold unfeeling penguin staring at you demanding your motivation.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-15 11:41:31	@jamiesmart I tend to be the opposite. Heat makes me lose my appetite.  One of us is not normal here.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-15 13:55:43	@UpThatRock Instagram that so those of us stuck in an office can live through you!
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-15 14:02:08	@UpThatRock well enjoy the sun. Stuck at my desk so watching the finals of the BBC from sheffield finally. Next up IFSC lead climbing champs
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-15 14:13:58	Argh. Just dug like a bit of chilli or something out of my nail and now I can't feel my tongue.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-16 15:40:35	@Brainmage I'm going climbing first. I may have to be scraped off a rock first.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-16 15:51:38	@daniel_barker *wring? Though the concept of throwing sodden pants out of a ring is still p. funny.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-16 18:06:55	Good climbing session but approx temp of mercury now http://t.co/nZb27ojWhO
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-17 10:14:00	@victohenry I've been following that. I pick up my new bike this evening, so next thing on my agenda is getting a will formalized I think.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-17 10:21:02	@victohenry I think @laureation would get the cats :P but if I die in a tandem collision with her, then you can have the angry one.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-17 10:21:43	@victohenry and I'm hopefully getting a Trek 8.1 DS.  Hybrid bike from Evans near to my office.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-17 13:03:08	I can recommend some good veggie restaurants also.  RT @Brainmage and meat too. Disgusting stuff. Thought of eating any is making me sick.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-17 13:48:31	@Brainmage Too hot! All your little dudes are going to be poached in your juices by the end of the day.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-17 14:04:18	@n0rm Broken air conditioner repair man. You constantly move from sweltering office to unbearable stagnant, never benefiting from your work.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-18 10:35:52	@iamannaisabel @dorsetcereals @MajorXIII You're an unrepenting cereal killer!
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-18 10:44:37	@dorsetcereals @iamannaisabel @MajorXIII Now I want a cereal fountain on my desk so I can just scoop a new bowl now and again.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-18 10:47:45	@dorsetcereals @iamannaisabel @MajorXIII I can see Anna's climbing suffering greatly after she takes up this new job. #cerealbaby
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-18 14:03:03	@severalbees That sounds really interesting.  Cash in the e-attic etc etc
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-22 07:42:48	oh my GOD. SPACETEAM IS ON ANDROID NOW.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-22 10:05:32	I know I say this occasionally, but why are faxes still a thing. I mean really, they're been replaced by better options in almost every case
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-22 10:33:55	@daniel_barker Also, things like "car porn" - they're not actually porn! (well, ok, I'm sure there *is* actual car porn as well.....)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-22 10:47:43	@daniel_barker Technical Anal-ist
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-22 11:01:06	@jonanamary Nobody shares an internet connection! Ewww... That'd be like sharing a toothbrush or something.

18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-19 06:55:36	First day cycling into the office. 39 mins (5.5/6 miles ish) and I don't quite feel like throwing up or anything.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-19 06:57:39	look! Bike! http://t.co/6Vn8k3qfJp
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-19 07:16:40	Amaze - my colleague happened to bring in extra lucozade today.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-19 07:28:32	@xerode I play (really really badly) :D
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-19 07:28:40	@xerode so does @thunderrage
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-19 07:30:32	@xerode Can't remember if I have you on steam or not.  my steam username is d_matryx   currently showing as [D]Matryx as my name.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-19 07:34:07	@xerode Username on Frozen Synapse is "matryx" and I play on UK1 if they still have distributed servers.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-19 07:36:30	@TlfTravelAlerts #FF is for dogs chasing cylists across the park in the morning.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-19 07:42:59	@arunhorne I'm not getting fast enough for far enough yet to make that worthwhile. Eventually though :D
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-19 08:08:25	@xerode And now thanks to you I just watched a trailer for Hotline Miami and I want the soundtrack.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-19 08:12:03	@xerode Nope - I maaaay have to buy it even.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-19 11:15:53	@daniel_barker Yes, of course.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-19 11:29:00	@daniel_barker perpetually tomorrowterday.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-20 21:18:24	I have a new most hated song ever. "Jesus take the wheel" by Carrie Underwood. Religious tripe with a really really terrible message.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-20 21:21:16	Hmm. All of her songs are terrible. @laureation is now playing me "before he cheats" which seems to be about pre emptive revenge
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-23 11:45:21	@akaikitsunechan failed DM? :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-25 13:19:45	@fox_sake Where abouts is this? O_o
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-25 13:21:05	@fox_sake Probably why I've not noticed it then. Over at blackfriars here. They'd be doing really well to have gotten away this far.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-25 13:28:08	@fox_sake Thanks - have passed on to everyone I know in the area
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-25 14:13:38	@daniel_barker giving or receiving? Can't get enough of both myself.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-25 14:14:22	@daniel_barker Everyone I know who's been like that has been more of a "don't like giving" when you cut away the waffle
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-25 14:23:33	@daniel_barker Yeah, I don't understand that.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-26 09:43:55	@daniel_barker I would not be surprised if there was a porn star called "Merry River"
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-26 10:06:05	Technical Anal-ist Also, things and meat too. pay attention in London? Thinking of a bike. Just have. — http://t.co/Wp9yhek0KL
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-26 10:07:05	@Brainmage You have distilled it down to pure essence.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-26 10:13:33	I just frame 1 actually. So this is sort of her bum off surprise! Grove Park next stop! fft fft fft fft! — http://t.co/Wp9yhek0KL
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-26 10:23:12	Today is Marcus' 3 year adoption anniversary :) Gonna be all of the play tonight. Unless he's being grouchy
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-26 10:57:01	@Chan315 You're very welcome.  Good luck!
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-26 08:34:02	@Brainmage Next time just load up some racing music on your phone. Or something really dramatic at least.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-26 08:37:40	@Brainmage That's more terrifying really, not epic enough. How about this....http://t.co/ZUKSBIIkUf
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-26 08:39:44	@Brainmage Though it does take about 3 mins to really start getting into it. Might be too long.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-26 09:36:46	I laughed at this, then felt a bit bad for doing so http://t.co/yF4sHRZ7zK #cat
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-26 10:04:40	@lucypapoosky Check out the first one mine generated

18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-25 09:32:15	@darkrock That I can't help you with I'm afraid - but you can discount the entire suggestion by checking the channel of the wifi.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-25 09:32:41	@darkrock Just set up a few office devices recently which thought they were US things and couldn't see channels 12 &amp; 13 at all.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-25 09:43:23	@mangmangmang Rain is generally clean enough that if you dry it after you'll be fine.  If you don't dry it then it'll need washing again.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-25 09:44:02	@mangmangmang Dry it, and then see if it smells like damp towels. If it does - give it another wash.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-25 09:49:15	@Laureation I've just counted and I've only used (and booked) 16.5 holiday days so far this year.  I have 30, but will probably carry 5 over
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-25 09:49:53	@Laureation How much do you have remaining, aside from the wedding time off?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-29 07:36:34	@citycyclists I was fortunate and got to sit in the driver's cab of one of those last week. Giving at least 2m clearance on all sides now.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-29 07:37:15	@citycyclists Terrifying how little you can see from in them, even with a million mirrors!
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-29 11:35:15	@victohenry Butliiiiiins
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-29 11:37:31	@victohenry #quicksilver and the games machines were all class. I remember riding on my dad's shoulders down the high street ^__^
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-29 11:37:49	@victohenry and the Aquasplash! omg so many memories.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-29 11:59:10	@ppiixx @n0rm Use a different phone when phoning your "bank" back.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-29 15:49:29	Awesome - have my next bike skills lesson booked up. Going to take me up and around Elephant and Castle, maybe even deal with the roundabout
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-29 15:50:16	It is however the day before my wedding.  Navigating terrifying road systems couldn't possibly be a bad idea then could it?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-29 15:52:40	@jamesoff I'm going to Elephant and Castle roundabout ^__^
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-29 16:12:51	@you_twits Pedal. But yeah, cycleconfident are taking me round under instruction which will help nerves massively.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-29 16:16:13	@you_twits hah - Thus far I've been completely avoiding it by crossing further east. mmm bikehub quiet routes.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-29 18:22:05	@myboxoftricks aug 24th is the big day :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 11:27:43	@notch top tip: don't make it about you. Like you are doing now.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 12:29:21	@xerode Better not be mine (http://t.co/gDQSij0v0p / http://t.co/xLMYdAzZt2 / some others)  :D
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 12:30:48	@xerode Brand it "Kick up the ass-ter"
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 12:39:47	@n0rm Have them make you a signature stamp thing.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 12:54:03	@xerode @Wangleberry That's about what I'd value my UX contributions at tbh.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 14:52:11	@_hazelaine @JustEatUK Halloumi. All the time. Non-stop. Can't get enough of that salty squeaky cheese. I'm drooling just thinking about it.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 10:52:25	@xerode They punch things yes? :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 10:55:46	@xerode :D I prefer the dark extermination mode, but the others are good now and then.  Btw, I play loser re-challenges. To avoid doubling.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 10:56:13	@xerode and I would hardly say I'm "good" by any stretch. You've out maneuvered me expertly several times so far.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 10:57:29	@xerode The latter.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 10:58:37	@xerode don't know if you've come across it yet, but you can get lopsided games. If you end up with only rocket guys you basically lose.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 10:58:48	@xerode two shots and there are no walls to explode against anymore.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 11:00:23	@xerode feel free to use any and all tactics to win against me. Unless you find actual exploits I guess.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 11:01:34	@xerode That sounds like a good idea. I should do that sometime.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 12:26:07	@xerode also do it for mates rates. i.e. a 6 pack and an afternoon of pizza. Why is it not done yet.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 12:29:41	@xerode but if you do copy it - do it exactly. Including requirement for domain name etc
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 12:34:16	@xerode If they're only just wanting to get into crowd funding though they've missed the boat by quite a way.  Next up... "Yourspace!"
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 12:53:16	@Wangleberry @xerode That's the other thing. Not a designer &gt;_&lt; If you want your user-experience to be elitist and old-skool then sure.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 14:53:00	@victohenry for money, not for dating.  OOOO BURN. ( just kidding :D )
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-31 14:58:16	@Wangleberry Send them the feedback, with feedback on.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-31 15:56:54	@daniel_barker more like Cutieform Dating. #amirite

18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-31 16:19:47	@ChrisWarr I'm going to go and trade mine in to CEX or something for a quid. That's 100 penny sweets to eat while playing. cc @AceyBongos
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 07:34:02	@peterwalker99 @citycyclists Since I started commuting in by bike just two weeks ago, my stress levels have dropped massively. Despite vans!
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 10:54:02	@xerode in half of my planning phases, you got off the shot before I shot you. Then I managed to find a sweet spot.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 12:27:59	@xerode The *really* sad thing is - some of them are not bad ideas. But I'm not sinking my time/money on a risky gamble for someone else.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 12:31:15	@xerode http://t.co/Fph1h72YZm  No funding. We're doing it all ourselves. *pulls company up by bootstraps*.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 12:36:10	@xerode Lots of projects fall foul of my big "How are you going to monetise this?"
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 12:40:23	@n0rm ..... +"in the shape of their signatures"
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 12:59:22	@xerode I'm surprised this is news to people. If I had veto power I'd totally use it. Especially if I was crazy old and stuck in my ways.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 13:54:37	@xerode http://t.co/OehuycZ173 looks relevant to you
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-30 14:50:44	@victohenry in this case, faster to walk outside and find a 2p. Or walk around the amusements and look in the reject slots.

18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-01 06:52:00	@EwaSR Contact your council's noise team about it. I've always been impressed with how efficient they are (and it is anonymous too)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-31 11:25:58	@rocket_panda eye-tracking?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-07-31 11:28:58	@rocket_panda Shush you, My ideas are without flaws I tell you! without flaws!

18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-01 06:53:08	@hengineer Yeah... just ignore them. Cross platform support is still a feature of the iOS version (p.s. &lt;3 the android version :D )
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-02 08:01:08	@EwaSR Beachcomber Zombie? You know the original cocktail was revolutionary in the amount of alcohol it disguised with fruity flavours.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-02 08:02:39	@EwaSR Beach, who invented it, never revealed recipe but it's been heavily copied over the years. Named from the state you are in afterwards
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-03 08:37:02	One of our cats has vanished.If you're SE22 please check rooms/cellars/sheds in case the wind has trapped him inside. http://t.co/0chn7NJeJu
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-03 08:39:31	His brother pictured here with him is awfully sad at the moment. If you find Marcus (the B/W one) let us know! http://t.co/VtKudUggHl
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-04 16:28:51	Still no sign of Mr Marcus. I hope he's ok :/
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-05 07:17:31	@Dollymopp Thanks! I shall do.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-05 07:19:13	.@TweetsDulwich Any chance you can RT this pic https://t.co/s6HNzZlVpN - Marcus, missing from Friern Road E.Dulwich since thursday.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-05 07:34:21	And thanks to everyone else who has been RTing @laureation and my tweets about Marcus.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-05 08:33:12	@myboxoftricks Thanks Mitch.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-05 10:02:54	You'd think that "shaved ferret" would be a euphamism for something but it doesn't appear to be. Also this : http://t.co/55nQMZf1Ut
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-05 10:08:13	@TweetsDulwich Thank you!
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-05 14:28:45	@EwaSR @Brainmage @KnightmareLive He's just v. small. Not far away at all.

18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-06 14:12:54	Hey @streetshirts - how come the delay in my order? ( order ref b27j38gn9k7k ) Ordered on the 30th, dispatch est 1st, still not dispatched.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-07 11:05:26	@daniel_barker can I join your syndicake? :9
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-10 06:22:42	V Happy to report that Marcus is home again. Trying to act like he's not been gone or anything.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-10 06:38:37	Just look at this dude . http://t.co/ByDSzpGPk0
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-08 14:12:57	@jamiesmart Hah - I didn't realise you actually sent those out. I just RT'd it because it was awesome.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-08 15:01:41	Work is sending me to Estonia. The hotel has a spa where I can get "treatments" like "The Classic Facial". #dubious
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-08 15:58:46	@citycyclists That's gotta be a photoshop surely. Or cyclist heaven.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-09 08:25:48	@citycyclists This morning I saw 3 vehicles and 3 cyclists RLJ. All overtaking me in an ASL to do it, tailgating convoy. Couldn't believe it
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-09 10:01:06	@citycyclists To be fair, this is a chicken and egg problem. They need uptake to justify charging, but need charging for people to uptake
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-09 11:45:28	@hengineer Absolutely loving spaceteam on android. Ships cat is a most 'welcome' addition to the crew. Any tips for improving WIFI detection
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-09 11:46:07	@hengineer it can be quite a few attempts at creating a lobby before I can get my devices to see each other using a wifi hotspot on my phone

18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-12 08:22:23	@Snuffel16 Eh, I'm responsible for a project launch, and while trying to launch it I've had 3 unrelated systems fall over and die.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-12 08:22:58	@Snuffel16 I literally have 4 screens up (two laptops) and am working on all of them concurrently with time critical patches / fixes.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-12 08:27:16	@Snuffel16 perhaps the worst part is I'm busting for a wee but too busy right now to go!

18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-13 08:31:50	@Wangleberry They always rely on the fact it takes about 2 years before anyone finds out they were wrong.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-13 14:00:05	@EwaSR Nah, it's food for later.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-13 16:18:05	@daniel_barker The best sort of incorrect.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-14 14:52:23	@archclimbing awesome
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-15 08:58:28	@n0rm @CathTwo Yeah, the guys in the office are lucky if I have anything approaching a smooth face. I shave when I get home, for my laydeee
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-15 12:42:38	@victohenry Er, cautions are part of your criminal record.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-16 11:42:24	@laureation Awww :)  My work team only just noticed I'm wearing a shirt. Good effort guys.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-16 16:04:39	@streetshirts Have done just a minute ago with detailed explanation :) Thanks
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-16 16:16:25	@streetshirts Well this is my ticket now https://t.co/X7pZ4CCdbS  Would love to place this order before I leave the office.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-16 16:31:27	@NotRollergirl maybe that's old slang for generation.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-14 14:50:01	@jayforeman Is it from yourself?

18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-15 12:57:57	Wooo - confirmation my bike is registered on http://t.co/M2gfoZYYYx :)  Took a little while from the police marking event but all done now.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-15 13:36:21	@Wangleberry Why did all the chicks dig Jesus so much?  Because he was hung like this *throws arms out wide* #bestworstjoke

18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-18 18:21:14	Just decanted about half a litre of forest from my socks.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-16 15:40:00	Hey @streetshirts I'm trying to place an order and use the £10 gift voucher code you sent me as apology but it isn't working. Any tips?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-16 20:28:10	After training our cats to lick or toes  @laureation and I have a greater understanding into their grooming dynamics. Aurie tickles too much
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-16 20:32:35	By comparison, Marcus licks like a big softie. Probably why Marcus hates being groomed by Aurie but Aurie can't get enough from Marcus.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-24 12:57:10	Married! http://t.co/YzfjZd8Uvm
18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-27 08:59:00	Off to Amsterdam for honeymoon with @laureation. We're delayed (fog), but Bertrand here has offered to fly ahead. http://t.co/TxU6bokVcP

18186373	dmatryx	2013-08-28 16:56:44	@laureation @nickovdw while they stare at me, I'm busy gazing lovingly at you. It's like a Mexican attention-off our something.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-02 07:08:34	I'm not even technically back at work yet and I'm overwhelmed/swamped already. Plus catchup work? Sounds like a week of hell just starting.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-05 04:49:00	Still working in office. Getting pretty tired now though.  I have to check out of my hotel in just over 4 hours and I've not been there yet.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-05 04:50:44	It is getting light enough outside that I noticed that it is starting to get light.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-04 09:52:44	I was linked to this amazing video by @akaikitsunechan and you should all watch it. http://t.co/wC5r3xCNNA
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-04 13:19:15	Shockingly - despite having hours and hours of work ahead of me for through the night, I'm feeling ahead of the game right now.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-04 13:19:26	Might just be sugar-rush from eating doughnuts though.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-06 15:46:16	@Brainmage from the inside, or from the outside?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-04 22:26:17	@EwaSR my cats do that all the time. Totally a thing.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-09 16:18:42	@jamiesmart Recommend "Fudging Holes" as a replacement.  Happy to help!

18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-12 11:50:12	@remerson Which bits are bad? I live nr Peckham, cycle to B/friars but have to go to Pad every 2 weeks. Haven't biked that yet but want to.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-12 11:58:43	@remerson I may be just fortunate enough to angle myself towards Lambeth Bridge and avoid all of those. Thanks for the heads up.

18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-18 09:08:04	Hey @citymapperlon - Will you consider adding voice directions to cycling mode? It's dangerous to bike and read at the same time.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-18 09:08:44	.@citymapperlon Er, for the Android version specifically, since that's what I use - but I'm sure iPhone users would love it also!

18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-24 10:31:33	@AgaSiemi Unlike other vehicles, pedal cycles are not required to light up when conditions of seriously reduced visibility occur in daytime.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-24 10:33:57	and cc @citycyclists - http://t.co/M6c1OjopMJ - lights in fog not legally required (though you really should use them for sanity reasons)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-24 10:36:19	Told another cyclist he was a v.good cyclist and it was a pleasure to have been cycling following. He thought I was being sarcastic :/
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-24 10:38:11	@Thunderrage I ended up cycling along in parallel to reassure him I meant what I had said and that he should keep up the good stuff.

18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-26 12:17:00	Oh god I have a black tie event next thursday.  Do I even have a tux that fits? How about a white dress shirt? #AAAAaaaaaaa
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-26 12:24:20	@dwylth Good idea - I'll check my wardrobe first though, but I can meanwhile look for places near my office to rent from :)

18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-23 15:52:34	@fwong I still think you're right, that they'll be targetting women more, I'm just curious if it'll show they actively go out of their way

18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-30 15:17:44	@cyclegaz Where did you go for it and what did it entail? I bought a recommended bike size for my height, but that's the extent of my "fit"
18186373	dmatryx	2013-09-30 15:25:40	@cyclegaz Wow - reading up on what they actually do. Sounds pretty intense. Not cheap either, but I'm sure it's worth it.

18186373	dmatryx	2013-10-11 08:06:13	Looks like I'm due to be cycling home in the rain. Was lucky enough to avoid it on the way in at least. #splosh

18186373	dmatryx	2013-10-12 11:32:00	@n0rm @CathTwo that is a completely new lawn. From scratch. New soil etc. It's only one month old. Amazed it has grown through at all yet.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-10-11 08:49:18	@Rainmates Ah, but you don't have anything visible, like my fluorescent tights. I'd rather be wet and seen!
18186373	dmatryx	2013-10-12 10:42:31	Made a bench and table for the garden :) http://t.co/h3OHh95QKB

18186373	dmatryx	2013-10-18 08:43:02	@markbikeslondon V good writeup - though perhaps you should mention that "cyclist dismount" signs are advisory only / have no legal weight?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-10-18 08:43:31	@markbikeslondon And are only typically used as a means for companies to dodge liability rather than actually helping protect cyclists :/

18186373	dmatryx	2013-10-22 09:00:42	@Wangleberry Limit Break: Over-emphatic sigh. Leaves everyone feeling like they should ask what's up, but no-one really wants to.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-10-22 09:01:36	@JustEatUK Yeah, I love pizza more than that guy because I actually like to eat mine, rather than bathing in it.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-10-22 09:02:08	@JustEatUK Seriously? You'd need another pizza-bath just to clean off the first one. Then - OH NOES - still "saucy", best have another pizza

18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 09:53:25	@daniel_barker Or the over-awareness of you?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 11:35:24	@GBCycleEmbassy I use headphones for satnav voice directions. I can still hear everything through them. What magic headphones does he have?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 11:36:12	@GBCycleEmbassy Or does he think all people blaze along on bikes listening to heavy metal blaring at hearing damaging volumes all the time?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 11:37:43	.@mayorofLondon so you think my wearing headphones makes me an absolute scourge? You do realise I can hear everything through them right?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 11:38:17	.@mayorofLondon Plus, voice based satnav directions through headphones are way safer than, for example, glancing at a device on handlebars.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 11:39:40	.@mayorofLondon Do you feel the same way about traffic in noise insulating cars, windows up, and music playing loud enough to hear outside?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 11:44:39	@DavidRMock Butting in to your question here, sorry, but I use headphones for voice satnav (bikehub) so I don't have to look away from road.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 11:46:15	@DavidRMock I personally would advise against music at a volume for example that you can't hear people just talking normally over.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 11:48:57	@Pablo_Burt Blanket ban is stupid. HPs safer in some cases. I use mine for audible satnav, rather than looking at device, e.g. on handlebars
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 11:59:34	@Pablo_Burt More dangerous to look away from road, I can hear normal volume conversation through HP. Do you oppose car stereos/windows also?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 12:00:21	@Pablo_Burt I do agree that anything quetining the road will inhibit your senses initially, but you adjust v quickly. Try earplugs for a day
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 12:04:35	@Pablo_Burt I just meant that a very short time after putting them in you can hear normally unless you have special noise-nullifying HPs
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 12:05:01	@Pablo_Burt or are listening to music, which I wouldn't advocate.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 12:08:17	@Pablo_Burt :) Should you ever need satnav, use bikehub. Only satnav I know with audio readout. Even with one-ear in it's safer than looking
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 17:06:21	@citycyclists This article reads like "I'm a massive tool who flaunted the rules. But I assume everyone else does to so fnarr."
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-19 17:47:38	@n0rm I think only fifteen of them were fined.Also, they were fined. Why were they not stopped from continuing to drive right there and then
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-22 16:02:37	@jayforeman If that's a FPN you may be able to contest it as excessive, and FPN for minor cycling offenses usually doesn't exceed £30.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-22 16:03:00	@jayforeman You'd have to request a court hearing though.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-22 16:41:59	@jayforeman Ah, fair enough then. Didn't know it had jumped. Cycle safe :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-22 16:53:46	@cyclegaz I notice in this video you have what looks like GPS / Map data overlaid at the bottom of the video. Is that new?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-20 11:55:21	@JustEatUK Where are your offices?  No snow here in Cirencester
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-22 13:46:34	@daniel_barker http://t.co/nGggW9vCQg exists - but I don't think it's just on other animals.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-22 15:08:29	@JonGracey It's very, er, tall. Tall things are good.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-21 09:38:29	Head wind this morning was the worst so far this year. Coming over Blackfriars Bridge felt like repeatedly cycling into a cold wall.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-20 16:33:12	@JustEatUK My regular office is in London. Feel like I missed out now.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-27 08:33:50	@Wangleberry Yep - working over Xmas.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-27 11:13:05	@severalbees Do you just mean the hash key three keys to the right of the L key? O_o or do you use some sort of moon keyboard?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-25 11:31:52	@cyclegaz As I was growing up, I was more familiar with programming than america.  $ will always be a "string" sign to me before a dollar.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-25 11:32:18	@cyclegaz ( %varname was a numeric variable, $varname was a string variable )
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-25 11:33:02	@cyclegaz In my head, I still say " Jay-String " for $j even though it's no longer the case specifically.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-25 11:41:06	@cr3 "Not" "Argued a lot, but Hash/Pound/Number Sign/Octothorpe/Comment" "Or" "Scope Operator"
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-25 11:41:51	@cr3 Octothorpe is my favourite.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-26 16:53:34	Trouble with targetted advertising is that because I don't browse I end up getting adverts for the specific things that I have just bought.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-26 17:20:00	@Thunderrage no-one uses this machine except me.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-25 14:59:17	@EwaSR You should re-tweet that with the hashtag they suggest at the bottom there.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-28 09:23:53	Someone in the office just said "mouth to mouth advertising". I don't think I want to correct them, it might end up hilarious later.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-28 11:41:54	@Brainmage There'd be an industry for fashionable neck supports.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-28 13:35:34	@Wangleberry @daniel_barker Figs? Full o' wasps. http://t.co/pJ3v0BVkO8 (maybe not full, but "an acceptable amount" of wasps)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-28 13:37:12	@Wangleberry @daniel_barker My favourite part is the one about the fig itself digesting the wasps in the wrong bits of the plant.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-28 16:38:42	@dwylth Why would he want to hank you later? #deliberatelymisreading
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-28 17:19:59	@JustEatUK This is the first time I've bothered to enter one of these. Here's hoping the universe smiles on my pizza-box finding skills.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-28 17:27:44	@laureation I notice a far greater amount of "not-in-service" just at the start of rush hour. Like they all decided to take a break then.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-28 20:59:08	Person in front of me on the bus was just eating orange peel, bit by bit.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-28 21:05:45	Sat next to cute person on the bus. I wonder if she's noticed me. (Of course she has, I have massive red hair) (also it's my wife)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-28 21:12:25	Had the *most* lime-y food ever this evening. Was like my tastebuds were mugged and beaten up by swanky sharp dressed citrus.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-29 09:08:26	@NotRollergirl so just "Friday" then?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-29 12:55:41	@BBCTomEdwards So that is hundreds upon hundreds per day. Perhaps warranting a full time (plainclothes even) traffic presence?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-02 09:09:07	@Duds_2k Both are shocking. The first is idiotic, the latter have been law for ~10 years now.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-02 09:55:10	@markbikeslondon I did that, but despite how good it is it doesn't show how massively their blind spot changes as they start to turn.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-02 09:55:35	@markbikeslondon Everywhere you would normally be visible, is suddenly a blind spot when they are just a degree or two off centre.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-02 09:57:09	@Brainmage Have you tried Almond milk? I shudder at the thought of it.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-02 11:54:57	@kiell What's the difference? For those of us completely out of the scene. Is it just the history or are they different things entirely?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-02 11:57:20	@kiell so FR is like the showboating brother of PK? #simplified
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-02 15:29:45	@cyclegaz You'd have to be pretty full of yourself surely.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-02 15:32:41	@JacobWilson21 @cyclegaz That makes sense actually. I can totally imagining internet-stardom going to people's heads though :D
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-02 16:11:39	@victohenry Climbing is a dirty sport not befitting a lady ofc.  You can't climb in all those hoopy-gowns.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-02 16:14:25	@victohenry I now need to see you ballgown climbing.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-02 16:14:53	@white_mischief @victohenry Dem's proper climbing shoes.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-02 16:15:28	@white_mischief @victohenry Though I am legit cringing at the prospect of just landing in those heels from even that short height.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-02 16:31:03	@Thunderrage @victohenry @white_mischief I don't even want to ask why you have heels that will fit me.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-02 16:56:18	@nickovdw I'm going to go and tap in random tracking numbers now.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-02 17:03:11	@MrLloydSpandex I'm like this about my cats. Pretty sure half of my old friends hate to hear about them and are only being polite.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-03 08:52:20	@Thunderrage @laureation Don't forget my Mum follows you as well. :P
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-03 09:09:02	@Thunderrage @laureation Good for me as well! *waggles eyebrows*
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-03 09:32:04	@citycyclists There should be a very basic requirement that to debate a topic, you have to prove awareness of the issues and situation.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-03 13:37:24	@FrogCroakley Get Mike Chang's six-pack-shortcut by killing and skinning him, then wearing him like a muscle-suit.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-03 14:47:36	@Thunderrage @laureation Is that mostly balding with a simple thin headband?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-03 14:51:13	@Thunderrage Yeah, pretty sure the proper name is a headband.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-03 16:30:16	Imagine if names were more than just verbal, but included somatic gestures as well.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-03 16:31:29	And yes, I'm aware that there exist languages entirely comprised of somatic gestures. I was thinking more for comedy with bad names.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-03 17:17:48	@daniel_barker The last two tweets together will do nicely.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-29 14:52:34	@jamiesmart Someone needs to invent an auto-record thing for phones, so you can play it back when you wake up.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-11-29 17:34:03	@jamiesmart There are mint-chocolate PRINGLES :O :O
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-04 08:47:11	@FrogCroakley Only if their power involves alternate timelines or is wholly unrelated to the war.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-04 09:22:13	@unfortunatalie Got anything you can spill on the coat you're sat on?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-05 07:55:08	Lovely colours in the sky on my ride this morning.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-05 08:36:06	Me: "I heard it was really horribly sexist", Dude in office: "But in a good way.", Me: "No. Just no. There is no good way." *rolleyes*
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-05 09:27:47	@Duds_2k DESTROYED. *implosion*
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-05 09:41:17	@Wangleberry Playing starbound?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-05 12:57:05	@GBCycleEmbassy But don't you see - they'll help us avoid/delay having to make drivers pay attention to cyclists. Next up, proximity sirens.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-05 13:06:46	@MrLloydSpandex You should wait in a "high-five" position until she needs you.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-05 14:46:04	@Brainmage It's already patched once. Patches likely to break saves entirely. Don't get too attached to characters. It is p.awesome though.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-05 14:47:12	@Brainmage This is way more story based. I have some tips. "E" is interact. Remember that. Use *everything*. Otherwise you might hit it.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-05 14:47:43	@Brainmage Also, shift works for fine-detail with mining / building. Rather than the 2x2 or 3x3 you can use shift for 1x1.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-05 15:31:22	@Brainmage @Wangleberry Awww, I'm sure if you have your heart set on it you can find some candles and shoes.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-04 11:04:20	@n0rm Is the presentation about secret messages?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-05 16:59:57	@jamiesmart I'm sure it'll be fine. Worst I can imagine is that SOMEONE HAS POISONED IT WHILE YOU WEREN'T LOOKING.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-05 17:04:27	@MrLloydSpandex If buses could chestbump as they passed each other I'm sure they would.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-04 16:11:47	@BethanyBlack or two friends, so one can hold you off the second.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-04 16:24:53	Oooo. My phone has a system update ready. Might be 4G now. #three http://t.co/XIPWu54E2b
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-04 16:25:06	Will know in a few mins when it downloads and updates.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 08:57:29	My colleague @BenPRJ in our other office found this mug. http://t.co/5wXCM1jaAO - I might have to buy it as well.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 08:58:30	@MrLloydSpandex Like one of those FBI tracker anklets? or like silly gold chain type?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 09:34:59	@thestorybeast Was that the one where they filmed all 28 seasons before airing so they could have actors playing old versions of themselves?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 09:43:29	@FrogCroakley You made me GIS "Elephant drinking wine" - this was amongst the results - http://t.co/onDmQjRZv9
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 11:17:15	@thestorybeast Pffft. The coolest kids were in the Tiny Trackers fanclub. She must've been a dum-dum-face.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 16:13:39	@thestorybeast I liked the one where the show "Time-Jumperz" said TimeTracker was just a rip-off show, but... #FanFicFriday
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 16:13:50	@thestorybeast How can it be a rip off if they were *actually* there doing their thing before the other show started! #FanFicFriday
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 16:41:53	@TheStoryBeast Do you remember that odd pair of episodes, the april fools one where he kept leaving bits of paper everywhere #FanFicFriday
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 16:41:59	@TheStoryBeast And then the one that aired on Fri 13th 2 seasons later where that guy kept getting paper cuts from everything. #FanFicFriday
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 16:42:54	@TheStoryBeast I laughed at the time, not getting the joke, but I still cringe thinking about the paper-cuts. Bad way to die #FanFicFriday
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 17:02:20	@Wangleberry That is magical
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 12:10:19	@thestorybeast My favourite villains were the time-portal-parkour-crew from Season 2. #FanFicFriday
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 12:10:27	@thestorybeast When SDR ( Stop, Drop 'N' Roll ) was perched on that crumbling burning roof, and Leapfrog #FanFicFriday
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 12:10:38	@thestorybeast parkour-portaled her way back in time to take a job in construction, to build a tallish building #FanFicFriday
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 12:10:45	@thestorybeast nearby to give SDR a solid landing base, I nearly cried. Sure, they ruined local economies #FanFicFriday
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 12:10:53	@thestorybeast and a few parks and kids schools were demolished, but they didn't deserve the bad rap they got. #FanFicFriday
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 15:31:32	@daniel_barker As a climber, I could write a book titled "Peaks: My Interest" #helping
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 16:13:44	@thestorybeast it turned out that the actual time-tracker characters were all actors in the background of the Jumperz pilot #FanFicFriday
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 16:15:33	@thestorybeast Though watching the equivalent TimeTracker episode was very enlightening for the behind-the-scenes on Jumperz #FanFicFriday
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-06 16:27:03	@majornelson sounds like missing functionality to me.

18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-10 17:14:00	@cyclegaz sounds too much like "effort" to non-cyclists.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-10 17:16:44	@jamesoff @nickmurison @n0rm Does it come in audiobook/podcast form?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-11 09:24:54	@laureation I've got some bah humbug baubles somewhere if you want.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-11 13:58:49	@laureation Correct! Here is your pigeon hole. Also a floofy dress to wear while you're in there.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-09 08:11:55	@RossLydall Poppycock. More blaming of those at risk? Well I suppose if you don't know what to do you go with what you do know.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-09 09:00:27	@NotRollergirl Do they recommend blanket-forts or pillow-forts?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-09 09:29:26	@daniel_barker Very well put.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-11 18:37:05	Omg. I won a twitter! ( @GAMEdigital )

18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-19 12:30:43	@CTC_Cyclists Is that a 3 year ban on driving once they're out? or a pointless ban while they're in jail?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-19 12:33:37	@EwaSR That voice changer is working out well then?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-19 12:33:56	@iamchaley @ctc_cyclists Thanks for the info :)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-19 15:52:05	@you_twits with? shots? or a firm "No". Or worse, a "No. And now we're watching you"
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-19 16:17:32	@GearboxSoftware App restricted in the UK? Why on earth would you do that.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-19 16:20:38	@GearboxSoftware For a phone app with nothing monetary related? What could be getting in your way? Do you have the APK available anywhere?:)
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-19 17:29:49	@Thunderrage @Brainmage Except the furminator is an actual thing for dealing with cat fur.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-20 08:28:19	@JoeWolfie Thanks! Works a treat.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-20 15:10:37	@Wangleberry photocopy a scowl and post it on the noticeboard.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-20 15:11:26	@Wangleberry Every morning when I get in an hour earlier than anyone else I have to resist replacing the sales whiteboard with OPTIMUS PRIME
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-20 15:11:53	@Wangleberry I don't think it'd go down well as they need all that data, but we have good red/blue markers!
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-23 11:15:26	@fox_sake That's what you get for sitting it on your shoulder.  Also lookit-dem-ears! :D
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-23 13:42:49	New facebook app wants to read and send text messages from my phone? I think No.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-23 14:50:52	@Brainmage It'd end up like those photos of people who have all just been scared by something to the right.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-23 14:52:39	@Brainmage Like this http://t.co/sivjSvRFTr

18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-23 16:37:21	Wonder if I can coast home by putting up a sail on my bike.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-24 10:39:54	@daniel_barker 2am, every 5 minutes I was woken up and checked my watch. For a whole hour. V disappointed in the weather.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-24 12:03:54	@fox_sake wrap it and leave it under the tree for the kitten to play with.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-25 17:31:42	My wife just pointed out that you can switch lyrics between the Muppets show and Ricky Martin's "she bangs". "She's in... To superstition.."
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-25 17:32:22	It works both ways as well. #aaaaaaaaaa
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-23 16:38:55	Nope - wind looks to be going in the wrong direction. Will be V tired when I get home I expect.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-23 17:09:29	Every cyclist should spend at least some of their time watching @cyclegaz 's Silly Cyclists http://t.co/stphgDJYjN for what not to do
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-23 17:10:02	Also on twitter on @sillycyclists - Very educational.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-23 17:12:36	@MrLloydSpandex Do that on purpose next time but make the shopping list really scary.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-23 17:16:36	@MrLloydSpandex *Hacksaw.  *Bonesaw??  *Bleach.  *Spade.  *That roll plastic stuff.  *Bin Bags.  *Rat Poison.  *Pot Noodle.  *PG Tips.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-23 17:17:59	@MrLloydSpandex With some of them neatly crossed through ofc.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-30 07:48:08	Wheeling bike towards front door, notice puncture. Le sigh.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-27 09:00:29	I'm the only one in the office.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-27 09:00:40	I don't move much.  The lights keep switching off thinking no-one is here.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-27 10:26:15	@psweetman Do you know when you'll be in Paddington tomorrow yet?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-27 11:25:41	@4ChordsNoNet Big fan of their hella fancy giant egyptian cotton towels. Especially nice after riding in the rain.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-27 11:26:29	@4ChordsNoNet The bath sheets (biggest) are £24 each. http://t.co/nKXkEMG2lm
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-27 11:45:02	Absolutely hate .srt files which were generated using OCR.  Capital-I != Lowercase L.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-27 12:46:14	Looking at speakers / AV gear and wincing at the price of everything I want.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-27 13:11:47	The chiller salad cabinet in Sainsbury's is entirely full of boxes of celebrations.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-30 09:54:19	@rocket_panda Lacie did this all the time as well. Power units always failing. Fortunately I discovered where their london office was.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-30 09:54:35	@rocket_panda used to amble over every 3 months to swap it out for a new one. Riduculous though.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-30 12:07:40	@daniel_barker For wearing during? or depositing into?
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-27 14:51:41	Superdry keeps trying to get our wholly non-related website taken offline entirely, claiming trademark infringement. We're a money website.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-30 14:05:14	@n0rm Be thankful you're not trying to opt out of the text message service :D
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-30 16:15:07	@Wangleberry Lol - why are they blaming Tesco?  Not like they can control drivers
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-30 16:34:55	Also good reading re: that last retweet is the detail from @totkat re: weight loss through to ironman in the top right.
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-30 20:30:08	@Duds_2k @totkat harder, perhaps, but not impossible. Mmmm butter
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-27 22:24:53	@psweetman we'll aim for eleven to half eleven. Laura hasn't been feeling well tonight so it may just be me. See you tomorrow!
18186373	dmatryx	2013-12-31 22:29:32	My wife is dunking fancy biscuits into red wine. #HAPPYNEWYEAR 
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-02 09:44:27	@jonanamary Probably projection. Maybe GW can't comprehend doing those things for anything other than manipulation purposes?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-02 09:50:35	@jonanamary Not everyone sees the same. Quite a lot of people see calling out as an attempt to cause embarrasment due to how public it is.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-02 15:00:21	@BrianTotteridge @BorisWatch @RossLydall What do pavements / pavement cycling have to do with cylists killed by motorist collisions?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-02 15:11:05	@RKWinvisibleman @BrianTotteridge I won't equate to the scale danger of racism, but the mentality behind this behaviour is exactly the same.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-02 15:11:52	@RKWinvisibleman @BrianTotteridge Blaming all of a group for actions of some, and refusing equal legal protection unless they *all* conform?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-02 15:14:06	@RKWinvisibleman Great article by the way. Very good read, especially about the account with the intimidating driver.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-03 09:07:44	@HayleyHeartbrk H.M.S Fon-doom
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-03 10:24:59	@nickmurison How quickly do you think it will freeze over in damp british winter weather? I predict cascading bikes onto train tracks.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-03 10:25:36	@jacs1984 *disagree*
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-03 10:26:24	@jacs1984 I like that one because I have stupid sunbeam face
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-03 14:43:36	@jamiesmart or a well planned murder in progress using clear plastic.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-03 16:26:37	@CyclingMikey @tymynyddfarm @theJeremyVine And if through bad driving you have to choose btwn a cyclist or an island, drive into the island
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 08:33:58	@Wangleberry Put up posters of the outside world?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 09:23:18	@cyclegaz I'm seeing all the tweets this morning about trains etc being back to mega busy and, though damp, chuckling to myself.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 10:37:13	@Brainmage What sort of game? Board / Card / Deckbuilding?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 10:39:58	@Brainmage I'm sure @thunderrage will also be up for playtesting, but I'm up for helping playtest most things.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 10:40:51	@GreenJennyJones More depressing is how few were actually taken off the road!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 10:41:12	@Brainmage Dibs on being that goon's boss.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 11:13:21	@Wangleberry Best advice I have, find someone else nearby who has cats and offer to do the same for them in return.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 13:30:45	Go and do a google image search for bean toes before you do any more work this afternoon.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 13:32:02	@dwylth http://t.co/sWVuWcqmtr Also expression.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 13:47:37	@kiell I cannot believe what I just watched.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 14:12:06	@jamiesmart and earlier "Never base your life decisions on advice from people who don't have to deal with the results of your decisions"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 14:12:41	@jamiesmart So they're basically saying "Ignore everything we say. (including this message to ignore everything we say)"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 16:20:18	@mangmangmang That's how they're all in fashion. There can only be one single fashion at any one time. I'm waiting for 'weird' to come back.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-07 08:39:09	@Wangleberry Jokes on you. They're using @thestorybeast as the model every single week.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 16:54:40	@Brainmage Advert for brighton beach? mumble mumble met someone called sandy something something shingles.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 17:03:05	@mangmangmang literally genuinely upset.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 17:08:46	oh god I'm now being followed by "Corp Management" @CorpManagement ( cc @brainmage @FrogCroakley )
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 17:29:23	@jamiesmart I thought it was short/slang for "moving pictures".
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-06 17:45:55	@nw_nicholas Not defending targetting priorities at all, but this is likely an effect of #staff by quantity of cases versus value of cases.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-07 14:52:51	@RKWinvisibleman Cripes. What do you wear in those sorts of conditions?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-07 17:09:18	@MrLloydSpandex Usually. I'm short sighted, so it adds a soft-focus to everything and keeps just important bits in focus. i.e. the sexings.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-08 10:03:10	@Wangleberry sounds like he assumes all women are touchy and also assumes they're paranoid about sexism. I'd be cross in a similar situation
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-08 10:07:02	@hobofood in comments? tough one. I wouldn't bother. I'd try to fold in with actual patches.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-08 10:28:05	@hobofood @cja_ Good work. Helps maintainability at the very least.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-08 10:31:03	@hobofood @cja_ If they reject a patch with no downsides and no effective changes except comments like this, their ego must be a big problem
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-08 12:07:45	Really getting tired of being asked for updates on stagnated projects outside of my control / workload.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-08 12:42:49	@4ChordsNoNet @cyclegaz @bollocksinfra So it's at the end of a shared use segment saying from that point you have to now use the cycle lane?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-08 12:43:22	@4ChordsNoNet @cyclegaz @bollocksinfra Would be nice to have a way to merge with the lane then rather than just drop off the edge.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-08 15:08:24	Machine that prints chocolate? http://t.co/mapYTXYevC Wonder if I can sneak one onto expenses.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-09 08:56:45	@n0rm I like my wine too much, the rest is not bad though :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-09 08:56:54	@n0rm baby steps though right?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-08 21:15:18	Now she's trying to feed me millionaires shortbread (vegan) by going "Open the hatch! Delta flyer is coming in!" I'm having none of it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-09 09:34:41	@NotRollergirl Marry, Shag, Kill.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-09 09:35:59	@NotRollergirl Yeah, I flip-flopped a lot, but I figured in the end I'd be more interested living a life with Ron than Jack.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-09 09:38:36	@NotRollergirl Living with Jack would be more money than sense but I'm not sure you'd feel appreciated. Ron falls hard when he falls in love
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-09 09:44:19	@unfortunatalie Same. I have no idea how much a cheap haircut or expensive one would be, or styling etc. Or what you should expect for £££!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-09 09:46:10	@daniel_barker oh bravo.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-09 08:14:53	@Wangleberry Thanks - missed them the first time round.  What's the course like?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-09 09:53:02	@unfortunatalie fuuuuuuuuuuck. I dye / cut myself and I think the cost of my bleach/dye is bad enough (about £15-£20 every 8-12 weeks)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-09 09:53:35	@unfortunatalie slightly less if I'm sticking to the same colour as I don't need as much bleach. but wow. £80? *boggle*
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-09 16:05:56	@daniel_barker or aiming really low with something like "It's raining."
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-10 09:00:17	.@Laureation Reckon we can scrounge up enough money to buy http://t.co/HGhIQ7Y1Jv :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-10 09:40:04	@Wangleberry creepypasta? What is that?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-10 10:23:49	Hey @Strava Would like the ability to star leaderboard layouts.E.g this segment for the month. Or this segment for my following for all time
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-10 15:21:24	Finally figured out what this song that has been stuck in my head is. Only been about 5 weeks now or torment. ( Portishead - Roads )
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-09 16:09:57	@daniel_barker "It's raining" carries no context really. I wouldn't care if they thought it was observation or complaint. Aiming low!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-09 16:10:28	@daniel_barker I disagree with that whole 90% thing, but if you aim low enough you can convey really simple concepts. "I'm cold" etc
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-09 16:33:32	@EwaSR so buy 2015's diary now?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-10 08:56:43	@ppiixx Want. Want sooooooo bad.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-10 16:58:19	Goon designed cycling garb. http://t.co/zwTokQNcaE Beautiful.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-10 10:24:14	.@Strava It would go nicely as a new tab alongside My Segments and My Routes.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-10 08:52:42	@4ChordsNoNet Obviously gave your muscles a good rest then!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-10 09:30:08	.@Laureation Can we buy/make this for Aurie? :D MT: @LiberalDespot: Segmented Cat Armour! http://t.co/zx6vPRyCTE
#cat #armour
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-10 12:03:23	@cyclegaz Some people just click yes to anything, even when working on someone else's machine.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-10 13:28:49	@GreenJennyJones Funny how when an incident involves the police being injured they go for attempted murder, but never for #cyclist injuries.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-10 14:36:57	@Wangleberry Turn those knobs! PUSH THE LEVERS!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-10 15:03:37	@BBCMarkSimpson I strongly recommend the CycleConfident courses http://t.co/dFLNwYVy8F Subsidised by most boroughs. V good for new cyclists.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-10 15:21:30	I'm bad with music. Shut up.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-13 08:49:43	@Brainmage All of the above, at once.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-13 10:21:46	@CTC_Cyclists How on earth can the driver keep blaming the cyclist in those quotes. Unbelievable.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-13 11:02:30	@unfortunatalie I've seen ALL of it. Except the most recent episode. Season 4 has been a let down so far tbh.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-13 12:22:59	Colleague linked me to http://t.co/SwpfMaXU05 - a Tumblr of computer source code used in TV and films and what they really are.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-13 12:25:49	@Brainmage In order best-&gt;worst. Bottom left, bottom right, top left, top right.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-13 14:36:46	@xerode kids basically. Kids.  Those harmless little spooky kids have grown up and broken everything.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-13 14:39:07	@xerode Yeah, this is particularly bad.  From 2009 as well. Quite glad I've not come across it till now. p.s. "thanks"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-13 14:44:44	@xerode You know I've never really bothered to look up videos for stuff like this, just pulled an Assemblage 23 video http://t.co/z0woi4Bh6x
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-13 14:46:02	@xerode Starting to think there's some sort of "Dance like a cybergoth" school / training lessons or something I missed out on.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-13 14:46:40	@xerode Mind you, I sort of sidled into the EBM scene from the industrial scene via Icon of Coil etc.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-13 14:48:07	@xerode Found it.  Here's the source material for all of the videos. http://t.co/88lpVCid5B
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-14 09:23:33	@spokey_doke I feel drunk just looking at that.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-14 09:32:52	@CroydonCyclists How can the head teacher dictate what kids do outside of school? Surely they're outside school responsibility. (@veloevol )
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-14 11:25:36	@unfortunatalie Clippy (and actual paperclips actually) is so dated. They'll probably try and modernise it with a hash-symbol with eyeballs.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-14 12:03:56	@jimkillock He'll probably just get a £50 fine and 3 points.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-14 12:24:35	@WINDY_BUTT Email her with a link to that tweet.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-14 13:39:52	@nickovdw What a shitheel.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-14 13:41:03	@ThePCCLondon Do you could the Titan A.E. film? It is part CGI, but still mostly animated.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-15 10:40:40	@stoviesfortea Android app doesn't appear to exist yet btw. Coming sometime in 2014.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-15 10:51:48	@stoviesfortea Shame, because I'm a droid user, but the website works well regardless :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-17 09:12:17	@Brainmage Oh, did you not mean RT this?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-17 09:44:29	@daniel_barker Why would you row through a hedge? it's not even liquid.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-17 13:42:28	@beztweets I think you have to have the route planned already, then add more points *after*. Let me take a look quickly.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-17 13:43:36	@beztweets Nope - not that. Er, I don't know then. I use the bikehub app on my droid and you can add more destinations in that. Same system.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-16 08:11:35	Guess who forgot pants today. It's me!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-16 08:20:53	@Thunderrage Surely you're aware that I'm not American?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-15 14:19:22	@beztweets Get the bikehub app for android :) You can route plan from both / retrieve on droid from web planned if you wish. Voice cues too
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-17 17:07:57	@EwaSR Refuse, because they'll probably suffocate inside it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-16 15:04:50	I would like something, that I can sneak into my colleague's spotify, that would stop them playing the same song more than once a week.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-16 15:08:04	@CTC_Cyclists Just over a month and it'll be light during my cycle commutes!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-16 16:04:36	@CyclingMikey What do you think of this sort of idea for drilling home speed limits? http://t.co/BDelUpRsWC
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-16 16:12:59	@ThatSillyGinge Thanks for the link. Saves me doing my own research! :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-16 16:16:17	@lastwheel Much like racing between speed humps I guess.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-16 16:20:19	@lastwheel I can imagine people *asking* for speed limiters to be fitted if that was the case.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-16 16:21:49	@lastwheel You would be doing them a favour to lose their keys occasionally. :/
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-16 16:28:33	@lastwheel Yeah, or vehicles not completely enclosed getting smashed by a wall of water.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-16 16:35:52	@citycyclists I don't get why it isn't enforced. It is against the law isn't it?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-16 16:39:41	@citycyclists Thanks for the clarification :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-15 17:09:19	@CyclingMikey Wish I could say me, but even along my route of mostly back-streets I get the occasional yell from a passing window.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-15 17:10:14	@CyclingMikey Idea - psychiatric testing to keep your driving licence. Shouting abuse =&gt; Trigger for compulsary re-assessment for rage probs
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-15 17:10:45	@CyclingMikey Perhaps a bit too extreme, but if you're prone to rage you shouldn't be handling heavy machinery at high speed!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-20 15:23:37	@victohenry Saddest pug I ever saw.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-21 09:10:28	@BugsMcgee Tradition says to wrap yourself in duvet with a big bowl of soup and either a good book / TV / DVDs / Laptop + Internet
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-21 09:12:02	@BugsMcgee If you're not used to daytime TV beware - you're not as ill as you think - it really is like peering through the looking glass.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-21 12:40:46	@beztweets If I ever have the desire to kill someone and get away with it, Step 1 will be a driver's license.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-21 14:34:53	@AsEasyAsRiding Gonna put mine on now at my desk, just to be safe.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-21 14:41:39	@AsEasyAsRiding To be fair - it doesn't say what they're a legal requirement for. Not even specifically cycling. Perhaps it's scuba-diving?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-21 17:30:43	@citycyclists I notice that this bridge specifically prohibits cycling as well.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-22 08:36:56	@AsEasyAsRiding So it doesn't get in the way of the oh so important traffic throughput.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-22 11:09:29	@cyclegaz Just watched the video. Is her "satnav" just google maps on a phone? Because that's not really a satnav now is it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-22 11:37:20	The Italian place I like going to for lunch occasionally just phoned to tell me they're doing my favourite today :9 Mmm Pasqualina.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-22 11:37:50	Also - great service! I mean, calling to let you know your favourite is on the menu today. #awesome
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-22 11:41:33	@Neris_k It is the Ludgate Circus branch of http://t.co/CVFydknVNX :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-22 11:43:00	@Neris_k The focaccia from there is also excellent.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-22 11:51:29	@dunos I had missed out on it last week. They had it every day I wasn't in, so they offered to call me when they had it in next :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-22 14:25:48	@thestorybeast You'll like this http://t.co/QBeXIEpYRJ
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-22 17:07:25	@ColenMcA Yes. They also then get periodic reminders about it even if they've left!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-22 16:32:31	@Brockway_LLC I hate this so much.  Reminds me of watching 5-year olds playing sports. *chases the ball into the net*
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-27 14:09:38	@laureation So Beetroot, Broccoli, Cabbage and Mushrooms. :9
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-27 10:47:16	@AsEasyAsRiding An army? Really?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-28 14:41:48	@unfortunatalie Is there an equally bad followup "21 weird things guys think girls do when they're alone together?"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-28 14:43:40	@CyclingMikey Shame videos taken down just have that generic message, and you can't put your own Takedown message on it saying why removed.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-28 14:45:44	@CyclingMikey I agree on both counts, I meant for the benefit of people following old links / forum posts etc.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-28 14:47:19	@beztweets oh god what? Really?  Next up, pedestrians will need helmets I assume?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-28 14:48:12	@JeffSpeckAICP Looks like some enterprising person has very carefully moved every letter one space left.  Neat and careful work though.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-28 14:48:36	@JeffSpeckAICP V.Unlikely to be accident because why would you put letters up right-to-left?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-28 16:42:23	@Neris_k Hah. V true.  I actually quite like the minimalist look now. More like something *I* would wear really.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-29 13:40:47	@dunos LEGO even have a FAQ thing about "please stop diluting our brand by using the term LEGOs" somewhere.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-29 15:05:11	@beztweets I want to know how you can hit someone with enough force to slam your mirror against your vehicle, and claim to be driving slowly
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-29 16:11:05	@beztweets I guess the next logical step may be pre-emptive tech for bikes. Scanners computing trajectory of nearby vehicles, audible alarms
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-29 16:11:45	@beztweets At least you might get enough momentary warning to try and stay alive.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-29 16:16:22	@MushroomgodMat @beztweets As a pedestrian I wouldn't fare much better if I stopped cycling.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-29 16:18:47	@MushroomgodMat Probably not. Even if he was a pedestrian with high viz and wearing LEDs. :/
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-31 08:14:01	@cyclegaz Cycle in, train home (with bike) off-peak.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-31 08:16:33	@cyclegaz Ah. Well big thumbs up from me for not cycling after drinking.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-31 08:57:46	@EwaSR Yes - they both have roots in the greek word Naus for ship. Nautical =via Nautes/Nautikos (sailor). Nausea =via Nausia (seasickness)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-31 08:59:35	@CycleComm I started cycling 6 months ago as a way to save money. Have more than paid for my whole bike + gear now.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-31 09:17:07	@CycleComm I have to keep reminding myself that every month, I've effectively saved £130 which I can now spend on lovely merino tops etc.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-31 13:04:34	Hey @Laureation - http://t.co/Cxv1NzaQhO Fan reboot potential? Trailer looks to have more budget than entire original film did.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-31 13:53:56	@wigglebikeshop ~1650 by my estimation. Perspective is tricky with that one though. #competition
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-31 13:55:45	@wigglebikeshop Er, are you including the downstairs part of that aisle?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-31 13:57:37	@wigglebikeshop Because if not, I think 800 is a better estimate!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-31 15:29:23	@CyclingMikey @veloevol @JamesNonchalant Scream-powered-horn.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-30 09:16:43	@magnatom That van driver did (unbelievably given description of the impact slamming the mirror) claim he was driving slowly.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-30 09:18:15	@magnatom :( I dread to think what he would have considered fast.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-30 09:45:19	@n0rm wow. very coffee. so morning. sleepy. wow so tired. much hangover.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-30 10:39:29	@beztweets With no way to detail how the electricity is generated, that may not be accurate either. Turbines / Bike+Dynamo for example.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-01-30 10:39:55	@beztweets Devil's advocate of course, arguably even the bike+dynamo costs emissions to fashion.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-03 08:56:54	@akaikitsunechan &lt;3 Glad you've gotten control back.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-03 09:53:25	@Duds_2k @alz Heavy freezing fog might even allow people to do &gt;78mph if visibility is low enough.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-03 09:54:00	@dunos @alz I can justify it by seeing a lot of really terrible driving and people being unaware of their own stopping distances.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-03 09:54:35	@dunos @alz If everyone was a sensible driver for their speed, I'd have no problem. But people are idiots.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-03 09:55:34	@dunos @alz They do however tend to reduce speeds which in turn reduces the damage that can be caused from a crash.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-03 09:56:17	@dunos @alz Of course, they won't do anything to stop people that just don't give a crap about any tickets/penalties/enforcement/etc
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-03 10:00:26	@laureation &lt;Aurie&gt; I'm going with you this time!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-03 10:10:23	@GAMEdigital Not gaming, but I did force myself to watch the last 2 seasons of Misfits. First 3 seasons were good. 4/5 Were so so terrible.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-03 10:30:13	@jamesoff @dunos @alz I think that's why there's more push for average speed cameras versus flat speed cameras.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-03 12:56:15	@charlotteyoung They only work 1-2 days per week.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-03 13:23:37	@4ChordsNoNet I've said it before and I'm sure I'll say it again, it should be against the law to fail to prosecute an offense with evidence
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 08:36:46	New pillows last night. Like drowning in floof all night.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 09:19:37	@markbikeslondon Someone could do with editing those routes into their own layers on the map.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 09:21:01	@markbikeslondon Yeah, I just tried to add a layer and it says I don't have permission to do so!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 09:24:55	Re: That last retweet. I'm planning on leading rides from East Dulwich/Peckham Rye up to Blackfriars. Mostly via back roads. #BikeTheStrike!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 09:46:22	@markbikeslondon I've added an early route from E.Dulwich/Peckham Rye -&gt; Blackfriars (North) which I'll run on Weds/Thurs/Fri.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 09:48:03	@markbikeslondon Though admittedly it isn't really along tube routes, if it helps anyone on their bike I'm all for it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 10:00:33	@markbikeslondon You may be able to fix the layer issue by changing the sharing settings?Or just add a whole range of blank layers for peeps
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 10:00:58	@markbikeslondon It is reportedly quite problematic though so *shrug*
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 10:10:11	@markbikeslondon Did some reading, basically layers are just ruined in total so probably best to just have everything under one layer anyway
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 10:10:37	@markbikeslondon see Treebles second reply https://t.co/pXlmhFv8B0
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 10:12:25	@markbikeslondon I'll re-add my route to the main layer in a while, and clean out the second layer.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 10:54:09	@markbikeslondon There we go, moved it over into the same layer as everything else.  Well, by "moved" I mean re-created from scratch.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 11:11:41	@FrogCroakley @Wangleberry @dwylth @xerode @mimtron @misterspidergod Totally bandwaggoning.  :thumbsup:
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 11:14:30	@dwylth @FrogCroakley @Wangleberry @xerode @mimtron @misterspidergod Hopefully not quite "blood on the game dice" seriously.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 11:15:44	@dwylth @FrogCroakley @Wangleberry @xerode @mimtron @misterspidergod Excellent. Serious RPGing is cool. Getting butthurt over games is not.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 11:22:59	@Wangleberry @FrogCroakley @xerode @dwylth @mimtron @misterspidergod Why look for a more elegant solution when you can just hit stuff.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 11:27:09	@tweetymike I just had a quick read on that, but a new Pro is actually not correct. Moving weight forwards makes braking less effective.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-03 17:05:40	SoundCloud ran out of my actual playlist, and put on things it thought I'd like after that. Thanks SoundCloud. Maniacs of Noise is great. :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 11:27:49	@tweetymike The repositioned weight makes it more likely to rotate around the front wheel over the HB in the event of sharp deceleration.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 11:30:35	@tweetymike I'm not sure I would agree with approaching traffic being courteous either. Usually the more dangerous drivers are following you
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 11:31:18	@tweetymike With a visible rear child seat, you're less likely to get punishment passes and the like, which put your child in danger.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 11:32:23	@tweetymike Interesting writing though, but lots of points there really worth debating and the language on both sides needs to be unweighted
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 11:46:18	@cyclegaz If you're hooking events, also look up event.preventDefault();  You might find it's more useful in some cases.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 11:54:32	@Wangleberry @FrogCroakley @mimtron @xerode @dwylth @misterspidergod I am interested in taking part too if there's room.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 12:59:19	@markbikeslondon Do you think we should remove that Old Street to Canary Wharf collection?  The 6 different parts don't connect up.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 13:00:05	@markbikeslondon Also considering removing the end point markers, since they're redundant. What do you think?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 13:08:25	@markbikeslondon I've added an instructions thing and moved it to the top of the list, hopefully will help reduce random segments.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 13:13:03	@tweetymike I meant more in terms of, if it's going to affect anyone in that way, it'll be people about to maneuver around you.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 13:15:41	@tweetymike Sadly, just normal commuting around London usually.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 13:20:38	@tweetymike #sadface :)  I see a couple of child-bike-seats along my commute. All rear mounted, and use the extra space for reflectors+++.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 18:48:10	If you're coming on the 7am E.Dulwich/P.Rye -&gt; Blackfriars #BikeTheStrike route and want to make sure I wait for you be sure to tweet at me!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-04 18:53:49	Down to the last 4 episodes of Star Trek: Voyager now. After that, @laureation and I are moving into Quantum Leap #ohboy
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-05 12:13:10	Going to buy a tool which will tell me the % my chain is longer than norm due to wear. I think this point makes me feel like a real cyclist.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-05 12:40:08	@spamvicious use citymapper and just use the bus only routes.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-05 12:40:30	@spamvicious If you don't have the smartphone app - http://t.co/Mo4SZW7jtH

18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-05 14:52:26	@daniel_barker Out of 100.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-05 17:07:47	@CTC_Cyclists Hoping I win! :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-06 11:44:15	@archclimbing The Arch Monthly Riddle : UNSOLVABLE!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-05 08:45:12	What strike? #Cycling
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-05 09:04:54	@nirav999 I'm sure loads of people are already jumping on you, but 'road tax' doesn't exist. It's an emissions tax you pay.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-05 09:05:41	@nirav999 road maintenance fund comes out of general taxation, so if the cyclist (who is normally also driver btw) pays tax they contribute.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-05 09:05:59	@nirav999 Awesome :) :thumbup:
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-05 11:40:30	@4ChordsNoNet Send that letter to the evening standard. I'm sure they'll have a field day with it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-05 11:41:22	@4ChordsNoNet Or at least @RossLydall
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-06 14:19:13	@nickovdw is the reason "CHA-CHING!"?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-06 14:19:45	@ThePCCLondon I think my favourite is the one where BATMAN.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-05 15:35:48	Hey @CTC_Cyclists - @lb_southwark looking for ideas to transform Southwark's high streets http://t.co/iRpRYA8dmQ I'm sure you have ideas!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-05 17:25:09	@darkrock Real shame it was cancelled after 2 seasons :/
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-05 17:41:32	@n0rm grats :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-06 08:09:27	@darkrock It is really REALLY good. No more slapstick. Much darker and flows better.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-06 08:12:32	Re: that last RT. "Good job" impatient drivers. If you all followed the rules and only moved on when you had space that wouldn't happen.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-06 08:14:12	Really lovely sunrise coming over Blackfriars bridge this morning. Of course I was busy riding so I couldn't take a photo, but it was amaze.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 08:20:35	@wingerden_cross Have been thoroughly enjoying your LPs of Inversion and Timeshift.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 08:22:56	@n0rm My Mrs is soon to be moving offices to along my route to work. Am considering a little side-car for my bicycle. Like classic batman.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 09:19:06	@n0rm When you get a chance to use it for a while, let me know how visible it is in different light conditions.  I really liked the idea....
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 09:19:40	@n0rm but conceptually it seemed to me to fail to protect against drivers who just aren't looking in the first place.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 10:46:41	Excellent service from @winstanleysBike  Ordered a muc-off 8 in 1 cleaning kit for just 2/3 price of anywhere local, free next day delivery.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 10:48:21	Half expected it to turn up as the wrong item for that price, but nope. All correct, amazingly fast given I ordered yesterday lunch.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 11:17:34	@CyclingMikey There's some joke in there somewhere about getting a ride or something, but #effort
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 12:06:54	@dwylth What time are you getting to the Brewdog btw?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 12:53:58	My phone has started to connect to 4G just outside the office.  16.58Mbps down, 10.95 up.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 13:33:55	Asshole on the desk next to me eating stinky tuna fish despite knowing it would make me sick.  Had to leave the room.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 13:34:59	Next time I'll just bear it until I upchuck over him to teach him a lesson in manners.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 13:42:42	@jamesoff inside my office, and just down the road, I'm back to H / 3G - but that sweet spot is good for all of the intertubes
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 13:47:44	@wingerden_cross You should consider trying to come to one of the london goon meets if you haven't already. I don't recall seeing you.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 14:52:42	@AsEasyAsRiding "The lanes will be wide enough...to overtake a cyclist .... " Overtaking cyclists... on a *roundabout*. Are they **NUTS**
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 14:53:52	@AsEasyAsRiding I should be more clear.They're talking about *in the same lane* not inner lane of the roundabout going faster and turning.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 15:00:01	@AsEasyAsRiding Do they just think "Oh, it's a dutch design. Must automatically be for acceptable for bikes then."
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-10 10:48:35	@VivaVHS @Thunderrage Sho'nuff!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-10 13:28:02	Thanks to my colleague @BenPRJ for linking me to http://t.co/HXK1kfMCnz - Pretty much everything here is applicable for our codebase.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-07 15:25:35	@Brainmage Quick Guy! Try to sell some wire on twitter ( @MrLloydSpandex )
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-08 11:09:34	@SockToi AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa... *splat* (me doing the same)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-08 16:03:00	@nickmurison there is! So indulgent.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-12 07:41:46	Just called an ambulance to deal with an incident between a vehicle and a person on a bike on Willow Walk. Where's our #spaceforcycling?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-12 07:43:31	Top marks to emergency services who were there in just over five minutes.  As I left the rider looked like he will be ok.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-12 10:26:10	@dunos Elgin probably
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-12 14:10:19	@alz I'm good with regex - If you need some help feel free to prod in my direction.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-11 08:37:40	@n0rm Chillstep - http://t.co/qK55yzmrZ8  Start from like the 4th track - or at least just skip the first, it's not great. The rest are tho.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-11 10:09:55	@Wangleberry Chi-Man. Riding a great big spirit dragon.  We just circle the heavens contemplating how humanity is beyond all help.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-11 12:51:13	@shouldbeinbed @beztweets Would it have been avoided by the driver slowing down? We'll never know for sure but IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE HELPED
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-11 14:18:18	@Ed_Miliband Can't believe you have so little respect for local MPs you can't even wait 15 seconds for them to finish before interrupting.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-11 14:18:49	@Ed_Miliband Watch yourself here - https://t.co/ZEREFNkM07 - I hope you feel absolutely ashamed. Dismissive and rude.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-11 16:52:10	@nickmurison Reminded myself to dig this out.
http://t.co/kUJcqLaAQz
Bike Cafe. One of the services they do is an £8 valet &amp; oil service
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-10 08:11:48	Fitted new chain over the weekend.  I *strongly* recommend latex gloves for anyone going to attempt the same. Glad I had them.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-10 09:19:08	@citycyclists it's the contained environment I guess?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-10 10:19:59	Quantum Leap now. Every episode is so heavy/serious issues @laureation and I are watching CSI for something lighter hearted to break it up.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-10 10:20:19	Quantum Leap also does wonders to remind you that everyone is terrible.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-10 10:23:47	@VivaVHS omg. You're showing The Last Dragon? ( cc @thunderrage )
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-13 10:24:31	@laureation What's their last name? Can you turn it into something stupid?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-13 14:11:00	What's that you say? 90s saxophanist superhero with a laser eye and the ability to sense evil? Called "Night Man" http://t.co/CzU4AefceC
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-13 14:11:33	First 2 mins of this is the intro and trailer for Night Man http://t.co/fvjvQDcOYl - I *need* to see this show.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-13 14:13:53	@Wangleberry Same way as normal. It's muscle constriction pushing things, not gravity doing the work. Much the same as swallowing. (I think)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-13 14:18:33	@Wangleberry Oh right, septic tank perhaps?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-13 14:19:37	@Wangleberry if it were up to me, the "flush" would just aim it at the atmosphere and let it be free.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-13 14:24:13	@Wangleberry I'm not sure this particular moment in my history is one to be proud of.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-13 14:47:31	@cyclegaz What are they? I mean, I can see they're LED strips, but are they a product or something home-brew?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-13 14:49:55	@cyclegaz I'd be very interested to see one of your cycle-past back and forth videos like you did for the blaze light.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-13 15:52:40	@beztweets - Like you I'm constantly disappointed by sentencing in cases involving (cyclists) death. I just found http://t.co/eqjd4vkqGV
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-13 15:52:55	@beztweets Check the manslaughter one and prepare to be disappointed again.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-13 15:58:06	@beztweets Some of the reasoning when you pick the "wrong" answer is just, ugh. You'll see.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-14 09:34:50	@n0rm dressing gown and slippers++
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-14 11:14:38	@beztweets I dread to think how they might respond if asked what an acceptable amount of time to not be looking at the road is, at speed.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-14 11:32:04	@citycyclists or tongue in cheek "Welcome to Lambeth, leave your bikes at the door".
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-14 17:19:11	@laureation Reminds me of that guy who started talking at me when we were with your parents or somit? I don't take the bus now. #coincidence
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-14 13:33:39	@FrogCroakley is "GoldenLager" too obvious / a real thing?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-14 13:35:23	@FrogCroakley Works for everything. Lager another day. The Lager is not enough.  Octo-Lager (D.Craig's fave 8% get smashed dead quick brand)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-14 13:56:25	.@thebrainofchris @FrogCroakley License to lager: Bond decides to cut the middleman and opens a bar. Goes bankrupt from drinking all profits
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-14 13:57:33	I have 5% scotch whisky popcorn on my desk.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 17:22:53	@victohenry @UpThatRock You could always send a DMCA takedown notice to their webhosts
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 17:32:21	@UpThatRock On photos, you can go to Options, then Report ( / remove tag ) - then there's a link in the lower left of that window...
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 17:32:44	@UpThatRock to report that it's a copyright infringement.  I've never had need to do that so can't speak beyond that point really.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 17:32:54	@UpThatRock But it does look like there are provisions for it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-19 12:00:47	@jayforeman A bag. :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-19 12:37:33	@FrogCroakley Are you still doing these? I think I saw you doing requests the other day?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-19 12:46:23	@FrogCroakley Well when you do your next batch, Adam West Batman on a bicycle. Like, a penny farthing, or a tiny clown bicycle or something?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-19 12:46:56	@FrogCroakley and I will love you forever and ever and ever. Or at least use it as my twitter avatar.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-17 09:50:51	@4ChordsNoNet Double M because you're using "cam" as a verb in this case.  e.g. Run -&gt; Runner.  Cam -&gt; Cammer.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-19 15:29:34	@iamannaisabel and they didn't rush you a valentines card?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-19 16:04:06	@beztweets I guess blue isn't testing as well with the public since people keep dying on it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-17 13:59:02	@unfortunatalie I've come across some victorian electrocution devices with genital attachments. Like, light shocking, not like death.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-17 17:16:28	@cr3 @4ChordsNoNet Perhaps also ask to view the programme before it airs to give approval for how they use it in case anti-cyclist slant?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 09:06:50	@white_mischief Contact twitter support. give them the dates and details, they may be able to just mass-remove them all?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 09:13:06	@white_mischief I've not had the need for anything like this.  Just the nerd in me assuming they'll have analysis for this sort of thing.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 09:14:23	@white_mischief Oh, check your "authorised applications" stuff as well, make sure nothing unexpected has been added.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 09:40:43	@white_mischief Their support twitter account is @support - alternatively https://t.co/IO4oj7klXx and bottom link on the left side.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 09:43:01	@white_mischief What a useful support "form" - yeah, tweet em I guess.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 09:43:42	@beztweets Just read your response to http://t.co/s1SaEgnjuX the thick dashes should never be crossed. Supposed to be raised "soft" barriers
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 09:44:14	@beztweets Going Union-&gt;Tavistock follows inner lane all the way to the north point where that arrow splits, then round  on the outer lane
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 09:44:37	@beztweets For cars, it's actually fast and efficient. You decide where you're going before you get there, and don't change lanes at all
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 09:44:50	@beztweets However, for bikes it's a terrible terrible idea as everyone is quite rightly pointing out.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 09:46:39	@beztweets you're quite right that the direction arrows are inconsistent. For "straight on" - sometimes it's the left lane, sometimes right
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 09:46:52	@beztweets but in theory that should be fine if the signage before junction is accurate.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 09:48:53	@beztweets Nah, you only have to pass the line markings rather than the dividers. Gimme a min, I'll doodle over this and upload it somewhere
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 09:50:57	@beztweets http://t.co/yrD2NS6DLI  Forgive very very rough drawing.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 09:52:01	@beztweets Mmmm - It appears to force people to change lanes one junction earlier than they would on a normal roundabout.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 09:52:19	@beztweets Well, in my experience of people changing lanes only as they actually exit a roundabout anyway.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 10:05:08	@scsmith4 @sallyhinch This is the best idea.  Or trapdoors that return after catching the car in a pit.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 10:50:11	@jamesoff If it's anything like the speaker/microphone from my old electronics set it could work. Mmm piezo electric crystals.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 11:45:45	@beztweets It doesn't appear to be in my experience, but I'm not a driver. I see no markings indicate raised area is a crossing or priority
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 11:47:29	@beztweets I suppose do "look left/right" on the road make it equal to a zebra crossing? or just on-street advice to those who want to cross
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 11:53:39	@beztweets From the markings (and all we can see in that vine) I can't fault the drivers for assuming it's just road.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 16:11:22	@thestorybeast Turn to page 218 of your "Read along with twitter" book, and then tweet your reactions.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-18 16:11:35	@thestorybeast ( this would be pretty cool as an actual thing I guess )
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 09:30:36	Aurie our cat got mess on his tail last night. Then started running around brandishing it like a whip enchanted with elemental power of poo.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 09:33:42	@zoeaustin Yeah, stinky-poo-face-aurie was his nickname until he had a good clean.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 11:30:18	@daniel_barker If reverse discrimination was an actual major problem it'd just be termed discrimination.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 11:30:38	@veloevol Obviously the high viz was entirely the reason it was visible ;)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 12:14:06	@FrogCroakley That's not your mouth dude.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 12:55:42	@beztweets They're passing the buck - Trying to claim they can't do what they want until people already stop using cars as much.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 15:31:44	@AlternativeDfT *and* I disagree. It is helpful to draw attention to wastages and poor decisions. The explanation/justification is flawed.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 15:32:03	@AlternativeDfT In that if you have funds allocated, and if you can't make what you need, kick up a bigger fuss until you can. Constantly.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 15:55:26	@lastwheel I thought it stood for "Cycle Touring Club" or something.  I think the National bit is just the fact that they are a charity.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 16:21:08	@cyclegaz I live in hope of the day we might do the same. It's perpetually just over the next fiscal period.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 16:35:38	@GreenJennyJones You could try calling your own phone?  You might get lucky. Otherwise maybe the Public Carriage Office - 0845 602 7000
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 16:45:51	@daniel_barker Knock Knock.  Who's there? NO SURVIVORS
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 16:46:31	@daniel_barker Er, jinx I guess. Is that a thing on twitter?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 16:49:24	@RossLydall Are you going to review @RainPR for the ES then ;)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 16:51:39	@daniel_barker What's black and white and red all over?  NO SURVIVORS.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-20 16:56:39	@daniel_barker Quick. Trademark it, start a brand, and a clothing line before it starts trending.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-14 15:31:23	@daniel_barker Put them on vine. *nodnod*
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-14 15:32:29	@sieduk Block them all. #freeloaders #spammers #etc
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-14 15:35:46	My friend Chanelle is running the Brighton Marathon to raise money to train Guide Dogs. Please consider sponsoring: http://t.co/xQex5XXM9Z

18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-22 16:29:09	She settled on ooooo eeee ooooo
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-22 17:02:12	@jamesoff perfect
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 08:50:03	@AstuteCatte Still cold though. Maybe it'll warm up towards lunch
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-24 07:43:27	@beztweets This is actually part of the design to cope with drivers who risk red lights.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-24 08:13:00	@beztweets Honestly that I don't mind so much. Extra caution by light designers to account for other people being terrible isn't a bad thing
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-24 08:14:33	@beztweets Has not been fact checked though. Just remembered my 'source' is my primary school teacher when I was 6 :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-24 08:16:09	@beztweets Mmm - I see your point. It may be to do with traffic regulation elsewhere in the road network even.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-24 08:17:01	@beztweets I remember we came up to the transport museum and I asked loads of really stupid questions non-stop all day.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 09:41:32	@daniel_barker I think you'll find most people agree with you, so the chocolate-in-fridge group is actually the unpopular opinion here.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 09:41:59	@daniel_barker I do accept that in a heatwave it might be worth considering, but *only* then.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 09:45:47	@daniel_barker But but the chocolate goes all cold and clammy like my hands. Surely no-one sane can like that?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 09:50:56	@Wangleberry It's like I don't even know you anymore.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 09:54:45	@Wangleberry Have you checked his temperature yet? My vet says the thermometer goes up the bum.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 09:56:31	@veloevol Early prototype for google glass.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 10:10:11	@AsEasyAsRiding I'd actually be ok with the ASA nuking that advert. Hella creepy singing cat is reason enough.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 10:21:19	@Cycle_ps How long does a General level service usually take you guys, and is it the sort of thing that needs to be booked in advance?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 11:02:46	@cyclegaz a PDF of a scan of a printout of an email of a powerpoint document containing a screenshot of a webpage which wasn't loading.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 12:35:16	@daniel_barker Hmmm, I think I just need a quick head-shrink tip. Should get the same proportions with less effort.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 13:24:40	@Sputnyak Hey Olga, methinks your twitter account has been compromised.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 14:14:13	@Cycle_ps Sweet - was wondering about the logistics of a lazy day in the bar/cafe/etc while someone else works my bike. #indulgence
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 14:44:37	@victohenry You can report the tweet under abuse and then copyright.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 15:23:49	@Trynottobreathe Likely automated enforcement via CCTV cameras without any common sense applied.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 16:12:53	@dizzymabil @veloevol @cycleoptic @metpoliceuk Why are the police not all over this. Surely video is all evidence required to secure convict
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 16:29:44	@cycleoptic @dizzymabil @veloevol @metpoliceuk Interesting reading here http://t.co/RuCexPgl6F SOP for crime investigation / Min. Standards
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-21 16:30:30	@cycleoptic @dizzymabil @veloevol @metpoliceuk Seem to fall short of absolute bare minimum noted there for all crimes in cases like this.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-24 09:27:30	@cyclegaz First day I've switched out to my summer lenses. Finally light enough out.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-24 11:50:45	@andrewjlockley @cyclegaz For my glasses. I have some polarised lenses I can change in for bright weather, and clear ones for night riding.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-25 13:44:09	@CyclingMikey One minor redeeming point - looks like he *tried* to give you plenty of room for the overtake itself.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-25 14:57:32	@CyclingMikey Definitely.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-25 14:59:18	@cyclegaz er, as far as I know there's no correlation between sign colour and advisory/mandatory.  E.g. Blue shared use cycle signs
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-24 14:15:28	@daniel_barker My vision is 1:1.  *stares intensely into your eyes from 1 foot away*
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-24 15:55:36	@cyclegaz if I'm already roasting other veg, sure. Otherwise it seems a bit much for just broccoli.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-27 16:30:46	@SonOfTheWinds Is it always the last Friday of the month?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-27 16:34:32	@SonOfTheWinds Awesome, Thanks. I'm busy tomorrow, but I've put next month's in my diary.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-26 14:15:15	@dwylth If you follow them, can't they see your tweets?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-28 17:58:08	@wingerden_cross They're semi-regularly, usually see the thread full of people saying "I can't make it" then 15 people turn up anyway.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-28 18:39:43	@goatsdontshave Thanks :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-28 18:40:16	@goatsdontshave I had a fun time learning real science terms for space-stuff writing that.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-28 18:42:48	@goatsdontshave I legit laughed out loud at your exit-pun.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-27 22:07:09	@WINDY_BUTT @iliekmudkips #londonpoo hoping it won't interfere with goon pub Saturday
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-28 21:49:01	@4ChordsNoNet @BigBlokeOnABike @cyclegaz in fairness, those stats *can* take long time to update.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-02 14:27:56	If each set of glasses adds another dimension, I must be able to see through realities by now.… http://t.co/UlLrJ7Qtj0

18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-28 10:46:04	@wingerden_cross You going to the goon pub meet in Clapham South tomorrow?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-28 14:08:45	I wrote a thing for #fairytalefriday. I'm sure it's pretty bad. I'm not a writer. - "All Things Must End" http://t.co/CJavWyZ6rd #storify
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-28 14:09:27	Not a bad way to spend lunch though.  Also sorry for whoever picked the word and my almost complete ignoring of it barring terrible wordplay
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-28 14:11:12	Hey @you_twits - you're totally hacked or something right now.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-01 21:16:24	Also lunch. http://t.co/l7FaZDWy4v
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-28 15:34:06	@laureation this preceeded the #Poonami so well.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-27 09:30:32	@Wangleberry Are you coming to the pub on Saturday?  The Avalon dans le Clapham South.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-27 09:47:19	@dwylth I'll be there for at least 6 hours from noon - might stay till 8 though - you're working till 7ish aren't you?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-27 09:50:20	@WINDY_BUTT It isssss!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-02-27 09:52:43	@Wangleberry The Avalon, Clapham Sth, Noon onwards until people leave.  As usual people will drift in during the day. http://t.co/FRqgtRGXmF
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-03 10:38:31	@psweetman Just when we're all about to move onto the next thing.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-03 11:23:40	@xerode I retweet this because I echo the sentiment, but I am so guilty of this in so many things as well.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-03 11:49:25	@SonOfTheWinds You should check out @cyclegaz 's latest blog entry on http://t.co/WjrjisMaGx as it's all about the hi-viz illusion of safety
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-04 08:57:43	Oh yeah, while I remember, there was a guy cycling last night pulling a big old wheely suitcase alongside him. #skills
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-04 08:59:50	on his hybrid, full suitcase parallel to his bike in his left hand, turning corners and everything. I was very impressed.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-04 14:40:35	@FrogCroakley HASSAN! I go to sleep attaching wires from my ring main electrics to my arms to boost my biceps. Why do I wake up on fire?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-05 16:46:41	@laureation I hope you scolded said colleague adequately for a) being dangerous and b) using the wrong word.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-05 14:53:50	@AsEasyAsRiding Also, iirc, not a valid legal a substitute for your arms yet
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-04 07:36:18	Came off the bike on something wet. Tore my leggings :C #cycling http://t.co/3TospeRXda
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-04 08:26:43	@jamesoff Yup - an hour later and it's just starting to wake up to the pain
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-04 11:35:17	@AsEasyAsRiding "appears this physical separation isn't provided" - I was under impression it was soft separation. e.g Armadillos not fences
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-04 11:36:36	@AsEasyAsRiding As in, I thought it was supposed to be noticeable / used except for lanes crossing - but not full on barriers between lanes
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-04 11:38:53	@AsEasyAsRiding Like this divider between lanes just at the join on the roundabout - http://t.co/eyXPEeBWZZ You can see the slight raising
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-04 11:39:55	@AsEasyAsRiding Yes - Armadillos was the closest term I could comprehend.  But yes, if the Bedford one lacks these, it's not a 'Turbo'
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-04 11:41:19	@AsEasyAsRiding however the drawings I had seen did seem to imply that these would be present. Hopefully not just replaced with white paint!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-05 14:10:58	@beztweets I think I'd stop using any system which emailed me passwords back in plaintext. O_O
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-05 14:13:59	@beztweets Hope they cover fraud in their policy!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-06 15:34:06	@Wangleberry Avocado bathrooms are in. Beige couches making a comeback. Next season tip: Corduroy
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-06 17:36:08	@thestorybeast I was all hyped for another #fairytalefriday and had a killer idea for a sauceror thingummy then I re-read the hashtag.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-06 17:37:02	@thestorybeast :O my eyes are suddenly wide open.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-07 22:34:25	@Wangleberry A letter has been delivered unto me!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-06 11:05:15	@wingerden_cross Wooo - the finale! Looking forward to watching this at lunch.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-06 11:16:52	@jayforeman Freeze Ray Activate!

18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-06 17:36:23	@thestorybeast I really should pay more attention to twitter

18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-10 08:03:16	.@frogcroakley I added your illustrations from last night's session http://t.co/GEcB7gGcxt http://t.co/l0orVmDWKO and http://t.co/gEF0JyLNT4
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-10 08:03:58	.@frogcroakley Looks like I didn't get a shot of the dwarven ATM though.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-10 14:35:07	@majornelson Ahhh, I remember this game from my old Amstrad. Type "escape" as your first command :D

18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-10 16:35:18	@xerode ( cc @thunderrage ) We play netrunner!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-10 17:07:43	@xerode It's quite a game. I really enjoy it, but you may want to find someone with a copy and play a bit with theirs first? gets #expensive
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-10 17:16:39	@xerode like, I *really* enjoy it - bought it for my brother, but you need people to play against is the only problem with it. 2 player only
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-10 17:16:52	@xerode so it always falls by the side of our gaming weekends n stuff.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-10 22:59:03	Session #1 Summary http://t.co/O1fL8HVTru #pathfinder ( cc @wangleberry @dwylth @misterspidergod @frogcroakley @brainmage @xerode )
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-11 08:04:32	@CllrJamesBarber You have a minor typo - you say that "Somerset Police are the first *ti* pilot this course" Great news though :D #20splenty
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-11 08:45:08	The best part about these project launches, is that if you do it all right, no-one notices that anything has changed.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-11 10:38:36	And after an early morning project launch, a new crate of energy drinks has just arrived at the office.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-14 11:23:08	@Donaldosaurus Take me down to the paradigm city where the grass is astroturf and the girls are tiny plastic figurines
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-14 12:11:12	@_Enanem_ http://t.co/1amkLIZpoY  Just smoosh them together
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-13 07:22:46	So #foggy that today I will be completely invisible to The Eye of Sauron. #cycling http://t.co/iIFU3lETWa
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-13 08:33:05	@prusinger Those signs carry as much weight as a sign saying "dogs must be carried" would in the same place. They're not legal instructions.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-13 08:33:35	@prusinger Of course, that's not to say it wouldn't be advisable to follow - but bear in mind they're just shouty signs from contractors.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-13 08:35:31	@prusinger Often in those situations dismounting would take up more room. Of course, cyclist should adjust speed and position for conditions
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-13 08:38:31	@prusinger a person on a bike will always be thinner than a person adjacent to and walking their bike. Ideal sign: http://t.co/EG5LQIu1kj
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-11 10:40:01	@Thunderrage This is a crate of POSI+IVE - obviously superior just from the name.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-11 10:48:04	ALL OF THE ENERGY DRINKS! (brb: heart attack) #Posi+ive #3screens http://t.co/29THrdGqkl
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-11 11:55:57	@bendepear Quick - go and make a sign like at the zoo.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-11 12:57:56	@Suitonbike Pretty sure that most contracts and legal documents, will have plenty of clauses for summary dismissal in gross negligence cases
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-13 11:25:54	Hah - I stayed *well* away from that monstrosity. @frogcroakley however... ( @dwylth @Brainmage @you_twits @pizzahutuk @Wangleberry )
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-13 11:35:01	@dwylth I think it's telling that even the leaflets with ideal-version-photoshoot don't manage to make it look appealing.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-11 15:43:44	@n0rm try to tap-tap my cats, and they'll probably do it right back. (with claws)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-13 12:57:11	@Thunderrage Past 5 I think you're just in anime territory largely
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-13 13:29:15	New pet peeve - people that say " +1 " as "one-plus"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-14 15:57:26	@JustEatUK CRUSH COOK. JUST EAT.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-13 16:47:54	@daniel_barker Someone glued a picture of a catwalk model over his mirror. Shhh.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-13 16:55:18	@cyclegaz :O Need to go and buy a summer cycling jersey I think.  Gotten too used to the pockets on my winter one versus just plain t-shirts
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-14 19:33:45	@kevinsussman My wife and I would totally watch a spinoff show about Stuart and the comic store. Also we think that aged makeup looked great

18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 11:57:48	@adforperu Predicting a collection of no win no fee spam bots contacting you now.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 12:35:50	urgh - they fixed the speakers. Still, quiet morning was good.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 12:53:06	Hey @Brainmage - If this wasn't a NZ chap I'd suspect it was you. http://t.co/H6sliINLcp
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 14:28:34	@definitivekev Maybe you're related :O
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 14:38:27	@darkrock Are you wearing a GAME OVER shirt?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 14:38:38	@darkrock er, but GAME OVER backwards ofc.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 14:38:49	@darkrock I mean reflected, not backwards. You know what I mean #failures
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 14:43:37	@darkrock Until you have 4, it's cheaper obviously to do 4 singles, provided you have the capacity to serve them ofc.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 14:44:22	@darkrock We have to keep to (sort of) singles, with a multi-domain EV certificate. Since they generally don't do EV on wildcards.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 14:44:59	@darkrock If you suspect you might need to expand it, it's definitely worth getting an account manager, and discussing replacing mid-cert.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 14:45:57	@darkrock Since they should just be able to re-issue as a wildcard and only charge you part of the upgrade cost. Depends ofc on account man.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 15:50:33	@JustEatUK Bicycles + megaphones :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 16:31:18	@Brainmage 27-&gt;28? I had no idea you were so young. #babyface
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 16:46:41	@daniel_barker Need more evidence. Hands on the controls please.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 11:46:19	@MPSSTC You have a typo in your tweet. I think you mean "Call 101"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 11:50:52	@TfLOfficial Bright clothing makes no difference when drivers don't look. Or worse, when they see you and choose to drive dangerously.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 11:51:11	@TfLOfficial Stop blaming the victims here and do your job by making the actual roads safer.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 12:14:22	@xerode back to Netrunner, should shout at @thunderrage and find when he's free to do an afternoon of playing. Also: https://t.co/iPcbHUZbjY
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 12:14:46	@xerode Start back in 2012 and watch some of the regionals / competitions to get a good solid idea of the game.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-12 14:04:36	@definitivekev but coincidentally also signed for by SMITH? O_o
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-17 06:30:07	Straight on into tunnel. #cycling #gps http://t.co/NTeAhFAcHy
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-17 16:10:13	@darkrock but Titanfall is hella grey. Found myself falling asleep watching some footage of it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-17 16:11:42	@darkrock Here - https://t.co/nXZTgq318a - nice hour long stream recorded. Pretty fair review / commentary I think.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-18 15:53:16	@Brainmage would watch.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-19 08:58:08	@badtiems They'll probably just leave then in memorium
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-19 10:04:01	@torgo @CyclingMikey You're assigning cause where there is none. They're just looking for justification for their inherent/pre-existing bias
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-19 10:50:54	@TomNoMiddleName Likewise, good to see an old friend.  I trust you're keeping well?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-19 16:54:35	@briseglace @allpartycycling Doesn't xxxx-proof mean protecting something *against* that thing? see, Bullet-proof, bomb-proof, baby-proof
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-17 16:44:17	@daniel_barker Perhaps it's some sort of rented room insertion thing.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-19 19:53:30	At a work do, expecting to meet some of our account team. Their company haven't even invited our account managers to the event. Good job
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-18 13:38:51	@GreenJennyJones It stems from an erroneous assumption that insured drivers are good drivers and uninsured are bad drivers.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-17 20:45:58	You can't see this very well, but someone has secured their bike through my bike frame. Been trying to… http://t.co/tLNE0OYlnN
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-18 15:25:42	@FrogCroakley I'd feel nervous about eating any coins - just because it has to come out again. My poor poor sphincter.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-18 15:54:12	@parimalkumar Yeah, I very much disagree with that concept. "Don't break the law because it's against the law" is a better message to all
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-18 15:55:20	@parimalkumar rather than "don't do this because their [presumed drivers] attitude of collective blame is valid" which is preposterous.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-19 10:08:35	@torgo I agree in part. I hate seeing this behaviour also, sad for behaviour, and that people are unable to see that person as an individual
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-19 10:43:25	@CyclingDadUK Precisely. Two separate issues both need adressing.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-19 11:01:53	@TomNoMiddleName Yeah, it's good now. Was sore for a few days, scab's almost all gone now though.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-19 11:02:30	@TomNoMiddleName Biggest lingering effect is that my cornering to the right is now *way* over-cautious though. Total confidence gone leaning
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-19 10:03:12	@torgo @CyclingMikey If people blame cyclists for the behaviour of one person, that is not *because* of the behaviour of the cyclist.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-19 14:34:32	@Neris_k I think they are @ipostparcels - I certainly won't be using them with drivers like that. Absolutely atrocious!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-19 14:36:28	@Neris_k @ipostparcels Very glad they're taking it seriously, but unless companies start removing dangerous drivers it's a pretty empty move
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-19 14:37:22	@Neris_k I hope you're not too shaken up by the encounter. I was completely broken emotionally for the rest of the day when I had similar.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-20 08:37:19	@xerode is that Bear Driving Simulator? :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-20 08:54:15	@GreenJennyJones I've just tried a new route this morning which goes through burgess park. V pretty in the morning isn't it!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-20 09:32:38	@unfortunatalie "with water"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-20 12:17:01	@xerode Had you seen a good deal anywhere? I've been looking to get my own set ( core, plus the first 6 data packs ) for a little while now.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-20 12:18:58	@xerode Yeah, I've had a bit of a look around but it isn't as big over here as in the states, so fewer bundles/offers/subscriptions etc.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-20 12:19:19	@xerode Might have to just cough up and pay RRP and be done with it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-20 12:49:23	@xerode @badtiems Is it not just SPAM on the keypad of your phone.... so 7726 - varies by carrier I think
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-20 13:46:14	@cyclegaz I never *ever* thought I'd see a picture of a guy wearing a lettuce on his head...
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-20 14:39:24	@jamiesmart Yeah, not enough http://t.co/oroqzXrXYh budget over-spent and they couldn't finish the film.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-20 17:09:59	@cyclegaz Wear them in the shower, then under your clothes all day at work - obviously.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-21 10:33:07	The klaxon sounds, heralding the arrival of the doughnut trolley.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-21 08:39:29	@beztweets I have some stuff coming from pactimo due in a month or so, fully expecting a similar experience.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-21 16:20:19	@CyclingMikey Probably my first overtake where I've actually felt the road user legitimately respected my space / right to be there.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-21 16:27:08	@veloevol They took the spokes as well? wow.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-21 16:18:57	@CyclingMikey I had an absolutely excellent overtake from a Veolia van this morning.  Waited through 2 pinch points and round a bend to move
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-21 16:26:29	@AstuteCatte I recommend starting with "All By Myself". Personal fave for karaoke spirit ruining.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-21 16:52:13	@cyclegaz Yeah, apparently anyone over the age of 16 or under 60 is now a MAMIL. Also regardless of cycling experience.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-21 12:15:02	@daniel_barker You're so far ahead of the curve, they'll take 5 or 6 intermediary following of other people just to see you exist.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-21 16:25:47	@AstuteCatte Best way to kill it is to BAD KARAOKE up the place.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-21 16:33:42	@AstuteCatte smoke break. Even if you don't smoke. Learn
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-21 16:53:29	@cyclegaz I was called a MAMIL when I had just *two weeks* road cycling experience and had not a single trace of lycra on.Jeans+Hoodie+boots
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-24 13:04:18	@WINDY_BUTT cold turkey or weaning off slowly?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-24 13:11:36	@WINDY_BUTT Green Tea may help as an interim. Less caffeine than regular tea.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-23 15:42:20	@SockToi that is a forest. Not a seaside.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-24 13:47:19	@xerode welp. Ordered myself the core and first 6 expansions.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-24 16:34:11	@AsEasyAsRiding So everyone has to hold their bikes at a 45 degree angle?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-24 16:34:23	@AsEasyAsRiding Or is it really really tiny bikes only
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-24 16:51:00	@Brainmage Be thankful you have skin at least.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-24 08:31:15	@daniel_barker or "Whoops - the earth wasn't even in the same place back in 1939. Why didn't I think of that! *suffocates*"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 09:01:55	@citycyclists Typically boris bikers are seen as "That's not a cyclist. Oh crap! Are they about to wobble?!" according to drivers I've heard
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 09:04:31	@citycyclists given a wider berth as it's "not their bike is it, what do they care if it gets scratched up"etc.As if money is everything ofc
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 09:31:20	@AsEasyAsRiding The campaign started. Ran for the duration, and finished. #success
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 12:51:32	@beztweets 'Careless' should automatically imply 'dangerous' as well imo.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 12:51:58	@beztweets when driving is concerned I mean. Obviously you can do plenty of things carelessly which aren't innately dangerous.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 13:06:51	@AstuteCatte Maybe whack it on soundcloud? Somewhere for people to stream it easily without having to faff around with actual files.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 13:07:27	@MrLloydSpandex For me - that's Kay-Sa-Dee-Ahh
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 14:11:47	@ragtag @cycleoptic @roadcc Good luck parking on a pavement (legal except as noted) without driving onto the pavement (illegal everywhere)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 14:13:10	@ragtag @cycleoptic @roadcc Exceptions for access to property I believe, but I have yet to see anyone park on road &amp; push car onto pavement.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 14:14:13	@AliPlumb Damnit, this keyboard is in elvish and the password needs to be entered in dwarvish.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 14:23:46	@Chan315 "Well, I typically date Swiss figure skaters..."
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 14:55:15	@FrogCroakley imagine being turned into the majority of the components of a full english. "Just going to prep your black pudding sir."
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 15:01:57	@JustEatUK You just takeaway my breath with your witticisms.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 16:26:30	@citycyclists been closed as long as I can remember. Must be getting on over 3 years now surely?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 11:03:17	@AstuteCatte @WINDY_BUTT Used to go to Mile End when I lived just down the road from it, but it's so far now. Do miss it though.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 11:50:02	@laureation Can you lay traps in your work?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 13:16:36	Popping out tokens in my lunch hour! Hmmmm. New game smell. #netrunner #tokens http://t.co/6wd1buZDQb
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 14:55:47	@t1mmyb We have a couple of bike hoops, right near the entrance which is nice, but they're unsheltered. By comparison that is lavish!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 17:08:41	@badtiems A firework.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 17:08:55	@badtiems Also, I have one, and I'm not strapping it to a rocket.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 17:17:04	@badtiems I don't think it would get destroyed, but I think I'd lose it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 17:21:45	@dwylth sweeeeet ( @badtiems )
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-25 17:22:21	@dwylth Looks like the gopro massively unbalanced it
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 15:13:39	@laureation ^5 Sounds like a win.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 16:16:33	@AsEasyAsRiding @AlternativeDfT Well I don't know about you, but when I'm old I'll be using busses like mobility scooters, 4 yards at a time
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 17:55:37	@EvansCycles #WaterlooCut #EvansEarlybird this one is already gone. #sadface
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-27 09:31:55	@jamesoff Had a contractor in our building washing clay off his work clothes in one of ours. Which then of course blocked all of the drains
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 15:55:24	@Velocentric "As per regulation 3.2.7, all equipment not essential for racing purposes must be removed." - so gloves, helmets, glasses, etc?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-27 14:36:12	@dunos Do you feel validated now?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-27 17:04:14	@MrLloydSpandex Why would you want to leave your horse!  When people ask you Y/N questions you can just have it reply with "Neigh!".
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 11:02:20	@WINDY_BUTT @AstuteCatte If you guys are getting into climbing, I usually go tues/thurs at The Arch near Bermondsey these days
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 11:02:43	@WINDY_BUTT @AstuteCatte out of practice recently. Work keeps getting in the way and stuff, but always enjoy when I get there.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 11:11:50	@WINDY_BUTT @AstuteCatte Nah - I know the one you mean, I think that's some youth centre somewhere? but it's not this.  Clement's Road.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 13:13:45	Nerds with nerd card things. #netrunner #cards #nerds http://t.co/Wu2ocxXugs
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 14:20:22	@cyclegaz I don't know but I think I really want one. It's just so bizzare!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 14:54:22	@t1mmyb Wow - that looks very nice. Wonder if I can get my Sainsburys to do something similar (CC @sainsburys - FAO Dog Kennel Hill/Dulwich)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 14:58:50	@notch I have no opinion on your statement whatsoever.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-28 09:54:25	@theJeremyVine Every collision is one for the police. Legal requirement even. If he didn't stop to give you his details, that's offense also
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-28 10:33:40	@taffysaint If you're free on Sunday, do you fancy coming along as well? I'm meeting up with a colleague via my route through clapham also
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-28 10:36:21	@n0rm Do you know if there's a pub in the park? I might need a break for lunch :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-26 15:49:49	@beztweets But I totally walk to the bus, and stand the *entire* way.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-27 09:34:14	And I'll supplement that with it is absolutely essential education for every cyclist to see just how little HGVs can see in any direction.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-27 16:48:34	@alz Now you're proper famous.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-27 17:00:01	@MrLloydSpandex or read anything. Or interact with people.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-27 09:35:03	In addition, something not shown at these events, if an HGV cab isn't dead straight on, all of those mirrors are completely useless. #besafe
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-27 10:05:40	@Neris_k I'm planning (Sunday) to go to cycle round richmond park.  Bit further than I usually go, but it should also be lovely.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-27 14:40:59	@mbot_spud Looks like a mashup of Star Wars, Riddick, Tron, Matrix stuff, and Ender's Game. Actually quite interested.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-30 10:53:56	Cycling in Richmond park. @ Roehampton Gate http://t.co/b4fhxD7jXW
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-30 11:34:47	Deer everywhere.  #deer @ Richmond Park http://t.co/NJQpuVzehe
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-30 11:35:52	Look! More deer! #deer #cycling @ Richmond Park http://t.co/wZFrpztDbc
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-28 10:32:17	Planning to do my longest bike ride yet on Sunday. Over to richmond park, round a couple of time, and then home again.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-28 10:37:04	@n0rm That's perfect.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-28 14:41:01	@beztweets My friend took that photo. Even prompted a twitter apology from British Airways (though not really needed, as pre-queued content)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-30 16:12:40	Flapjack Break. Not sure I can stomach a second lap with that hill at the start! #cycling @ Roehampton… http://t.co/wMWeuMXbKN
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-28 10:32:35	Gonna be 10.25 miles just to reach the start of the park circuit! (and the same back again ofc)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-28 10:35:16	@n0rm Round the roads I think, clockwise from the roehampton gate. I've never been before - not planning to gun it or anything. :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-28 11:50:21	@BigBlokeOnABike V disappointed with #roadsafe - Responses like this must be why there are growing murmurs to just take matters in own hands
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-28 20:17:43	@teamcovenant #GamingReborn if only you guys had a UK operation. Love all your netrunner videos.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-31 10:31:04	@Wangleberry Oh my word - just read your updates from yesterday, Yikes. Glad he's doing ok though.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-03-31 14:57:03	@Brainmage Glad you're conscious and not too broken dude.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-01 06:13:19	Burgess Park this morning. #cycling @ Burgess Park http://t.co/e8Nbu9slhx
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-01 06:51:21	@Wangleberry Definitely the better choice.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-01 07:12:44	Re: last RT - I suppose at least our power was back up in a second, unlike some people who had till 1am without power.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-01 07:15:40	@4ChordsNoNet Why does april have 31 days O_o secret-double-april-fool?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-01 07:16:23	@4ChordsNoNet So does your May month start on the Friday? or on the Thursday like it should?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-01 09:25:20	@Wangleberry @daniel_barker Likewise. I could get to yours between 6:30 and 7 if you like. Happy to help with cleaning n stuff too :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-01 09:31:26	@unfortunatalie Six peas, one grape.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-01 12:32:31	@Brainmage Well, not for this anyway. :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-01 12:35:25	@WINDY_BUTT I hope they do it because they do insane exercise and really need to replenish because of sweating etc. Otherwise ick.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 07:14:00	Pretty sure that if I didn't cycle all the time I wouldn't be fit/healthy enough to cope with the air quality at the moment.*coughs up lung*
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 07:49:13	@amadan_eagla I would love bikes to get dynamos as standard, with USB charging sockets in convenient places. Stems, Frames, Seatposts, etc.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 08:28:14	@zoeaustin Not sure I can cough up the entirity of Beijing!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 08:31:14	@zoeaustin I saw someone with an electric bike yesterday evening. Trundling past with no effort and a small electric motor whine #cheater :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 09:17:30	@dunos headphones with built in microphones that dangle near your chest ( @n0rm ) - I see people walking holding them, talking right at them
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 09:18:36	@dunos @n0rm *YELLS INTO PHONE BASE* IS THIS BETTER? MIGHT BE A BAD LINE.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 09:19:11	@dunos @n0rm I also see that a lot. People talking into one end of their phone then flipping the phone around entirely to listen to response
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 09:51:45	@Maddogrugby @Suitonbike @poonalk @beztweets Scary - just ~300yds away from my office. Terrible loss. RIP. Glad I always avoid the junction.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 09:57:32	@psweetman Just in case you see it in the news, that's not me in the Fleet Street / Ludgate Circus collision. &lt;3
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 10:11:25	@Brainmage Are you home yet? Or still under observation?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 10:13:40	@steveocrom Is London your home turf? I feel more in control around streets I know well.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-04 07:05:20	@HayleyHeartbrk and in real life too - just look over your shoulder.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-04 07:50:22	Work social tonight so no bike, but I probably could do with a rest day anyway.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-04 07:52:19	Did take twice as long as what is now normal to get to my desk though. Such a big difference now I'm used to riding.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-04 08:29:20	@Brainmage Does it help to brace your head with your hands before the sneeze?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-04 10:14:06	@LiterallyGeeked urging supression? :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-04 10:51:25	@laureation Quick. Spotify! Give me a playlist suited to "listening to music".
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-04 10:55:49	@n0rm imo - that should be regulated against. Free trials should come with no strings.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-04 10:57:33	@n0rm Goods vs Services distinction :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-04 11:12:11	@daniel_barker Do you do stencils? I always fancied some flames or go-faster stripes.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-04 12:46:32	@veloevol I haven't seen spokey-dokeys in about 20 years when we used to get them in cereal boxes! :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-04 12:47:11	@veloevol now I have to go and buy some and sneak them onto my brother's bike when he's not looking.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 08:04:51	@beztweets Pretty sure I know some traffic lights which have taken more than 5 minutes for me to get through :) But then just wiggle a bit.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 13:07:10	@EwaSR It's the giant googly-eye which really makes it something special.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 13:34:30	@daniel_barker Now thinking about body-mods to get pockets in your legs. Mmm warm and fleshy.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-01 06:15:55	And another sunrise over Burgess Park. #cycling @ Burgess Park http://t.co/vnglqSGn0D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-01 07:17:52	@4ChordsNoNet I need to buy a bunch of calendars like that and just give them away to people.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-01 09:00:45	@Wangleberry I'm so pleased for you both that he is improving. Maybe you can get him one of those plastic shame collars for when he gets out
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-04 14:12:35	@laureation print him out a Hang In There kitten poster thing.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 09:29:15	@daniel_barker I just sat down with a fresh one. :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 09:39:27	@daniel_barker Surely all of your selfies have been after-sex selfies since sex (not necessarily with you involved) has been around forever.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 10:48:15	@DrMoroch0 I dislike that they're terming the road as dangerous here when their example is drivers / riders being dangerous.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 10:56:02	@Wangleberry Try to take it easy, ok? :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 14:31:21	@BBCTomEdwards Nice that their prompt and decisive action on a junction they know is unsafe has saved lives. No wait, the other thing.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 13:39:05	@4ChordsNoNet Yeah, I have the same. Often text her when I'm setting off from work, she knows it's a 25-30 mins journey so alleviates worry.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 14:09:07	@beztweets @4ChordsNoNet Location based triggers? Nice. "Heading Off" , "About a mile away now" etc.  Might be a bit much every day though
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 14:12:23	@beztweets @4ChordsNoNet when coming home from archery my wife texts with "~10 mins away, please start a bath running."
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 16:24:45	@daniel_barker @Brainmage Not sure they come from the brain. It's a dark dark place which sources those.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-03 16:26:05	@Wangleberry ( @Brainmage ) :D Glad he's ( you're ) doing better. Hope it doesn't hurt too long.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 06:53:35	@Wangleberry At a certain point sleep isn't very restful - just necessary. It'll get better!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 09:28:53	@AstuteCatte whatcha get?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 09:35:57	@xerode Smells like you, so cat is happy. I guess. Also means you must smell like fart
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 10:14:42	@mangmangmang Address to one person, mention you're CCing in other person for their record, then ignore the CCd person entirely?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 13:39:37	@4ChordsNoNet We used to be able to just use Google Latitude, but the service was sort of stopped / made impractical.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 14:08:02	@beztweets @4ChordsNoNet I'll have to check that out.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 14:09:25	@beztweets @4ChordsNoNet But I can at least suggest to the missus :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-02 14:24:06	@thestorybeast Awwww, Who's the cutest Samwise Gamgee impersonator. You are! That's who! *pinches cheek*
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-05 07:25:41	Me: Do you have anything vegetarian?
Vendor: These four pasties. And of these, this one is *the most* vegetarian.
Me: O_o

18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-08 16:17:26	@AsEasyAsRiding Looks like they're treating the armadillos as the kerb with their attempt to guage parking position?

18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-08 10:46:17	@dwylth I know it's not perfect, but #eh
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-08 10:54:48	@Jon_events Good to see the effect.Though would they even stray into the cycle lane if there was a segregating kerb there between the lanes?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-08 11:15:00	@Brainmage I love this so much.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-06 12:03:08	Just finished perhaps the most alcoholic long island iced tea ever. I think they only used spirits in it. Must get another
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-07 13:23:30	@EwaSR Does your heart beat well enough to pump blood around all 6'1" of you?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-07 14:40:57	@xerode I think you can only bring a prosecution if they actually try to enact a detainment or arrest (presumably by physical means)

18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-11 09:58:24	@parimalkumar why does anyone care?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-10 11:20:03	@AstuteCatte I take it you're also not The Boss
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-11 12:04:19	Just noticed this on my service ticket from @cycle_ps in Camberwell. I've never been called Great like… http://t.co/0nLkNwORuI
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-12 20:25:59	@tiffingston @Duds_2k Always prefer strawberries, but don't feel like you need to bring anything for me. I'll have cycling snacks with me :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-14 07:03:08	@EwaSR multi-pocalypse. All of the pocalypse at once.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-10 16:09:06	Oh god, I googled some life insurance info for a colleague to talk them through somethn, now my internet is full of guilt ads and depression

18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-14 16:26:06	@CyclingMikey video was taken down by Youtube because of their harassment/bullying/threatening policy, and he goes on comment spree? nutter.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-14 16:29:55	@CyclingMikey Looks like all of his comments have disappeared now also :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-11 16:30:05	@CyclingMikey I wish them a speedy recovery and hope they are not too badly injured :/
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-11 18:36:50	@nickmurison @jamesoff @duds_2k bike seems fine. I'll take out out for a little spin tomorrow just to make sure.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-15 12:28:50	@jeb_ Definitely this - it's only a minor setback that it doesn't keep the undo history in the same way.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-15 13:08:29	@carltonreid Great piece. Here's hoping it's well received over there.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-16 07:46:12	Oh god what is happening to me. I've been nerding out over different pedal types and clip systems and stuff. #cycling
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-16 07:50:22	@n0rm Wut?! I just googled that and I don't understand how that is a pedal. :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-16 10:15:41	@markbikeslondon *raises hand*
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-11 07:45:24	@4ChordsNoNet not uncomfortably sweaty after the ride?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-17 08:51:24	Trains are *so* expensive, that it is cheaper for my boss and our head of content to take a chauffeured merc over from Cirencester to here.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-17 12:21:11	@citycyclists Did they say why they made it dangerously narrow in the first place?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-17 13:05:50	@Wangleberry Some of my colleagues are under mid 20s, and account managers. They give theirs out all the time to clients. Don't exchange tho
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-17 13:06:11	@Wangleberry under 35 / mid 20s. Not sure what happened there quite O_o

18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-19 19:46:48	@dunos 68, but I'm not sure I agree with the list. There are some quite good films on there, and plenty bad ones not.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-22 07:05:37	@beztweets To be fair, in that environment it sounds more like so that the staff don't lose one under a hedge after play-time or anything.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-22 15:47:45	@Wangleberry If you're looking for a F2P CCG - http://t.co/OG1lcnbY9b has more depth to it from a tactical point of view.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-22 15:48:29	@Wangleberry OP of that thread has some bulletpoints about the differences etc so you may be interested depending on why you fancy trying HS

18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-25 08:31:11	@CllrJamesBarber I wouldn't be surprised if there was a similar movement this time again.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-25 14:54:54	@EwaSR Called it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-25 14:55:25	@EwaSR I would watch the hell out of this.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-25 16:28:28	@AsEasyAsRiding I get a major sadface at vehicle caused damage like that.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-30 15:39:30	@TechnicallyRon @EwaSR @jamiesmart Very glad I had my OH GOD WHAT shock reaction to that several years ago.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-30 16:09:47	@parimalkumar And no-one knows which lane they're supposed to be in either. Hate it round there
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-28 11:42:37	@n0rm Are you in the crossharbour DLR tesco? O_o
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 11:01:18	@AsEasyAsRiding regular re-tests would do wonders. My brother passed test &gt;10 years ago, drove for ~10 hrs in the first year, and not since.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 11:02:12	@AsEasyAsRiding Still completely fine for him to dive back behind the wheel, because no laws have changed he needs to prove awareness of.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 11:19:25	@beztweets crumbs, so cyclists get squashed by cars refusing to yield, and then hit by the kerb on the roundabout itself #goodwork @sustrans
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 12:26:39	@beztweets looks like demonology summoning sign.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 13:29:09	@LiterallyGeeked Gonna stay blissfully ignorant then! Subtweet schmubtweet.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 13:33:32	@ppiixx @n0rm if ever I have to fire someone with a good sense of humour I'm using that.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 15:05:12	@cyclegaz I usually hang mine out of the office window to dry off. Today, er, no.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 15:20:44	@Trynottobreathe Just text flatmate immediately. Best option really.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 15:26:04	@daniel_barker weeing *in* a train? that's not better though is it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 15:36:41	@beztweets We need proximity horns or something to fire off automatically at cars drifting within X distance.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 15:37:09	@beztweets with a little pre-warning to us as the cyclist naturally.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-30 08:39:09	@EwaSR Worst part is that Earls Court doesn't even tell you which side you should be waiting on until the last minute. Do not envy you.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-30 08:40:11	@EwaSR Oh hey - lots of people. My favourite thing. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-29 07:39:27	@beztweets They would have just all been stuck in the big old traffic jam out there.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-29 07:41:29	@FrogCroakley Got your soundtrack ready : http://t.co/Etc8siWGcs
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-29 07:42:57	@FrogCroakley Track 6. Proper buddy cop music.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-29 07:59:30	@FrogCroakley Pull em all in for questioning. Draft in both night and swing shifts for more interviewing power. And get Ainsley on the horn!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-29 08:00:20	@cycleoptic Today there is a sea of lost bewildered new drivers out there. So many turns without warning, sudden braking, red running etc.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-30 10:05:26	@JustEatUK Some things never change. Always going to be more strikes over the horizon. At least it's a nice day to walk and stuff though :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-30 10:05:45	@JustEatUK Expecting to build up a nice appetite on the way home. :D

18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-30 10:17:27	@Sparkes Can you bring charges against the force, I think that falls below the required bare minimum standard for incident investigation.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-04-30 11:30:35	@CyclingMikey Sometimes I think It's a shame using mobile phone jammers is illegal in the UK.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-02 07:54:43	@Brainmage Did you forget you installed a mirror above your bed?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-02 08:28:20	@CityPolice I would absolutely love it if from time to time you had a absolute zero tolerance enforcement day.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-02 08:29:33	@darkrock Still bill them for time and the coffee
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-02 08:58:11	@beztweets As in everything, all words before the "but" can be removed to get to the crux of a person's point. See: I'm not racist but...
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-02 10:40:28	@cyclegaz Didn't you have something similar happen to your brand new blaze also?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-02 12:17:30	@JonGracey were you shouting piss off at the same time?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-02 13:36:24	Wondering why the weekend isn't here yet.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-02 13:47:49	@Brainmage Oh. Did he die? :C
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-02 14:37:01	@jennyvelo well at least they didn't just mix them together first.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-02 15:29:11	@cyclegaz windy today though!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 08:32:47	@AsEasyAsRiding Urgh - those just make getting my bike through with panniers an absolute pain. Sure it's *slow* but I have to lift the bike!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 08:52:06	@daniel_barker That sent shivers right up my spine.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 08:53:55	@Brainmage Obviously none of these are "people". er....
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 09:19:59	@suzieplantto If they're pad brakes that's completely normal. The squeaking is often just tiny flecks of metal rubbing against metal.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-01 09:20:38	@suzieplantto For pad brakes (e.g. v-brakes / caliper brakes), squeaking is just more evidence that they're working correctly.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-06 09:13:28	@JonGracey you mean krill you surely?

18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-08 16:05:46	@beztweets on some level I'd prefer a "cyclists stay back" sticker - at least it's more honest about not giving a fig.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-12 10:06:45	Ghah - what is wrong with you @daniel_barker ( @Wangleberry )
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-12 10:33:23	@seesense_cc My front light discharged entirely after weekend of non-use. Could it be because I had it stored on its side all weekend?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-12 10:41:52	@cyclegaz Always seems like a convoluted method. Find place, get bank to agree to do mortgage for that place in principle, tell agent, ...
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-12 10:42:05	@cyclegaz find out you missed your chance because the bank took 5 days to get back to you.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-12 11:03:25	@seesense_cc Already recharged for this evening, I'll keep an eye on it and update you. Up till then (4x20min rides) drain was as expected.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-14 08:57:00	@Wangleberry Still needs about 300 more words.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-14 09:00:33	@LiterallyGeeked but only for a short while O_o

18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-13 09:06:43	@markbikeslondon Out of London this weekend, but I'll be there in spirit.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-13 09:48:31	@ragtag my goodness - that's awful.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-13 11:11:48	@Wangleberry Possibly - you thinking Saturday or Sunday? I've not been since it got turned into mostly anime zone.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-13 12:34:35	@beztweets I linked you to an article with a guide :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-13 12:35:53	@beztweets admittedly full of disclaimers like "this only works with some hardware" and "finnicky"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-13 12:36:48	@beztweets very much no. Sadly there's pretty much no standard for features or interfaces or anything.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-14 18:34:46	@seesense_cc good to know! Thanks for the info and quick response. I'll just plan to charge my front light regularly.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-14 16:33:02	Already getting excited about the midnight performance of Titus Andronicus at the globe, and it's still over a month away!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-14 17:21:16	@seesense_cc Report: Front intense, full power solid light no flash, 5 x 20 min rides in daylight, now reporting zero green flashes on fuel.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-14 17:22:16	@seesense_cc Rear intense: Full power, flashing, same rides, reporting 5 green 2 red on fuel.Does the front being no flash really make ...
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-14 17:22:33	@seesense_cc such a huge difference in runtime or do you think there's some other drain on my front light?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-14 17:23:29	@seesense_cc I suppose including time to get to and from the road, the ride times are more like 30 mins each. So 2.5 hrs usage on each light

18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-22 11:19:02	We did more burds! Falconry this time. #holiday #centerparcs #longleat @ Center Parcs Longleat http://t.co/eL9E3tphc2
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-23 08:22:41	The rain has arrived just in time for the end of our break. Thanks for waiting!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-23 08:24:32	@Staunton_James @eat_news I use this Eat and agree wholeheartedly.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-22 14:23:07	Also holds my frappuccino nicely! #centerparcs #longleat #holiday #willowweaving @ Center Parcs Longleat http://t.co/RFQejVNHqK
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-24 17:01:32	Just saw a guy in these credits called Jazz Flood. Best name. #xmen
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-28 08:42:08	@JustEatUK Not quite, but it was my birthday yesterday so today is always gonna seem a downer in comparison :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-27 13:28:40	@GBCycleEmbassy They "obviously" must just be changing from one bus to another. They daren't use that crossing!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-29 09:15:38	@beztweets For cycling? I'm on Android and use the bikehub app, because it has voice prompts (rare) and uses cyclestreets data.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-29 09:20:27	@beztweets Hmm, tbh I pre-plan my routes on the device itself, and as far as I know, yes it does - because re-planning when you go wrong.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-29 10:06:50	I wonder if anyone has done a three wolf moon shirt with Wolf from Gladiators on it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-28 13:44:50	@cyclegaz I had this age old idea about little drones following and providing floodlights for the path/road ahead. Make it happen Gaz!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-28 15:45:05	@JustEatUK I ate a lot of pizza and watched the old Stallone Judge Dredd film with my lovely wife who put up with the film very patiently.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-28 15:45:19	@JustEatUK so pretty ace evening overall :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-28 15:46:28	@JustEatUK Firezza (one of yours) in my area always get their deliveries over double quick. Had barely started the film even.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-27 14:30:49	@LiterallyGeeked Get a job fostering cats.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-27 15:38:50	@markbikeslondon I just came from Center Parcs (Longleat) that appears to just be standard 'segway experience' gear for them.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-27 15:48:55	@markbikeslondon Ugh, Mumsnet? I'd rather listen to my curtain twitching conspiracy filled neighbours. *reads article... *cracks up laughing
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-27 15:52:01	@markbikeslondon the deer we saw occasionally had no hi-viz though. Not a bit. No cyclists hit any deer though despite natural camo.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-27 16:26:07	As I grow old I'm slowly turning into John Criswell. I have no problem with this. He's awesome http://t.co/h8Scyujmv5 http://t.co/HrFLNkNBjm
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-29 11:13:12	@jayforeman Yaaay! I shall enjoy watching this over lunch :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-29 11:17:03	@seesense_cc Check out the other video, showing the van turning across and the light going nuts (in a good way) http://t.co/1y2BJ0lHc3
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-27 11:48:47	@Wangleberry Vinnie Jones = Mr Crocodile running an extortion racket. He breaks legs and sends people "down river".Something alligator tears
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-29 15:42:03	@Wangleberry Vertically. Each tagline offered starts with a meme word.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-29 15:45:53	Moving office tomorrow. Currently the keyfobs to get in don't even work and the network patching is a pile of incomplete parts.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-27 18:42:52	It's my birthday so we're ordering pizza, and going to watch the old Judge Dredd film followed by starting BSG :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-27 18:43:41	Also thanks phone for autocorrect Judge Dredd to Judge Dress. That would be a wholly current evening.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-27 19:26:37	@CathTwo unlike some, you actually see us as different people :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-27 14:30:31	@Thunderrage Sure you can, but even a custom made something that good wouldn't counteract all the shite out there. ( @Brainmage )
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-27 15:51:05	@markbikeslondon I didn't see any so I guess not? Mind you the Lions could well be in the safari nearby outside the park.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-27 15:56:30	@markbikeslondon I can see the posters. Horses, deer, lions etc all over them. "Don't be blinkered! Wear Hi-Vis" [artistic roadkill shot].
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-27 16:15:43	@_DanielFinn ^5 All the best people (me also) have birthdays today. Happy Birthday.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-30 08:20:37	@londoncyclist in the rain no less!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-30 08:32:38	@4ChordsNoNet How else would you know what a great hunter he is though!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-30 08:49:39	@Thunderrage Down one floor, across 2 doors.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-30 10:43:37	@CathTwo Good thing on that ignite thing btw, saw it yesterday. Want more letters and more than 5 mins!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-30 13:03:12	.@Xerode I saw these and thought of you. Glospex - https://t.co/BS3HLkA8V8  http://t.co/DRnvMXPfck
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-30 15:24:51	Just about moved offices. At least the internet is working now at the new one.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-01 12:40:20	Socialising with the neighbors. This feels wrong. http://t.co/HRSPDC5qe6
18186373	dmatryx	2014-05-31 08:29:13	@nickmurison omg. Only just? Next you're going to say you've never seen hackers or something
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-03 09:25:57	@xerode Do you Strava or just Runkeeper?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-03 09:46:13	@xerode Strava? Sure-moreso if you cycle and run, I used runkeeper a long time ago, find Strava to be tad more social but they're both good
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-03 09:49:08	@xerode It does running just as well as cycling, and I like the instagram integration.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-02 08:18:20	@cyclegaz Cyclist under a tipper truck :/
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-03 15:53:00	I have some peppermint herbal tea. It tastes like someone has just mixed hot water and toothpaste together.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-02 09:53:54	@CyclingMikey Love the new angle on the video.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-02 10:21:36	@cyclegaz Until the safe infrastructure is in place, I'd rather pay more for my doughnuts / not have them available. ( @markbikeslondon )
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-03 09:46:48	@xerode Then my use my be biased towards the fact that I have more fitness friends now than I used to, and present day Strava vs old RunKP
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-03 10:05:21	@xerode Out for a run or a ride, see a nice sunset or busted up old tree, take an instagram, it'll show against the run/ride based on GPS.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-03 12:23:45	@Wangleberry You'll be able to reveal they're not actually his balls he's snapchatting.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-03 13:11:41	@Brainmage was in the dentist the other day, the smell of burning tooth from the drill REALLY got me going.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-05 10:44:51	Survived another work social, though I hope next time we don't re-book the bucking bronco. #saddlesore
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-05 10:49:31	@xerode 40 seconds. I tore a muscle in my back earlier in the week so voluntarily bailed when it got to fierce jerking levels. Winner was 88
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-05 10:50:19	@xerode Nope really mundane. Just turning to the right while carrying my bike.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-05 10:53:10	@xerode maybe to cope with stupid things like 1-800-BUSTED
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-04 10:02:38	@Brainmage So you'd be a cat then.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-03 15:26:25	@daniel_barker it's because you stand outside a lot.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-05 15:36:30	@markbikeslondon That bike parking is *unreal*.  Proper amazed.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-05 12:30:00	@dwylth @badtiems @fourquartersbar Well it's only about 20 mins walk away from my place so I'll probably check it out sometime.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-06 08:50:29	@daniel_barker What a perfect disguise. I'll have to try some of these "clothes"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-06 12:16:27	Blazing hot sunshine and stifling heat. Perfect weather for a boiling hot soup.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-06 12:17:42	Also this soup is spicy. Even better.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-09 14:52:16	@n0rm I had 6! plus my lunch. :9
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-09 14:52:23	@n0rm mini-babybel though
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-09 15:58:56	@4ChordsNoNet Locks left on a public rack are just litter. Ignore them. Worst case, they can retrieve their lock just by unlocking it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-09 15:59:22	@4ChordsNoNet Locks left on a private rack, e.g. in a company, er, ask inside the company for policy I guess?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-08 10:24:02	@SockToi if you're not doing anything today, you're welcome to come over and hang. We've got my brother inbound currently for board games
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-10 12:02:30	@LiterallyGeeked I'm excited for this. Going to the midnight showing at the end of the month :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-10 12:15:38	@jayforeman "Weren't there more walls?" "Also where's the city guard gone?" "How long was I frozen in ice for?!"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-10 08:24:41	@cyclegaz to keep it wheel? *groan so hard*
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-11 13:16:44	@youreviltwinLP @augustgirl515 I'm not sure which is worse, seeing over 100 episodes or seeing that each 'episode' is a 3.5 hour long stream
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-10 10:06:32	@4ChordsNoNet Unless they're going to raise the minimum fine as well I don't think we'll actually see much difference overall.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-10 10:42:50	Ignoring people you know in the street because you hadn't specifically arranged to meet them. #BritishValues
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-09 10:27:24	@Brainmage Nice photo of a penguin with some flamingoes dude.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-13 14:16:51	@cycleoptic @beztweets *facepalm*
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-13 16:27:41	@Neris_k Lol - small internet I guess. @jaymeekae actually stayed with me for a while a few years back.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-13 16:34:35	@Neris_k @jaymeekae Aww thanks goons &lt;3 :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-13 07:51:24	@parimalkumar handled internally or something I expect.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-13 08:24:03	@cyclegaz Gratz dude. Lovely day for it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-14 18:34:49	@Zoe_Hands hah, that would be amazing but no, that's just the beer bottle I think
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-13 08:50:37	@jamiesmart the spec details they should retry for up to 72 hours in cases of just delay or cannot deliver. sender will usually get fail msg
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-13 08:51:14	@jamiesmart and re-delivery attempts will be slowly staggered, determined by the Mail Transfer Agent (MTA). 5 mins, 10 mins, 2 hours, etc.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-13 08:59:52	Planning a new deck for some Netrunner this weekend. I'm thinking I'll give the Tenin Institute a whirl.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-13 09:21:21	@Neris_k Why would you not?! :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-13 09:22:06	@Neris_k More seriously, I imagine it feels quite liberating, though I'd worry about sunburning my bits or something.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-13 09:23:09	@Neris_k Last time the naked bike ride was on, everywhere it was going was closed off to traffic I think, pollution was pretty low.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-13 09:24:15	@Neris_k Most of the rest I agree with, but safety in numbers helps two points, and re: seats, a good clean before and after advised!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-13 09:24:58	@Neris_k but then, I think people don't clean their bike seats enough anyway. I would never do it on a public bike! #ewwww
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-13 12:12:50	@beztweets A "careful" driver wouldn't get caught, or something. #everythingisterrible

18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-15 07:41:34	Good luck to everyone doing L2B today ( @nickmurison @jamesoff )
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-16 15:36:36	@dunos my rain sensor is my face.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-16 16:24:49	@daniel_barker It's a frame job. Also this is a start of a political thriller action movie. Your move.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-18 10:50:21	@JustEatUK Just use stacks of old takeaway boxes as makeshift tables and chairs, then invite more friends. #sorted
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-18 10:54:59	@JustEatUK http://t.co/cKjbWpesWK Here's a design. Takes 6 pizza boxes by my estimation.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-18 13:24:05	@FrogCroakley COUNT THOSE LEGS
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-18 14:49:02	@daniel_barker They'll be on a dopamine high.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-18 15:23:17	@FrogCroakley 4:20 Punch Cen'pedes erry day.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-18 15:24:24	@FrogCroakley Joke would have worked better if you waited 1 minute to tweet.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-17 07:35:02	@beztweets I've seen this - they just stand up on the pedals all the time and never sit down
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-17 07:38:52	@beztweets what about a traditionally ladies frame with the dropped tube to allow for skirts etc?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-17 07:40:48	@beztweets Then, er, bike as a fashion accessory? Like people who just carry skateboards?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-17 07:45:16	@daniel_barker Just read it,I agree with you entirely.Spreading a crap 'joke' to 41k followers widens its audience and spreads the sentiment
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-17 07:46:27	@CyclingDadUK :) I went back and forth with 'historically', I used to ride one myself because it was a hand-me-down from my sister.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-17 07:47:10	@CyclingDadUK But in no way wanted to imply that "these bikes are for men" and "these bikes are for women" as that's just absurd!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-17 08:20:48	@cyclegaz has it been a gradual change? If so it could be to do with your seat height.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-19 00:50:51	Perhaps the earliest that I've come into work (and not just still been here from the day before). Think I got about 30 mins sleep.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-19 09:13:13	@feliciaday Thumbs up for cycling. Great day for it
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-19 09:59:05	@badtiems turn up anyway and make it super-akward
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-19 03:34:27	TV Pitch: Druidic themed police show / CSI style show set in and around forests. Title: Copse
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-19 03:35:07	In my defense, I'm still at work.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-19 08:33:39	@FrogCroakley Salute everything randomly I guess. They don't have eyes of their own and they like to make a good impression.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-19 08:34:22	@FrogCroakley Also high five @Brainmage
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-20 02:21:21	@majornelson This is the only thing I dislike about coming back to games, spending a while being rubbish again while I re-learn how to walk.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-22 08:44:53	Our neighbours have invited Aurie round for a garden tea party. #Aurelius #cat #catsofinstagram http://t.co/shQlhzz2tb
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-22 14:58:03	Very productive weekend gardening. Still loads on my todo list but we got four new honeysuckle plants in, herbs all re-potted &amp; patio sorted
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-22 14:59:44	@jayforeman you should go the other way as well out to the Thames barrier :) I hear it is grand also. Gonna do it myself soon
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-22 15:04:17	Kitten is just too #hot #Aurelius #cat #catsofinstagram http://t.co/eqg2FAvhA2
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-20 07:13:51	@FrogCroakley T Red sounds like a rapper.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-23 15:17:08	@_PhilipM I'm wondering if it'll be able to tell us how many obnoxious people have rucksacks on seats next to them when the bus is busy ;)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-23 15:25:57	@cyclegaz @TheGreenCourier Lol. What a pleasant company. World needs more 'grass'es. Although I'd legit love it if you did join the force.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-24 07:42:04	@jamiesmart change the password and de-authorise applications in the settings area.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-24 12:35:48	@badtiems 3 days is enough time to shake illness. Just try to actually rest :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-23 09:15:20	@beztweets Queue for coffee also.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-23 10:48:21	@beztweets Mine often says "Hey, I don't think you're aware I'm here. Hi!"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 09:05:14	@Brainmage bout bloody time. I've been horribly productive this week.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 10:24:40	and much credit to @jaymeekae for inspiring that tweet.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 10:53:39	@nic0 would follow
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 10:56:46	@Brainmage This is a better look for you.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 12:34:57	@veloevol Though it eliminates argument of "oh you can't see it clearly" type excuses. It should be taken more seriously being so clear.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 12:35:29	@veloevol Not saying it's safe to do, just that better evidence should always be treated as better evidence,not discounted because of effort
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 14:38:42	@Wangleberry Awesome :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 15:41:05	erk. I've listened to so much metal today that I'm now getting niche dating adverts targeted for metalheads.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 15:42:06	Quite impressive for it to have edged out all of the work related ads for a change.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 16:24:09	@BoardChris Er, road tax was abolished in 1937. General taxation pays for upkeep of roads. i.e. my entirely pedestrian taxes subsidise cars
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 16:27:12	@BoardChris Well, as a pedestrian, my taxes go to upkeep the roads that I don't drive on. That's a subsidy.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 16:29:22	@BoardChris Eh, I'm sure other people have called you on it but your figures are massively wrong. Also, you presume that all car pollution..
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 16:30:00	@BoardChris .. tax should go directly to just the DOT which is also incorrect as the DOT don't deal with everything relevant.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 16:32:42	@BoardChris Here are some by no means extensive, breakdowns of some externalities to be considered : http://t.co/zRJXkUyx5d
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 16:41:52	@BoardChris To be fair, you're largely discussing sensibly, just seem to miss the point that there's more cost to motors than road building
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 16:42:52	@BoardChris Well, that and the assertion that people who pay more get priority. That was the big one.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 16:45:04	@BoardChris Legally, outside of private roads, they don't.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-26 16:45:45	@BoardChris Barring motorways as well I think actually.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-24 11:09:49	@DamoMils Great responsible attitude there to safe driving. Bet you'd change your tune if he was driving near the kids in your profile pic.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-24 11:10:55	@DamoMils I *love* that @cyclegaz and others like him record and report this dangerous behaviour because it makes things safer for everyone.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-24 12:38:38	@Brainmage They've scrute you well.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-25 08:45:16	@Neris_k Yes - almost every time I try to get to sleep
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-25 08:46:04	Commuting through London this morning at 6am was glorious. So quiet, and really lovely and warm already.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-25 08:51:58	@jacs1984 Every other week I have to commute out of London, so cycle up over to Paddington early to catch the train
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-25 09:20:51	@EwaSR in slow motion!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-25 09:23:08	@EwaSR Have you reached the season 2 finale yet? I think that's the one I love.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-25 11:42:20	@Brainmage Has he been out in the sun? is he wearing black? These could all increase his temperature
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-27 09:33:47	@cyclegaz nowhere suitable to fix the lock's mount?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-27 09:56:49	@cyclegaz looks like just over £10 for a replacement ( :O ) if you felt the need to replace.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-28 21:09:43	When your dominoes pizza is in quality control, does that mean someone is licking it to check the flavor?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-28 21:11:14	Currently watching some CSI: Morpheus
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-27 10:59:29	@EwaSR not lightningcats? For shame!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-06-30 12:45:01	@daniel_barker dickinabox?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-01 08:26:32	@MrLloydSpandex You'd get a high five from me for that.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-01 08:34:36	@Brainmage I expected that to be a whoopee cushion with a kazoo stuck in the end.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-01 08:58:34	@ianrweeks @CyclingMikey I fail to see how Mikey there gives other cyclists a bad name? Because he disagrees with you?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-01 09:01:50	@Thunderrage @laureation "Wrong number" "Are you sure?" "... OH NO I *AM* Terry. My mistake. How are you old bean?"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-01 09:02:34	@ianrweeks He specifically states that he does not condone cycling and using a phone. Are you just reading what you want to? O_o
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-01 09:03:26	@ianrweeks Calling out bad behaviour in other road users does not mean he encourages it in cyclists, even if he does not spend time calling
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-01 09:03:47	@ianrweeks them out in the same way, and if you think it does then you really should sit back and think about it for a minute.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-01 09:20:58	@ianrweeks I disagree with him on that point, but I do know plenty of people with the dexterity to ride and phone. It's speed self-limiting
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-01 09:22:32	@ianrweeks I would not agree that using a phone is likely to cause any incident, but I do believe it could exacerbate any.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-01 13:49:29	@EwaSR going through some self flagellation phase I think. This weather is driving my jaw/teeth nuts.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-01 13:50:42	@EwaSR Also, who the hell decided connecting every system in the head was a good idea. You've no idea that your hayfever =&gt; your jaw ache
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-03 06:58:36	@HayleyHeartbrk *fart* and then walk right out again.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-03 07:42:16	@SolOnWheels envious. Some of us are stuck in a box room with no angle on the sun.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-03 07:58:49	@Brainmage This, but take a split second each day of shaving a little bit more to eventually form a picture of a face with a fringe.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-03 08:05:22	@Brainmage I've done it back present day me is short sighted and wants more breathyairspace now.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-03 08:05:41	@Brainmage *because present day me.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-03 08:32:07	@cyclegaz I assume you were trying to go at your normal sort of pace then?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-02 08:27:54	@notlextalionis @fox_sake OW MY FACE IT BURNS.  ( don't forget to let the coffee cool before splashing )
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-02 08:44:53	@cyclegaz When you have to make a living thing sleep outside to accomodate the bikes inside.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-02 11:19:36	@jamesoff so your reply to "Password:" is "Password?"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 08:09:50	@KristianCyc While I agree the enforcement is not warranted, you have technically broken the law by now cycling on the designated side
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 08:10:18	@KristianCyc of the shared use section. I say this as someone who cycles that section twice every day. Still stupid enforcement here though.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 08:11:14	@KristianCyc Correction. "By not cycling on the designated side" sorry, typo there might lead to confusion. :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 08:13:05	@KristianCyc Even in this particular case there is *good* signage showing where the divide is and who is supposed to be on each side.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 08:47:31	@AsEasyAsRiding Sure, discretionary enforcement would be good, but he can hardly complain on enforcement when he has actually broken the law
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 08:48:48	@AsEasyAsRiding I ride that section twice daily, it's clearly signed where there shared split is. He rode along the pavement for a while.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 08:49:39	@AsEasyAsRiding It is
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 08:50:06	@AsEasyAsRiding shared use is bad infra, but if he'd stuck to it rather than cutting across the pedestrian area there would be no fine
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 08:51:00	@AsEasyAsRiding In summary (before looking up the details), you have to stick to the side shown on the signs.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 08:51:21	@AsEasyAsRiding At the point where you can turn, there's no split divider, I think that's the crux of it really.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 08:54:32	@AsEasyAsRiding Highway code rule 62. See also Law HA 1835 sect 72 - quick reference https://t.co/FvuBhyeVvO
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 08:55:35	@AsEasyAsRiding This particular section drifts between segregated and unsegregated, with a raised divider and signs where it is segregated
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 08:56:19	@AsEasyAsRiding Because he crossed that divider before the segregation ended, they're technically right. If only he'd waited a minute longer
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 08:57:21	@richard_je Indeed it is, as is emergency situations. but only for property access iirc. I'd have to check.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 09:00:28	@AsEasyAsRiding I do think that enforcement here, and in this case, is stupid. But the officer looks to be enforcing the law correctly
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 09:01:13	@AsEasyAsRiding Happy to hear otherwise if anyone has any more information :) Video looks pretty cut and dry and law is pretty plain tho.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 09:11:50	@4ChordsNoNet be a backseat driver and make sure he treats other road users well :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 09:35:08	@citycyclists I have a solid explanation in the comments down there (a reply to cyclegaz's comment).
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 09:49:38	@markbikeslondon I've been trying to educate people about this a lot this morning, but he was fined for cycling on the footway.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 09:50:01	@markbikeslondon Since it was segregated shared use and he crossed the line legally it's no different to pavement riding
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 09:50:31	@markbikeslondon I've put a more in depth explanation in reply to cyclegaz on that video if you're interested!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 09:53:10	@markbikeslondon @NeilGarratt That area is all shared use. But some segregated and some unsegregated. Where he crossed the line it was ...
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 09:53:35	@markbikeslondon @NeilGarratt segregated so he broke the law. If he'd waited for the segregation (denoted by signs and divider) to end ...
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 09:54:32	@markbikeslondon @NeilGarratt he would have been completely fine. So many people are misrepresenting this video, and it's not normally like
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 09:55:07	@markbikeslondon @NeilGarratt the cycle groups on twitter to do something like that. Do people really not know the laws around shared use?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 09:55:24	@NeilGarratt @markbikeslondon precisely! Spot on.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 09:55:48	@NeilGarratt @markbikeslondon I totally disagree with putting effort into this enforcement, but it is a to-the-letter enforcement of the law
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 09:56:43	@NeilGarratt @markbikeslondon So yeah "fined for riding on shared use pavement" isn't accurate. It's fined for riding on footway.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 09:58:51	@markbikeslondon Only being so vigorous in my reply to you because you're normally so good about disseminating information.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 10:00:42	@markbikeslondon Check my reply on that video to Cyclegaz' comment (first reply) I describe the area and relevant laws.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 10:01:10	@NeilGarratt @markbikeslondon no doubt about it, I see riders there every day on the footway side of the segregation, doing hefty speeds.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 10:06:55	Building manager here must be psychic.Got up to go and get another doughnut from the break rm and she's at our door with the doughnut trolly
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 11:10:18	@LambethCycling He crossed a segregation line. It's bad infrastructure but the officer is correct in this case.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 11:12:15	@markbikeslondon Yeah, I agree it's a stupid place for pedantic enforcement, but should be being reported as bad infra vs incorrect fine.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 11:13:50	@LambethCycling @metpoliceuk A bad example of pedantic enforcement, but he crossed a segregation line and is legally riding on the footway.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 11:14:59	@LambethCycling @metpoliceuk See Highways Act 1835 sec 72 referenced by the highway code rule 62. If he'd waited a few meters he'd be clear.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 11:17:01	@LambethCycling @metpoliceuk Bad infrastructure but the enforcement is correct.Segregation ends where officers were and is signed throughout
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 12:37:08	@leggydd @NeilGarratt @markbikeslondon I really wish it was. To be honest, I wish it was in all cases. Best for consistancy / honesty.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 21:36:30	@EwaSR seeding the storms.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 20:47:24	Poll: is there a correct way up to eat Pringles? If so, what way up and why? Vote now #pringlespoll
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 20:49:45	I think yes. With the narrow edges *up* so you get maximum flavour on your tongue (flavour tends to be biased to that side) #pringlespoll 
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 20:51:19	On the other hand, @laureation think yes, but narrow edges down so it follows your tongue shape more naturally. #pringlespoll 
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-04 21:02:51	Serious Pringles dynamics discussions in our house. Many practical demonstrations. #pringlespoll Do you pinch or pour?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-02 16:18:51	@laureation one really big apple.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-05 21:46:30	Off to @The_Globe now to see the midnight performance of Titus Andronicus. All excited :D mmm Shakespeare by starlight.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-05 22:29:00	Waiting for the doors to open at @The_Globe so I am stood in a floodlight to show off my purple hair. No! You're the attention seeker.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-06 00:40:18	Interval time now. They're restocking the incense in the burners and mopping the blood from the stage. :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-06 02:16:32	Well that was just excellent. I can highly recommend to everyone to go and see Titus Andronicus at @The_Globe - definitely worthwhile.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-06 02:18:15	On a night bus home now. Might fall asleep on the cushions I took with me.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-07 13:38:25	@nickovdw after-effects of the new transformers movie?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-07 15:33:50	@jamesoff maybe it literally just means it'll be a .csv extension file - ignoring the implied contents. Actual format: plaintext.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-07 15:41:46	@fox_sake Have someone else record it for you "You've reached Xs voicemail. They're not here right now, but leave a message and they'll..."
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-07 15:42:33	@fox_sake Or is it a stupid automated voice where you only supply your name? Hate those. So disjointed to listen to when you ring them.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-08 11:11:40	@n0rm Try not to touch anything as you leave the pool / changing rooms :/
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-08 15:40:19	@mjray Quietly move the cones and debris yourself to obstruct the road instead. Then they'll come and clean it up faster.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-08 15:40:58	@mjray Not seriously ofc. I wouldn't seriously advocate causing hazards on the road :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-08 16:13:39	@mjray That's an even better idea.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-07 07:58:19	@LiterallyGeeked What did you think of it? I absolutely loved it, though I really should have grabbed a coffee in the interval. #yawnface
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-07 08:02:46	@LiterallyGeeked *nod* I knew nothing about it going in, felt it was a good balance of humour and disturbing scenes without too much mixing
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-07 08:07:42	@LiterallyGeeked Didn't believe the people fainting in the audience were genuine though. During hot stuffy daytime maybe, but not that eve.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-07 08:09:43	@LiterallyGeeked could have been some contagious state though. See one person get wobbly you feel it yourself? Good that staff quick on feet
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-07 08:13:45	@LiterallyGeeked And you've just made me look up 'groundling' - what an amazing word :O
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-07 09:00:35	@Brainmage What is this madness? :O  Looks p cool. No idea what's going on in the trailer though. Sim-Factory-line?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-07 10:57:29	@Wangleberry @Brainmage depends on who is giving and who is receiving tbh. I know a married couple with winged-skull motifs on theirs.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-07 10:59:31	@Wangleberry @Brainmage Here are the rings - http://t.co/r6UQblCy2M
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-07 11:09:04	@jayforeman @Wangleberry @Brainmage This is a much better version of what I was trying to say.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-07 14:33:04	@jamesoff does it change to off/on manual commit if you select it? for extra confusion.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-09 11:16:08	@beztweets They have some awful advice earlier as well. "If there is a cycle lane, use it!".  Er, every lane is a cycle lane @RSGB_NE
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-09 11:28:57	@EwaSR http://t.co/jhPvcdYYVG  Best spiderman enemy.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-09 11:46:31	@EwaSR Anticipating some crazy in-breeding before clicking that.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-09 12:50:35	@AsEasyAsRiding If there was any evidence that wearing a skirt actually made me safe, I would wear a skirt every time I rode.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-09 12:59:37	@darkrock They've definitely had a night time finish before, last year ended the final stage at night iirc.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-09 07:16:22	@beztweets Why are there two crossings going the same way within 5 yards of each other? Why does the cycle path just vanish? Why why why...
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-09 07:47:12	@FloNosegbe Sure - wind when cycling obscures most noise. H/phones actually mitigate that somewhat. Also deaf people cycling are not unsafe.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-08 07:13:31	@DuvalMagic Ask claptrap to do it for you.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-08 07:26:05	@beztweets no it isn't.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-08 07:45:29	@beztweets Maybe once a week with twice a day rush hour commutes, and I tend to stick to back streets. Perhaps it's more specific to areas?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-08 07:46:23	@beztweets For me it's a couple of stretches of road running alongside old/new kent road where there is traffic calming forcing lower speeds
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-08 07:47:22	@beztweets it could well be misdirected anger at that sort of infra in the area? Pinch points and humps and then I'm seen as in the way.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-08 07:47:55	@beztweets both, but I wouldn't have replied if I didn't get window wound down and yelling as part of it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-08 07:50:14	@beztweets Ive taken other routes recently and seen nothing like that so tbh I think it's likely a company in the area in brandless vehicles
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-08 09:10:13	@beztweets Seeing some of the other retweets, I may be singled out for having purple hair in addition to cycling? You know othering etc.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-10 08:24:30	@LiterallyGeeked Yeah, supposed to thunderstorm at several points today.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-10 09:01:41	@beztweets Your piece of advice 1 here is honestly the best cycling advice. I'd add, assume that people off every junction won't expect you.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 07:18:21	@Brainmage Cycled in, poured out a puddle from my shoes. Also barefoot.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 07:36:43	Naturally I get some miniscule tiny kickbacks if you get into the game and play for eternity, but that's not the point really.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 07:52:59	@markbikeslondon "Waaaahh we don't want to have to enforce traffic. It makes us seem like the bad guys because everyone speeds already"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 07:58:13	@markbikeslondon honestly the statement reads dangerously close to a refusal to enforce the law. If they had a similar one on shoplifting...
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 07:58:49	@markbikeslondon you could almost guarantee that there'd be chaos in the streets.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 08:38:57	Sounds like I'm a P.I. in this Infocom game.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 08:45:29	@fox_sake amazed.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 10:32:08	Bet all my cycling gear will still be absolutely soaked when it comes to home time.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 10:41:56	@FrogCroakley I've not used the base twitter app since I installed Plume donkeys years ago. It's an acceptable twitter client.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 10:42:14	@FrogCroakley You can find it in the google play store I'm sure just by searching for 'plume'.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 12:03:14	@FrogCroakley Good man. If you care you can configure specific people with colour hilights and stuff too.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 12:11:17	@beztweets gotta wonder what on earth he was doing that led him to crash like that.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 13:12:08	@Wangleberry So you're opening the cat scratch club regardless of your decision?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 13:59:17	@parimalkumar I never knew I had a right to teach other people lessons!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 14:13:52	@FrogCroakley Sounds like you're too popular / active a twitter user to use any third party app then - https://t.co/JUifTwFx60
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 14:14:11	@FrogCroakley I wonder if that was what was causing you to miss people's tweets though using the plain android twitter app?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 14:33:39	@FrogCroakley Gaze upon thy future self young Frog.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 15:44:33	@TfLOfficial I'd report it, because ignoring dangerous driving / near misses / actual collision is the most stupid thing I've heard all year
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-11 15:59:49	@FrogCroakley I don't think I ever ate a Sprint. What is it like? Some sort of bar-form of sprite? Marathons were ace tho.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-10 13:17:27	@mangmangmang Doesn't it pass right through them? Aren't spirits incorporeal?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-10 13:36:39	@RossLydall Suggest they tell their lawyers to stay off twitter during proceedings?

18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-13 08:54:59	@darkrock excellent dude :) how was the traffic?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-10 20:17:51	@LiterallyGeeked eh, I'd always prefer the whole direct truth, no matter how awful it is. Otherwise you take longer to deal.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-15 14:20:17	@laureation Looks like some sort of practical joke device surely.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-15 15:42:54	@jamesoff in 2007 it starts a new event with whatever alt+X is the symbol for. so a bad smily face in most cases.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-14 09:18:00	@UpThatRock cripes! I hope your knee is not badly injured.  Did you take her details at least? It needs reporting to the police as a RTC
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-14 09:38:18	@UpThatRock Be sure to get the whole thing looked over as there could be other damage to chain and axles you're not aware of at first glance
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-14 09:55:08	@highfielder80 Given how static motor traffic is in rush hour, I actually find it easier to ride during rush hour than 11am.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-14 09:56:40	@UpThatRock Ugh - nothing worse than an entirely avoidable collision because someone is careless. :/ Speedy recovery!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-14 15:00:37	@EwaSR You've got a ragin'-cajun there. I can see it from here.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-14 15:05:42	@mbot_spud In most SQL variants if you do any insert ignores then the auto inc value will increase even if the insert is not used.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-14 15:06:52	@mbot_spud Same if you do replace into actually in some cases, or insert on duplicate key update x
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-14 15:08:01	@mbot_spud I had a similar thing when stress testing something, only eventually found it by spotting gaps and patterns in the primary key.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-16 09:33:58	@KristianCyc At least the ban starts as soon as they are released from prison.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-16 09:35:06	@KristianCyc Did you see the PCSOs doing spontaneous free bike marking the other day at that crossing? Obviously trying to save face some.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-16 09:37:54	@allpartycycling If only they'd enforce it though
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-16 10:48:29	@wandsworthnews Surely "A car which was driven through the window" unless cars are now capable of independent movement?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-16 11:03:02	@OmarOakes It's part of a more systematic problem with news reporting, distancing the people who cause crashes from the actual crashes.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-16 11:12:31	@OmarOakes Just wanted to point out that by the language choice there you're putting the focus of blame on the object and not the cause.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-16 11:13:51	@OmarOakes Making the car active "the car crashed" removes implied responsibility from the driver and normalises the behaviour.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-16 11:14:17	@OmarOakes Here's a good discussion on the differences perhaps conveying my point better than I do - http://t.co/wtsXyAzf3G
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-16 11:15:44	@OmarOakes It's a pretty common issue though with reporting of car (and gun) incidents and has been around for years.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-16 11:16:37	@OmarOakes See http://t.co/P2NT06RIYb which quite rightly touches on how the reader is left after reading.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-16 15:20:33	@JamesNonchalant Goes back a few years. http://t.co/F7qpReiGj7 Paraphrasing - "Everyone local hates this, so I'm taking it to the govt"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-17 16:07:08	@Brainmage the man himself obviously. Discuss them in detail, and how they compare to your own. #bollockschat
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-18 08:20:46	@n0rm "Norm. Judge Norm. *BANG*" be sure to do a finger gun at the end as you say bang.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-18 09:56:39	@parimalkumar Probably just before their theory test and never again since.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-18 10:08:14	@Wangleberry Was expecting him to have a line of watches on the inside of his wing there!

18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-21 13:40:47	Anyone have any experience cycling (commuting, not racing) in the days after giving blood?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-21 13:42:29	@darkrock Yeah, I wouldn't imagine any sort of serious exertion / training would really work well for a week.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-21 14:31:51	@mangmangmang I do it, depends on the subject I guess? Cycling, fine. Just walked in on parents naked, probably not fine.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-21 12:21:54	@white_mischief I think (though I'm not certain) that the 0% claim is only their disposables, not the liquids.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-21 12:23:27	@white_mischief it is *very* unclear from the poster though that it's two different products.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-22 08:37:31	@markbikeslondon You have a typo at the end there. You have "decively" rather than "decisively" (I assume!)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-22 08:39:02	@markbikeslondon No problem :) I always enjoy reading your blogs.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-24 07:59:44	@parimalkumar Only if people are also allowed to their own speed traps in the roads.  *digs a pit*
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-24 08:03:17	@beztweets @RSGB_NE Even better. At best anecdotal, at worst, self written with no accountability to bolster own opinions.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-24 11:57:34	Does it still count as mini babybel if you eat all 6 in a row?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-25 14:28:46	@Wangleberry original alone in the dark?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-25 16:14:34	@mangmangmang sounds like a porno.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-25 09:01:30	@xerode I'm less stressed these days by just walking away from things sooner. Or saying "not my problem" and moving on.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-25 09:01:44	@xerode I'm sure I'm less popular from it but tbh I don't really care. I feel better.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-07-25 10:44:32	@xerode I think it's just too hot in general to deal with drama. Bit colder you're not already starting off from feeling uncomfortably hot.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-01 09:17:16	@peterwalker99 Is that because of the structure for the bike store though? It'd be the same for any building, e.g. garage.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-01 09:19:34	@parimalkumar Have done in the past. I use blackfriars bridge now because the traffic never seem to know where they are turning.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-01 09:21:12	@peterwalker99 Affixing a bike rack shouldn't suffer the same legislation as not a building. Also wall hoops / ground anchors should be fine
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-01 09:21:53	@parimalkumar I won't condone that but I do understand how you feel. Be careful :)

18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-06 13:03:29	@daniel_barker because people can consider and edit before posting, so if they send it they *really* mean it. Speaking is more impulsive.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-06 07:42:12	@4ChordsNoNet does that mean people have to slide in on their bums? or stay in continual motion within the vehicles? :D

18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-14 08:17:37	@parimalkumar downside: jangle-jangle-jangle-jingle-jangle. Not sure I could cope with all that every ride.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-14 09:48:01	@JonGracey If that isn't his twitter handle I hope he changes to it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-13 13:38:06	@CyclingMikey Ran into this this morning, the detour is about 30 seconds by bike so tbh I think it's the right call just for public safety.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-13 14:17:01	@FrogCroakley To get any real velocity on impact you'd have to throw it upwards I think.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-13 14:45:51	@nickmurison time to be extra clumsy :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-15 10:49:44	@Wangleberry inheritance money from my gran passing.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-18 16:23:30	@EwaSR but has it been antisocial? Have you all been trying to set fire to your belches in front of GRRM in an attempt to inspire him?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-18 16:25:16	@EwaSR I'm not sure crushingly social is something I ever want to experience from a con!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-19 09:28:59	@badtiems is that "at least 3 days" or "only 3 days"

18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-18 12:42:01	@youreviltwinLP I would think it would be entirely client dependent. I can. Using echofon firefox plugin, rather than a phone though.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-18 12:53:23	@jamesoff I hate when this happens. Gonna have to keep a v close eye on my POW! mug now.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-19 15:38:37	@SouthernRailUK Can you advise as to how many spaces you have for bicycles on your Brighton -&gt; London trains? Would be a Saturday in Oct.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-19 15:43:49	@SouthernRailUK It will be between 4pm and 8pm on that saturday but we won't know until the day precisely when.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-19 16:00:19	@SouthernRailUK wonderful! Thanks!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-21 08:30:31	@FrogCroakley @Thunderrage Screw it. Feed an egg to an Armadillo, then batter that and eat it.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-20 06:18:50	Ugh. Ruptured the side wall of my rear bike tyre. Guess I'll take the bus for the rest of this week then.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-22 12:50:23	@xerode I wish I knew anyone called Gary.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-28 16:37:02	@EclipseInternet er, you guys having issues? Dropped offline on my router and can't even see your site from my phone.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-08-29 19:00:33	@zoeaustin a week for Destiny, a week for the Borderlands pre sequel
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-01 10:02:44	and anyone deliberately searching those out when they know they've been stolen is actively taking part in the abuse.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-01 10:15:51	@iamannaisabel ^5  I feel exactly the same, though more just 'attractive' rather than 'famous' people. Provided they're given freely
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-01 10:40:10	@laureation :D xx
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-01 15:53:40	@n0rm Yep - can even be on a different monitor so you've no idea what just triggered, just that something took your spacebar as a confirm.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-01 10:00:27	Just lectured one of my colleagues about what a terrible person they are for planning to seek out all those celeb pics hacked overnight.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-01 10:01:33	It's one thing to "leak" your own pictures, but hacking someone else's and releasing them both disgusts and terrifies me in equal measure
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-01 12:00:58	@jamesoff Chain your bicycle to it. :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-03 08:22:48	@Wangleberry He's trying to make people uncomfortable as they get ready for work. #coo #coo
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-02 15:47:33	@mangmangmang generally means drivers cutting through residential streets as shortcuts at speed. Like rats running a maze. Vs trunk roads.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-02 15:48:03	@mangmangmang Usually prevented by installing a barrier across the road, because residents will still have access from one direction.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-02 15:50:33	@mangmangmang People who only drive don't understand that cars keep people away from high street shops. They'll adjust in time.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-02 15:55:05	@cycleoptic @aseasyasriding I think that's private land isn't it? So they can do whatever they want really.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-02 15:55:56	@mangmangmang imo it's a step in the right direction. The more we get people out of their cars the better the city as a whole will be.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-02 15:58:07	@mangmangmang Sure - I think people should really be able to do what they want, but we don't have infrastructure to support everyone driving
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-02 16:03:58	@higgsboson10 @citycyclists Only the men though!

18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-08 09:14:03	I'm back from Florida now, and I've been bitten by so much stuff I look like I have a plague.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-09 08:36:10	@Wangleberry I think you need to find the table in the Advanced Rulebook for that one. But, nerdy is mega cool.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-09 12:45:20	@Wangleberry And you!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-09 12:50:04	@Wangleberry @dwylth both PlayStations and both of the XBoxen
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-09 13:10:52	@RVoutspoken How about http://t.co/z8vSxtQfVd
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-11 12:19:05	@KerynSeal4 Bigotry is bigotry and this is just as bad. How's this sound "This is another reason to dislike black people/women/the elderly."
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-10 08:11:28	@ianduhig At least you're not having to resort to Pawn to get by.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-11 08:22:54	@xerode I've seen Van Helsing and Luthor Van Dross before as well
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-11 15:34:09	@mangmangmang Can't stand that. The language choice is so alien. Like unicorns or something. To be feared from afar lest ye scare them!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-11 15:35:55	@mangmangmang Actually I take back that example. It bugs me most that it's mostly men=collective noun, females = collective adjective
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-11 15:36:25	@mangmangmang Yes - well put.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-12 09:40:42	@Wangleberry Not even Guy.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-12 12:27:06	@citycyclists @markboleat Drivers interests masquerading as pedestrian ones. "cyclists and pedestrians necessarily shared a lot of space"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-12 12:27:49	@citycyclists @markboleat Can't see how there's a necessity anywhere unless there is literally no road.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-12 15:43:14	@beztweets waaaah waaaah my parking on the pavement waaaah waaah #selfish

18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-14 08:57:04	@HayleyHeartbrk he's just not trying hard enough. Shelf nearby will always hold a cheese toasty. :9
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-26 09:36:31	@laureation Enjoy your afternoon playing with Lego
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-27 12:39:13	Time themed fancy dress party. I'm the sheriff in these here parts. #time http://t.co/XFDEfZlp1v
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-30 11:18:01	@GAMEdigital Legolas? Well he'll just be plain legless by the time I'm done with him.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-09-30 15:18:48	@GAMEdigital Crossing my fingers so hard!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-01 07:47:18	From the announcement just now it sounds like the buffet car on this train has some cock masseur in today. O_o   oh wait... Croque-monsieur
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-08 11:39:07	@dunos They designed for that didn't they? double light tap the home button slides down the screen to within reach temporarily.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-08 11:44:00	@dunos Ah. Then, er, may I introduce the finglongerer.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-09 11:12:52	@dunos If you never have reason for your finger prints to get distorted, yeah.  Mine never worked because of rock climbing.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-10 15:52:39	@beztweets if Critchlow had any credability before it has been completely shot now. So to speak of course in case he tries to suspend me too
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-10 15:53:39	@beztweets to publish an article as a gloat though, that's the real tell.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-13 07:26:54	@Wangleberry Definitely fewer people walking and cycling today along my route. They've all got to have gone somewhere I guess.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-13 13:31:37	@SueMKnight @CyclingMikey Treat them like all other traffic. Just wait for them to pass. Would you be posting if this was 5 cars coming?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-14 11:07:53	@beztweets "Everyone else should follow the rules, but obviously I'm a better driver so they shouldn't apply to me. I'm safe all the time!"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-14 11:11:28	@beztweets I suppose that would depend on how the speed limiters were designed to work, but yes you're right.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-15 07:59:00	Gonna get a "riding an Emu" costume. Also going to wear it while cycling for added hilarity.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-17 06:54:50	Some rotter has nicked my coffee mug :(
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-17 07:50:21	@CyclingMikey I disagree actually, it depends entirely on the job.  In many many cases, you're right, but not for all.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-23 20:07:17	Quiz night has a practical round with plasticine. "How to get away with murder". We've just covered… http://t.co/Hz5Iq39zap
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-27 10:21:41	@laureation It didn't look flooded as I passed it. No servicemen or anything nearby to be seen to deal with anything either.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-29 12:01:05	http://t.co/CpiSpuEAo7 is the best thing. Also the pumpking suit on the same page.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-29 17:26:22	@parimalkumar It'd have to be up front about the cost. So cost based on the current occupancy could work.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-30 10:02:36	@Jam_sponge It isn't the cost per-se, it's what you get for it that's the trouble. People would happily pay £20 if there was enough content.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-10-30 10:04:27	@nickhide Yeah, that's just an extra slap, but not unique to Bungie sadly.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-01 18:39:01	@JustEatUK Hey - your website seems to be taking forever to handle anything at the moment. Clicks, page loads, order selection, etc.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-01 18:46:42	@JustEatUK Booo - so your site crashed during payment and I've no idea if that order's gone through. Going to order from the place directly.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-01 18:47:33	@JustEatUK Can you ensure you make sure my old order is not put through though? Was an indian en-route to Mr Sweetman in SE22 0AT.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-03 08:42:57	@Paithanoxo Hey - Do you still have that code?
People can't DM you unless you're already following them btw.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-03 08:59:47	@konamibutton I sure do, if you haven't already given it away :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-03 09:40:28	@beztweets Only time I've ever OTB was when someone shoved something through my wheel as a kid.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-04 07:43:16	So, anybody have a #blacksmith #shader code for #destiny from pre-ordering #CODAdvancedWarfare they're not going to use on the 360?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-04 10:10:02	@konamibutton Wow. Amazing! Thanks tons for this. :D I'm following you now so shouldn't be a problem with DMing me.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-05 15:23:22	@parimalkumar Respect will not shield me from tons of metal no matter how much of it there is.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-06 08:34:24	I am very soon going to need a way to keep my ears warm while cycling in.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-06 08:59:12	@beztweets Oooo - I like that. I was thinking just rocking an 80s sweatband over my ears as I choose to wear a helmet.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-06 09:54:48	@Brainmage Actually that'd be pretty cute. Imagine if they had tiny antlers too! Adorbs!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-05 10:11:12	@Neris_k They need bike friendly ride-through baguette takeaways. It'd totally revolutionise my mornings.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-07 12:46:47	@thomas_violence Are these the next films in the final destination franchise?

18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-11 16:18:39	@rocket_panda in this post modern age, are you as happy to have received that email as you would a postal letter gone astray for years?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-11 16:19:31	. @parimalkumar @BuzzFeedUK @cyclegaz You guys will probably enjoy http://t.co/10900TB9Ha
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-11 10:17:19	@Neris_k I immediately have a glass of milk before I hop in the shower, and then see how I feel afterwards. Cheese on toast often after.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-11 10:17:37	@Neris_k But sometimes just a couple of apples, really depends on how I'm feeling.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-11 10:19:04	@daniel_barker All of those can be dispensed with individually. Get rid of them all though and it changes the meaning to "Omit words."
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-11 10:45:50	@Neris_k I don't personally do shakes, but I always have milk and often have cheese, so I'm still getting that protein.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-11 10:53:47	@Neris_k You can always do hard boiled eggs and take them in with you as well.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-13 08:56:53	Oh great. Smoke from my phone's charging port.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-13 11:34:26	Trying to arrange a warranty repair for my @HTC_UK HTC One is not going smoothly. They need me to send photos before they'll help.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-13 11:38:03	Bit of a chicken and egg situation because my phone is my camera ( @HTC_UK ) - just slows everything down &amp; photo won't show much
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-13 12:11:25	@HTC_UK the charging port on the HTC One generated some smoke this morning and now won't work. Has visible burn mark inside.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-13 12:12:42	@HTC_UK So the phone is operational (albeit off to conserve power) but now won't charge.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-13 12:17:29	@HTC_UK I'm not really sure what you'll be able to discern from the photos which wouldn't be better done hands-on.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-12 14:27:24	net send twitter Hey, remember when this was a thing?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-14 12:03:50	I'm rapidly becoming convinced that @baldersdale is a parody account because there's no way anyone real can be so wilfully dense &amp; ignorant
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-17 08:21:07	@beztweets I'm trying to determine who is the most selfish out of that mess.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-17 10:18:38	Watched The Terminator last night. Realised it's now what, 30 years old?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-19 20:17:49	.@walrus_manatee just showed me the Barbie - Computer Engineer article on Gizmodo and I'm gobsmacked that it isn't a hoax. Utterly Terrible
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-21 13:54:10	@walrus_manatee For contrast, I just found out I'm needed working at 3:45am on sunday morning.  " yay "
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-21 14:54:31	@walrus_manatee At home at least. I can disturb Aurie's sleep for a change :D

18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-21 19:30:09	This latest White Collar is amazing. Tech firm renders their secrets unhackable by using bespoke 1970s computer tech to store them.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-20 11:21:12	@jamiesmart I think you're giving them too much credit.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-19 10:42:20	@hobofood Vision on computer screens is like T-Rex eyes. You can only see things when they move. O_O
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-19 10:49:32	@veloevol I also often see satchel bags hanging low over lights on seat posts. How can people not realise!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-21 08:55:51	@AsEasyAsRiding I wonder what the penalty charge notice was for precisely. Bet it didn't include driving on the pavement.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-21 09:16:25	@markthomasinfo If you weren't - I bet sending the letter will put you on it ;)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-25 10:42:53	@FireHazardGames Probably automated. We see dozens of attempts an hour on our servers. We don't even run things like phpBB!
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-25 11:21:35	@job_rot who said that? Must be a ghost, I can't see anyone.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-11-27 11:40:43	@AsEasyAsRiding I guess 3+ will be for "normal London traffic" then.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-02 08:48:10	@beztweets @AsEasyAsRiding @justacwab Can't tell from picture, did she fail to yield at a roundabout or did a driver fail to yield for her?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-02 08:53:33	@justacwab @beztweets @AsEasyAsRiding It's a shame they fail to clarify who was on the roundabout first. Everyone turns right at roundabouts
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-02 10:45:56	@Wangleberry Awww, she'll be just fine I'm sure.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-01 09:38:37	Cycling in this morning, my commute has become a visual cacophony of garish lights and weird inflatables. Must be December.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-02 18:59:56	This original source shower gel (raspberry and cocoa) had #seductive on the front. Not sure I feel #seductive after. More like #swissroll
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-03 10:25:50	I've started using "bag of cats" rather than "kettle of fish" when describing upcoming work.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-03 10:27:19	@dwylth Don't know if it's possible for you but I started riding to work on a bike because buying a new bike was only 2-3mnths of travelcard
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-03 10:45:54	@beztweets Carry some extra weight in your training. About 5-10% of your bodyweight.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-03 11:43:44	@Wangleberry It's not unreasonable to phone the vet to check :)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-03 11:46:55	@dwylth Cannot fault you one bit for that, but there are tools to help you find routes with much reduced traffic / back streets &amp; parks.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-03 12:06:03	@EwaSR This is me, next wednesday. The prospect of it hanging in the future just there is making me sick to my stomach.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-04 11:18:33	@daniel_barker I wonder if Milk would be popular if it was called Malk.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-05 16:38:08	@victohenry this is the worst best or best worst thing I've seen all day. I can't decide.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-09 09:19:15	@wigglebikeshop Do you could it if I'm wearing leg warmers under my shorts? ;)
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-09 16:30:10	@SurreyRoadCops Ah, so you can still deal with drivers when plain clothesed, just not require them to stop right there.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-09 11:37:05	@beztweets You're crediting people with looking at things / reading, rather than just assuming they know what it's about and bandwagonning.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-09 11:38:52	@beztweets At what point does this become too meta to follow?
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-09 12:31:19	@parimalkumar Pretty sure if you run over that guy in a skip lorry, he'll still be dead.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-09 16:26:58	@SurreyRoadCops @parimalkumar Why do you have to be in uniform for traffic offences?Surely "I didn't know I'd get caught" can't be a defence

18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-16 09:46:49	@johnstevenson_x Now you're making me seriously consider keeping a bottle of whisky in my desk for just this purpose.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-16 14:11:43	@Wangleberry I really enjoyed that episode actually. Came straight after I told a colleague "Constantine really needs to be a bit darker"
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-16 14:12:28	@Wangleberry Fine line between watchable for TV of course, and what was feeling a bit 'supernatural - lite' so far.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-16 10:46:35	@Thunderrage needs iOS11 first
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-15 09:18:18	It would be cool if your ringtone played down the line at the person calling you as well as from your phone.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-18 09:58:31	@Neris_k If you don't already, you should log your rides in Strava via your smart phone. Not for racing , just to know how far you've done.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-18 10:17:14	@Neris_k half hour commute this morning used about 4% of my battery? I guess that's a bit hard to guage but seems pretty gentle w/screen off
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-17 16:01:37	@FrogCroakley Rear-left foot. One of those toenails will flip up to reveal a micro-usb.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-18 09:59:15	@Neris_k This year so far I've cycled 2,500 miles and the majority of that is just my daily commutes
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-18 17:13:57	@walrus_manatee Beer? I'mma rush home asap. :9
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-18 17:15:48	@walrus_manatee Hmmm... Ok then.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-18 17:27:19	@daniel_barker Wear some sort of armour. And earplugs.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-19 21:39:22	@UkEljay cheers bud. My team's always got my back but it's nice to have this behind me.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-19 11:03:35	Good mornig so far. Audit investigation finally finished at work showing conclusively that I was not behind some major outages we've had.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-19 11:04:25	Fantastic to have a team supporting me on this and never doubting, despite evidence being presented trying to frame me as at fault.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-22 08:51:39	@Neris_k My cycle ride in this morning was glorious. Hella windy, but lovely quiet roads. Sounds like the trains are hell though

18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-30 10:45:10	@UkEljay My colleague was quick to point out that the hardware does exactly what it is supposed to. The hardware is HA, software not so much
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-30 10:46:20	@daniel_barker For a moment I thought you meant the card game, though that's also accurate there tbh.

18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-31 12:18:22	@StationHotelHG Awesome! Probably see you for lunch then :D
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-31 14:04:15	@johnstevenson_x @beztweets @PhilipGoose I would un-ironically wear these, but it has nothing to do with being visible.
18186373	dmatryx	2014-12-31 15:24:07	@beztweets Ah yeah, I have to cycle that every evening. I do it back up every time I see it but it really should not open into the road.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-01-02 15:49:23	@mangmangmang Carrots can come in multiple colours as well as shapes. Had some lovely purple ones the other week.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-01-06 09:18:21	@parimalkumar That's adorable. My two only do that now if they accidentally get shut in cupboard/bathroom (through their own fault) all day.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-01-06 10:56:55	@daniel_barker Thanks for that RT. I told my boss to buy it and I think he has.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-01-06 11:00:18	@daniel_barker Word is going round it might just be something ballsed up somewhere, but if we get it we'll fight to keep it.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-01-06 11:03:10	@AsEasyAsRiding Everyone knows that trees are the icebergs of land.

18186373	dmatryx	2015-01-27 09:25:19	@AsEasyAsRiding so I guess they've not heard of bikes having lights then? #sigh

18186373	dmatryx	2015-04-10 11:45:38	@jayforeman Slightly, I think. Take a look at http://t.co/0CmbsbV2P4 - page 23 of 28. Compare the 5.

18186373	dmatryx	2015-04-15 11:33:47	@badtiems If you have wireless that reaches you could get your phone to alert you when connection is restored....
18186373	dmatryx	2015-04-15 11:54:50	@badtiems sounds "unreliable" to me. Probably cause to wait in the pub ;)
18186373	dmatryx	2015-04-16 19:43:37	They (the bad guys) keep referring to Daredevil as the man in black. Immediately I think of the milk tray man.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-04-24 06:43:12	@zoeaustin One of the dentists at my practice is called Dr James Wilson.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-04-28 16:13:32	@WINDY_BUTT Bacon Frazzles.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-04-28 16:13:53	@WINDY_BUTT Also acceptable: Salt n Vinegar Chipsticks
18186373	dmatryx	2015-04-28 16:14:05	@WINDY_BUTT wanna bet? ;)
18186373	dmatryx	2015-04-28 16:16:27	@WINDY_BUTT Then chinese. Kung Pao [Tofu/Chicken/Beef/Vegetables] delete as appropriate.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-04-28 16:27:24	@roadcc They should have the police secretly commission one of these polls and charge everyone who responds accordingly.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-06 07:06:58	@4ChordsNoNet Driver told me the same thing a few weeks ago, then pointed at buttons above the door so I could open the door myself.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-06 10:47:04	@cyclegaz It'll be a function of how far she jumped by how often she does it.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-10 10:26:37	We're at Merton Abbey Millls @ Merton Abbey Mills Craft Market https://t.co/DUolWyxUlk
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-10 10:38:05	Turning turning turning #mertonmills @ Merton Abbey Mills Craft Market https://t.co/K0y459yIU7

18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-10 11:00:14	I think this is The Wandle @ Merton Abbey Mills Craft Market https://t.co/hV9wRfZ8pu
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-11 12:55:54	@mertonabbeymill Yes thanks. Visiting was a suggestion from my wife about things we could do on a weekend and it's one of the nicest.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-10 11:16:51	Goat! #goat @ Dean City Farm https://t.co/NwjvBn4T5X
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-10 11:19:28	Nice mud bath on a hot day @ Deen City Farm https://t.co/7dtH9CDiFP
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-10 19:10:46	.@walrus_manatee took a short vid of our sneezy cat https://t.co/UkWpkKyI35 #cat #Aurelius #sneezy
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-12 16:07:17	@mertonabbeymill You may enjoy my wife's photos around Merton Abbey Mills as well, she's better at composition etc. https://t.co/h4mmCZQUXa
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-14 16:06:09	@daniel_barker Olympus. It'll end in Olympus.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-18 16:13:10	Just arrived at Center Parcs. Nice view from my window. #centerparcs #elvedenforest #water @ Elveden… https://t.co/K3qzYUNwXk

18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-27 10:12:35	@parimalkumar I tend to just cycle in the right hand lane from about half way over the bridge when I turn right and yes-virtually every time
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-27 10:13:33	@parimalkumar I see a fair number of people slow down in the cycle lane, wait for the lights-&gt;red, so they can use the ASL to move across :/
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-27 10:14:19	@parimalkumar Actually now I think about it, North and South are pretty identical here, same story and I end up acting the same from it.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-27 10:15:45	@parimalkumar Ah, I'm usually going to the pub just on that intersection so it's not really worth it for me to do that :)
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-27 14:27:33	@beztweets To be fair, if you're not looking for it at all, then finding three is better than nothing.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-29 08:14:45	@CTC_Cyclists Did I just see a pig fly? #omg
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-29 08:17:17	@beztweets Didn't even consider the pun tbh. Just the rarity of anyone being tried for careless driving over an overtake let alone police.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-29 08:18:36	@beztweets Ahhhhhhhh, well I totally missed that. Explains a lot :|
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-29 09:05:42	@daniel_barker sounds similar to the plot of the old game Fairlight.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-05-29 10:55:28	@TruckSimDriver @LeedsCyclists @CyclingMikey @LeedsCC_Help I think the proper sign for #1 is "Cyclists rejoin main carriageway"
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-01 15:53:32	@FrogCroakley Also Optimus Prime.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-01 07:28:42	@parimalkumar Your cat seems to think you're a bad hunter and need training with pre-captured prey.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-03 06:39:09	@CTC_Cyclists The horror of forgetting where you parked yours amongst a sea of near identical bikes ;)
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-03 13:43:26	@daniel_barker Don't try this in an email!
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-03 14:14:03	My lovely wife @walrus_manatee &amp; her team are swimming the channel (with no wetsuit!) to raise money for the @BritishRedCross
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-03 14:14:08	She's been training super-hard for this and you should all sponsor her effort and support a good cause - http://t.co/GGcgmPRFOJ
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-04 07:24:09	@johnstevenson_x @nonsequiturcouk @VoluntaryAnarch @MisanthropeGirl Note their bio "Anti any belief system... that has no basis in evidence"
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-04 07:24:45	@johnstevenson_x @nonsequiturcouk @VoluntaryAnarch @MisanthropeGirl yet absurdly sticking to their guns over 'cars pay for roads'
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-04 14:44:34	@beztweets admission of conscious choice to speed then.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-04 14:44:55	@jayforeman ringing tone?
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-04 14:45:06	@jayforeman dialing tone? I'd use one or the other of those.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-09 19:17:13	Re-watching The X-Files from the start. Phone books! Pagers! Fax machines! #wow
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-09 20:55:23	@mbot_spud yeah just and old old copy. 4:3 tv is taking getting used to again.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-12 07:19:13	@4ChordsNoNet wait 45 mins and update us on the status of the other one. My money is on cancelled also ;)
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-11 08:47:59	@dunos Yes there is. It's polite to organise meetings in your other contact's timezone between companies. Internally though.... :?
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-11 13:33:12	@Conversationsws I've had some let through,and some seized by customs as a potential 'weapon'. Best stow it if you can.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-18 13:55:45	@cyclegaz In a year or two, someone will have an Occulus on under that box and still be working in secret.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-18 09:21:22	@SurreyRoadCops Wear a camera.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-18 09:40:16	@catovitch Probably end up just sharting non-stop.
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-18 16:20:28	@EwaSR Have you seen http://t.co/aPiq6qIYcu
18186373	dmatryx	2015-06-19 08:19:11	@n0rm Use red pen and mark their survey for them. 0/10 - Must Think Harder.
