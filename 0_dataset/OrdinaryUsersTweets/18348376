18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-04 18:50:53	Was happy to see citizen journalists (one a homeschool student) at #DanRiver #coalash spill presser today. #media #foj
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-04 19:47:13	Was just interviewed via phone by @StuartCLT for WCNC's 5:30 news regarding #DanRiver #coalash spill, which is ongoing in Eden, N.C.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-04 23:35:23	@matthewtoffolo Thank you. I'll look at it as I'm able.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 01:47:23	@emcmike It's true. Unfortunately. We're very short-sited, we humans.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 01:50:06	@GaryBlackHC @TVAmy Thanks for RTing my angst. LOL! I'm tired, what can I say? I'm so human. ;)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-04 23:38:04	Amazing: A coal ash pond has been leaking for &gt;48hrs - upwards of 27m gal - the story isn't reaching the national media. #Danville #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-03 22:56:18	@lilmsgs He works in the energy industry in Alberta, BC, Canada -- a city that thrives because of his industry.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-03 23:07:07	"worked to bring the spill under control." Sounds a lot different than the company's press release. #coalash #NC http://t.co/Zk1P1TKBIE
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-03 23:08:57	@lilmsgs Well, he believes himself; he doesn't think he's lying.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-03 23:22:18	@lilmsgs ;) I appreciate a good debate, but I duck out when the name-calling begins. That's a sign that he knows he's wrong. Letting it go.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-03 23:25:30	@CRFRiverkeeper Any word on why it took 24-hours to notify the media, and thus the public?
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-03 23:31:43	@lilmsgs Well, I see him as one of those folks who can't accept being wrong. And he is wrong.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-03 23:37:31	@CRFRiverkeeper Word. Same shit, different day on that level. Boo.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-03 23:40:14	@Heelcorkdork State press release said the spill happened yesterday afternoon. So, typo alert. http://t.co/Zk1P1TKBIE
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-04 00:00:21	@Heelcorkdork No, I meant in the article. First line. :)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-04 00:03:36	@Heelcorkdork Oh, it's so much more than a blog. Working on a documentary. :) And, thank you. Website needs a lot of work.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-04 00:18:29	@Heelcorkdork Let's do it. Say when.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-04 00:25:41	@RichRennicks The Biblical Eden keeps coming to my mind.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-04 00:39:46	@RichRennicks I wouldn't eat fish from any NC river; they've all got fish advisories on them. Drink reverse osmosis filtered water, too.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-04 01:02:15	@IndieQC Thank you! In the middle of a work thing; will post everywhere momentarily. Haven't finished reading it yet! :D
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-04 01:14:34	@AppsTech_NewBus *high five* If I wanted to make money, I would have stayed in insurance! ... talk about a despicable way to make a living.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-04 01:17:35	@dhymers Word! Thank you.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-04 01:18:39	For chrissake, "TrueTwit Validation" is still a thing? Just stop it.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 02:45:20	@wxbrad @DukeEnergy It's still making its way into the river. Last I heard ~27 million gallons of water + #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 02:46:13	@deftlyinane @DukeEnergy Yes, unless the river is cleaned out. So far, there have been no clean up efforts on the river.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 02:46:44	Thanks for all of the RTs today, y'all. :) So many, I can't mention you all. But, I do appreciate it. Thank you.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 17:57:10	I'll wait. Make it multiple Tweets. RT @NCDENR: @Coal_Ash 27 metals are hard to fit in a tweet but I'll try...
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 17:57:45	#NERD RT @CRFRiverkeeper: @NCDENR @Coal_Ash 27 elements, two letters each, plus a space still only 81 characters ;)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 18:01:38	@deftlyinane They're learning about it as they go: http://t.co/bVDMvQxDbO
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 18:04:43	.@deftlyinane Today I pointed out to them that it seems like they're missing some documentation on that pipe. They didn't disagree. #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 18:05:49	@deftlyinane It's definitely at the Riverbend plant. It was mentioned in the EPA #coalash report
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 19:51:51	@BanjoBob4 @deftlyinane Understood. The #coalash ponds were exempt from the Dam Safety program, though, until the 2000s -- '07 or '09.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 19:52:32	@BanjoBob4 @deftlyinane Until 2009 they were only inspected every five years, now they're inspected every two. #coalash #NC
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 20:25:14	(That last tweet http://t.co/mI8jHLVg70 was from a parody account.) #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 20:36:09	@Skvarlatweets @NCDENR @DukeEnergy Tsk. Tsk. (Was funny, though. Thanks for adding some levity to an otherwise dire situation.)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 20:47:32	Been following #coalash since ~2009. I've never seen it so lit up as it has been this week. As usual, Twitter is leading the media charge.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 20:48:19	Though, when I first joined Twitter in Dec. '08, it was ablaze about the TVA #coalash spill. So, there's that. Go, Twitter, go.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 21:08:21	@JameStewartJr @DukeEnergy Larger.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 21:08:51	I have that affect on people. LOL RT @laurelgreen: I'd never even heard of #coalash until I met @Coal_Ash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 15:34:37	.@DavidPomerantz Judging by how quickly they gave the water the a-okay, I'd say the first tests weren't for heavy metals. #Danville #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 15:35:46	.@DavidPomerantz Will put in call now to see if I can get full list. Guessing they have since tested for h.m., but those tests take longer.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 15:38:01	@DavidPomerantz Here's one of their press releases: http://t.co/gvDJgCgCQI
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 17:49:57	.@JameStewartJr Incorrect. The #coalash ponds at #DanRiver are smaller than the ones at Riverbend near #CLT.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 21:21:29	@JameStewartJr Oh! LOL I keep seeing my scheduled stuff come out, too, and I'm all whaaa? Haha.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 21:27:53	Didn't realize how much #DanRiver coal plant looks like the @DukeEnergy Riverbend plant until this @AppVoices pic: http://t.co/PyKy5sI4PI
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 18:06:38	@deftlyinane Well, the plants supposedly had a lifespan of 30-40 years, so ... (I wish this was surprising.)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 18:07:12	@deftlyinane But if they're proactive ...
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 18:08:43	@deftlyinane Well. Recall that dams were under ... crap. They were under different supervision until 2009 in NC. One moment. *looking*
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 18:11:29	@deftlyinane No. I'm blanking. Gimme a minute, gotta search some paper notes. Meanwhile: http://t.co/VIGnQa8lk1
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 18:12:54	@deftlyinane I'm having trouble finding the agency name. It was under commerce somehow, only recently under NCDENR.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 18:28:04	@deftlyinane N.C. Utilities Commission (NCUC), under the umbrella of the state Department of Commerce, regulated the dams.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 18:28:26	@deftlyinane That's from a 2009 article I wrote that's no longer online. What's your email, I'll send it to you.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 23:22:16	@Fishbooom Indeed. Duke Energy did merge with Progress Energy relatively recently, so it's N.C.'s energy monopoly.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 23:23:49	Alright, people. Taking a break. Ping me if something new happens in the #DanRiver #coalash spill: rhi@coalashchronicles.com Pls &amp; thank ya.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-05 23:25:00	@Fishbooom Well, I'd kinda like to thank them for beating the drum for my documentary film, though not really, people's water is involved.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-06 19:55:39	@GaryBlackmon Thanks, Gary!
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-06 20:35:30	@lisayrab Hey. Can't DM you back, but thank you. :)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-06 20:41:07	@lisayrab Ha. I'm not holding my breath, or anything ... but, I enjoy being overly thorough. LOL! Ask Rick T. in your office. ;)

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-07 01:55:00	Sorry, make that 8-city tour. (see last tweet). (Oy, I'm tired.) #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-07 01:59:27	@philperrin1 LOL! I almost said "wrong answer," but you're probably right. Silly. ;) #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-07 17:44:59	@Mr_McQwerty It's all about the Benjamins. http://t.co/z15DpJHvSs

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-06 05:00:35	@RockinghamNews Will it also be published online?
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-06 05:01:58	@RockinghamNews Good! :)

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-11 23:19:34	@asteris Oof. Is renewable energy a focus at all over there, what with the socio-economic issues at hand?
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-11 23:23:10	@asteris Talk is definitely the cheapest options ..........
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-11 23:26:31	@asteris @filmfestivalgr I would LOVE to do that. #coalash is definitely a global issue. And I'm guessing it's an issue there.

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-14 04:53:40	@guysmith001 I like the idea of paying as you go. I like the idea of generating energy as you go too. More things should generate their own.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-14 04:54:39	@tgmee @guysmith001 @bmargirl I see. Thank you for that perspective. Makes me long for Austria/ Germany where trains rule.

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-16 14:56:56	@astrogirlnc @underoak @Robyn780 However, I've sat in Utility Commission meetings where Rogers said, "I'm not going to be for that." Why?...
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-16 14:57:27	@astrogirlnc @underoak @Robyn780 His reason in the mountains was that he's building a house up there; so, he was concerned about the view.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-16 14:58:06	@astrogirlnc @underoak @Robyn780 When he either lied or misspoke about potential wind power on the NC coast, a Commissioner corrected him.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-16 14:58:51	@astrogirlnc @underoak @Robyn780 The NC coast has been found to be perfect for wind energy. I've seen Duke's logo on turbines in Texas. So..
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-16 14:59:12	@astrogirlnc @underoak @Robyn780 It's not like the company can't do wind in NC. Not sure what the current CEO's take on wind energy is.

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:36:02	.@NCDENR Secretary John Skvarla ... welcome, thanks. His department is workin' hard.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:38:03	Skvarla "for some reason, it has been portrayed that we are in an adversarial role with the citizens" lawsuits. #coalash #NCDENR #ncga
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:38:30	Skvarla says he's going to give us "the complete facts." #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:39:23	Skvarla "This issue goes back 100 years. It didn't seem to have a whole lot of interest until 2008." #TVA #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:40:27	Skvarla: In 2008, the regulation of coal ash dams ... resp of NC Utilities Commission, NCDENR didn't have any involvement. #ncga
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:41:19	.@NCDENR didn't become the reg. authority until 2010. Skvarla pointing out that there were no enforcement actions under Gov. Perdue's DENR.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:41:36	(What did I tell y'all: Political posturing.)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:42:44	Skvarla: As soon as he got the job, he "had barely found the light switches" ... then NBC called ... #Storytime #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:43:16	NBC reporter called to talk about coal ash contamination in NC. Skvarla "I didn't have an answer for her. But we were @NCDENR ..."
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:43:43	Skvarla: "I was going to do something about it. There was no hesitation." #coalash #ncga
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:44:25	He promised Charlotte the reporter! She won an award. Now she's in Philly. Holla! Go Charlotte. (How is this relevant, though?)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:45:27	In first month, environmental groups filed notice of intent to sue (60-day notice). Skvarla: "We were going to do what we were sup to do."
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:46:17	.@NCDENR filed four lawsuits, covering 14 ponds, 30 plants.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:47:25	Any claim from enviro groups that they're being blocked isn't true, says Skvarla. Thought they were "on our side of the table." #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:48:05	"I will say that they did prompt us to move immediately, because we did have a 60-day window." Skvarla
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:48:29	Cripes. This is going to put me to sleep. He said all of this at the #NCga #NCenv meeting on Monday. #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:50:16	"Remember, the atty general represents NCDENR," Skvarla.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:50:30	Interesting, bc Atty gen just put out a petition to clean up coal ash in NC. http://t.co/s6UvnNyv36
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:51:08	Skvarla says enviro groups only see one solution: Dig 'em up and move the coal ash ponds. #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:51:57	Skvarla says enviro groups "are now a party at the table." #coalash #lawsuits "Now we are legally aligned ..."
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:52:29	I can't believe I drove to Raleigh for this shit. He whined about all of this on Monday at the #NCga #NCenv meeting. #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:54:36	Skvarla: "Do you realize in the 100-year history of N.C. ... this is the first fine levied against" Duke Energy?
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:55:03	I'm not going to start in on a history lesson or the age of the state, but that's interesting about this being the first fine. #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:55:43	Skvarla: "Our goal is to clean up #coalash, our goal is to protect the environment."
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:56:09	Skvarla: Duke could have bucked the fine and taken the state to court ... but they didn't.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:56:19	@kudasz I was in Eden last night! LOL
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:56:48	Skvarla: "Let's get to the end game of cleaning up these coal ash ponds as quickly as possible." Which means another year of study ...
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:57:11	Skvarla: "The fine is like a grain of sand on a one-mile beach." #poetry #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:57:48	We're back to @NCDENR and "these citizen groups" being friends.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:58:22	Skvarla: "Based on public comments ... we held Duke's feet to the fire even more." #coalash #ncga
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:59:29	@DaveyDavidsonNC Yes, but not in this moment. :)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 17:59:59	Okay, now we're talking about the #DanRiver spill ... @NCDENR "there continuously."
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:00:27	Just a thought: Is this press conference entirely for Rachel @Maddow? Kinda sounds like it ...
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:01:03	Now we get to talk to a PR person for questions.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:02:00	Press pointing out that 3rd settlement was pulled the day DENR found out about the federal investigation.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:02:23	DENR PR: They made the decision to pull the settlement before they learned about the investigation.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:03:02	.@StuartCLT: If the enviro groups were on your side, why weren't they literally at the table?
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:03:54	.@StuartCLT: Is Duke any greater of a customer than anyone who lives along the Dan River? Skvarla: Absolutely not.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:04:27	Skvarla doesn't like that enviros are so consistent about the fact that #coalash ponds need to be dug up and removed from water sources.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:04:40	Skvarla "One size doesn't fit all."
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:05:25	@BozzNC @Coal_Ash You've beat me to the punch! LOL
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:08:34	When NCDENR took over regulation of coal ash ponds in 2010, they asked Duke and Progress for their inspection previous inspection reports.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:08:57	They had to do that because the companies weren't required to turn in inspection reports before 2010. So, asked companies to volunteer info.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:09:16	Guess what NCDENR hasn't gotten much of? ... You get one guess.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:10:13	Skvarla: Dan River ponds are the only ones with stormwater pipes running under ponds. (This is true.)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:13:21	"y'all know we can't comment on the federal subpoenas," NCDENR
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:13:52	Press: "Why not invite your 'partners' ..." to press conference? (For credentialed media only.) #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-16 22:10:49	@guysmith001 @DanRiverSpill @newsobserver @NCDemParty I've brought it up repeatedly. This pre-dates McCrory. By decades.

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:14:10	NCDENR: Don't read anything into that.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:15:03	Why were fed subpoenas immediately received? Have more been received? (No comment on subpoenas.)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:16:06	NO COMMENT on fed subpoenas. Skvarla says he has no history of a business relationship with Duke Energy.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:16:29	.@StuartCLT: "Why do we have to wait ... to dig up the ponds? #coalash

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:19:02	We need more data!! (They've been telling me that for years, pre-McCrory administration. They've also given me shit for asking for reports.)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:19:20	In 2011, I asked for reports and was told I had to drive to Raleigh and pay for them. So I did.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:20:38	"We certainly got a lot of public comments ..." on consent order. (Roughly 5,000.) EPA rec'd ~500k comments on its proposed #coalash rule.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:21:20	NCDENR has to follow due process. (More data! Give them more data!)

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:24:19	NCDENR actually said that groundwater contamination isn't a big deal. We already know that it's contaminated. #coalash #water
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:25:05	Ask people on well water if groundwater contamination is a big deal, @NCDENR. And, what about droughts. Groundwater does matter.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:26:04	.@Jennyjinx Well, I've been on the coal-ash case since way before we were having press conferences on the topic. LOL!
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:26:25	.@NCDENR admits it hasn't tried to stop groundwater contamination.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:27:10	Press: "Why is the agency not enforcing the law?" NCDENR: But we are. (But, they're not. Not even close.) #coalash #water
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:27:37	.@NCDENR said UNDER OATH in fed court that the groundwater contamination is a problem.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:28:27	Press: Why not take them to trial? NCDENR: "We felt it was more expeditious to move through the ... yayayayayayayayayaa"
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:29:17	Press: Explain due process. Did the state have to settle with Duke? NCDENR: But ... Duke didn't have to agree to it ...
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:29:36	NCDENR: Do you want to spent six years in court?
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:30:09	John D. - CLT biz: Wants to know about allegations of bribery. Is there an internal investigation going on?
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:30:38	Skavarla: At this juncture ... No. No internal investigation going on.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:31:21	CLTbiz: What's different about the second set of subpoenas? NCDENR: Read them youself. (Trying to give us the boot now. Last question.)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:31:44	Press: You want us to tell people you don't have the power to clean up the groundwater? #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 18:32:20	NCDENR: Yeah, we do have power to do things based on the level of threat ... (Now we're getting the boot.)

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 19:43:02	Allow me to clarify this tweet (http://t.co/cAdShCzH17). We understand #DanRiver only plant in NC with pipes under ponds. (cont.)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-19 19:43:33	HOWEVER! There is supposedly a plant in Indiana that also has pipes beneath its coal ash impoundments. #coalash #IN

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-20 00:55:48	@laurelgreen Though, the reason I don't drink is because I don't want to drink calories ... LOL Sorry, I'm a PITA.

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-22 01:16:50	@JamesWillamor Very interesting. I can totally see that. As I said, the first tweet I saw from the parody account had me all @@ WHAT?!

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-23 17:38:20	@DrBobBullard You might want to be aware of this, re Perry County, AL's coal ash dump: http://t.co/PCyitinL9w
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-23 17:52:13	@DrBobBullard @NYUPress I know you are! That's why I thought you'd like to know that it was on the table as a solution for NC's coal ash.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-23 17:52:47	@DrBobBullard The fact that it was even mentioned is offensive, given the fact that residents there have been clear: They don't want it.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-23 17:53:40	@DrBobBullard @NYUPress And thanks for the link; I'll spread it around. :) Good work, by the way. :)

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-23 18:54:42	Water is invaluable. "The people" own our nation's water resources, and they deserve to know everything about it.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-14 23:42:13	@FritzColburn @Earthjustice Oh, how interesting! Glad they've found a way to be proactive about the situation.

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-15 03:46:42	@Philip_T_Woods They've known since TUESDAY. This is a blatant attempt to bury the lede. It's wrong ... and lame. And see-through. #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-22 13:14:05	@GoodGreenGuru It truly is. Welcome to the corporatocracy.

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-22 13:33:14	Just realized that I didn't receive @RepMcKinley's usual Friday newsletter. Did anyone else?
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-22 13:59:53	@alex_cox Agreed! And, to be fair, there are conscientious politicians. Unfortunately, they seem to be in the minority.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-22 14:19:49	“This is an extraordinary quagmire that DENR and Duke have created for themselves.” http://t.co/5PYtukvDwl #true #coalash #NCpol #NCga
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-22 15:29:16	@markbridgwood Amazing, huh? Locals told me that the local media didn't even cover the spill for almost a week.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-22 16:07:50	@markbridgwood Maybe. Depends on what happens ...

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-25 22:41:14	Just realized I've been saying NC coal ash regs changed in 2010 when they changed in 2009. Riverbend's permit is what changed in 2010. D'oh
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-26 01:19:18	Political posturing &amp; faux outrage coming out of Raleigh are amusing, hm? It's like 'Real Politics of N.C.' Who will eat their young? #NCpol

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-27 16:17:42	@jmitchem I do. I really miss that place. Can't wait to go back! Hate it about the LGBT discrimination, but, as you said, maybe we can help.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-27 16:26:03	@jmitchem Indeed. I definitely don't need people all up in my sexual life, and don't want any insight into anyone else's! Do what you want.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-27 16:36:16	Been asking @NCDENR to release the names of those on its "Coal Ash Task Force," how they were chosen, and the transcript from 1st meeting.

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-27 19:56:13	@Dennis_Peterson Companies already converting to dry coal ash storage, because they can sell dry ash. The ponds still need to be moved.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-27 20:00:19	@Dennis_Peterson I didn't say that, or anything close. I'm saying cleaning up old coal ash ponds and approving KXL are apples/ oranges.

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-02-26 16:37:59	@StillJohnCA Well, last night on @maddow we learned that the FBI always shoots people with good cause, according to them. #Scary

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-01 02:31:57	@DavidELPC I'm happy to do that. Here's a story from WBEZ on coal ash -near- Illinois (Chicago 'burb): http://t.co/hZznq8wOK8

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-02 17:03:38	@StuartCLT @wcnc @CorrieAHarding @Jkgray111 That's right! Because people deserve to know what's in their water.

Okay. I'll take that; not your thing. I'm roughly their age, so it seems normal for us dorks. LOL!
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-01 13:46:48	Folks don't seem to think it's hard work, but it is. RT @DavidELPC: If Content is King, why are content creators always the last ones paid?

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-01 15:01:11	@DavidELPC Most days, though, I allow myself to just write in a journal that I never edit. THAT is easy. And therapeutic. :)

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-13 20:45:15	@StuartCLT That is super convenient timing. Don't look at the emails, look at the airport ...
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-13 20:51:57	@ESPortillo You might also talk to @worldwidewardo If he can't answer your questions, he'll know who can.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-13 21:17:37	LOL @NCDENR's keeping the politics out of the coal ash issue. #not http://t.co/4yfdsUALdn #coalash #NCpol #hahahaahaha

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-12 17:33:05	@PeteKaliner I've been thinking on this and wondering: Will the costs be offset by the sale of the coal ash to beneficial reuse companies?
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-12 17:33:32	@PeteKaliner I've also been wondering if consumers were given a choice in how coal ash was stored, and if they will be going forward.

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-12 18:06:53	@PeteKaliner I've thought on that, too. Haven't followed the solar news enough in NC, actually.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-12 18:07:17	@PeteKaliner A long time ago, I was told by DE reps that they didn't want citizens &amp; cos generating their own power, for obvious reasons.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-14 02:21:21	@garlandjenna LOL! I make similar goofs. So much coal ash news! It's hard to keep up. :)

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-18 21:40:17	Ditto on the 2nd sentence. RT @hokieADP: DEQ Meeting. I dream of the day when I don't have to read, write, or say "coal ash" ever again.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-18 14:37:01	@underoak It used to get my adrenaline going, when the cops would show up, lights blazing. Now it's my business as usual.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-18 14:45:14	@underoak I know! Was worried they'd put a no-fly restriction on Dan River; part of why I zipped up there ASAP. So much for transparency.

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-21 13:34:13	@markbridgwood Indeed. I know everyone has already asked this, but why does it always take a disaster? *sigh*
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-21 13:29:37	Was just thinking back, 7 weeks ago, when it felt as though I was the only person tweeting about coal ash.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:09:05	Charlotte City Council is beginning a "general briefing" that will include a #coalash update re moving coal ash to #CLT airport. #CLTnews

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:15:24	The benefits: Move 4M tons of coal ash from unlined ponds to "safe, fully-lined engineered structural fill w a wastewater collection system"
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:16:08	"What we're asking for today is to pursue due diligence," @DukeEnergy #DRINK / #coalash at #CLTcc
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:17:53	.@DukeEnergy says wastewater sys at @CLTairport will prevent water from coal ash landfill to penetrate groundwater, surface water #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:18:35	"Duke Energy continually explores beneficial reuse" of coal ash // In 2010, made $10M selling coal ash. #CLTcc #coalash

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:22:51	Let's define a couple things: "Fully engineered structural fill" equals sandwiching coal ash between soil and liners to raise ground level.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:23:46	The "vegetative stabilization" that will top the @CLTairport's coal ash landfill is grass. #CLTcc #coalash

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:35:12	#CLTcc: Part of due diligence (DRINK!) is looking into traffic issues, etc. associated with hauling coal ash from Riverbend to @CLTairport
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:36:30	Charah discussing the dry coal ash stored at Riverbend. It's in piles, covered with grass, ~350 yards from homes. #CLTcc #CLT #coalash

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:40:18	Charah: It's taken about five years to move 4M tons of coal ash in Asheville to airport. #AVL #coalash #CLTcc
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:42:13	Without @EPA making them, @DukeEnergy and Charah decided to line the coal ash landfill at #AVL airport. #CLTcc #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:42:40	Charah: Coal ash has been used at other airports in past as fill where it wasn't encapsulated. #coalash #CLTcc
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:43:47	@CBJstabley @Sharrison_Obs I know. Wa.wa. Complaining does seem to be my magical cure for the hiccoughs, though. :)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:44:46	Charah: There will be a runway built on top of the coal ash landfill in Asheville. #CLTcc #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:46:36	If you're following the 'due diligence' drinking game, you need to take another shot ... though you're probably already smashed. #CLTcc

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:55:28	Yes; it sucks up contaminants MT @freddelmer: will #hemp grow in coal ash?  Check it out with a #hempfarmer or botanist
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:58:03	So, in some other states, the coal ash isn't buried so deeply so it can potentially be mined for rare earth minerals. #coalash #trivia
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 20:58:34	And, there are some lined and covered coal ash landfills that have solar installations on top. #coalash #trivia
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 21:00:13	Charah/ Duke Energy project could create 100 jobs in #CLT. #coalash #CLTcc

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 21:07:05	#CLTcc: is coal ash more dangerous in water than on dry land? Charah: There isn't a req for dust masks, etc. #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 21:07:57	Kinsey: Is it safer to move it away from water? Charah: Absolutely. #coalash #water #CLTcc
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 21:10:01	It's ~12 miles from Duke Energy's Riverbend plant to the @CLTairport, via I-485 http://t.co/OYebJFdXgr #coalash #CLTcc #CLT
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 21:12:10	Dry ash @DukeEnergy's Riverbend plant drains into coal ash ponds; @NCDENR makes them monitor groundwater. It's contaminated. #coalash #CLTcc
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 21:14:47	#CLTcc Smith: Is it too early to tell what savings, econ impact this will have for @CLTairport? (Short) A: No.  #CLT #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 21:16:56	#CLTcc: What I'm really interested in ... is proof that this is the best option? Wants coordination with state/ fed agencies, etc. #coalash

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-03-24 21:36:42	Riverkeeper: Right now the coal ash is on the edge of our drinking water ...but it's not just ash, also includes raw sewage, chemicals, etc.

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-05-28 18:03:30	@RachelsNetwork Thank you!

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-06-02 16:31:11	@BethWellington @EPA @DaveFlessner Well, it depends on when you start counting. At least 30 years, though. #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-06-02 17:06:21	@Kenwardjr @alannogee @MikeGrunwald @TIMEPolitics @chaplinscourage Should we rename it? War on Water Drinkers? War on Air Breathers?
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-06-02 15:56:56	@cappellaj What's been really interesting are the other phrases repeated by people who've never met. Similar experiences nationwide.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-06-02 15:57:22	@cappellaj And, yes ... a lot of people are hurting in a variety of ways. Most feel unheard. So, yes. "it's not right" speaks volumes.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-06-02 15:57:36	@ExposingALEC I did miss the theme. What is it?

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-07-03 16:59:02	I wouldn't call what the #NCga passed as coal ash regs "comprehensive," since that's inaccurate @TimMoffitt #coalash
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-07-03 17:39:30	@beckigray @sistertoldjah It's more like 60 years, but you are correct about NC having more coal ash regs than most states.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-07-03 17:45:52	"comprehensive" is the wrong word. #coalash MT @JohnBellNC: House Passes Comprehensive Plan for Coal Ash Management - http://t.co/4YkEdMCUDt

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-08-04 22:07:21	@underoak @JustinConley Is this the appropriate time to say "I told you so?"
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-08-04 22:13:29	@underoak Gosh yes we do. That's what has propelled me forward. It's not hyperbole to say 'no water, no civilization'. See past, faded civs.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-08-04 22:20:42	@underoak Exactly. Clean, potable water is a major, major issue ... always and forever. :)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-08-20 18:56:44	After more than 5 yrs covering coal ash issues, it's so interesting to me to see the NC media pile onto the issue. Glad they're paying attn.

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-22 20:49:40	Behold! My first @seattleweekly story: Proposed Mountain Bike Trail Has Neighbors Lobbing Threats &amp; Calling the Cops http://t.co/TdYLhbQwG2
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-22 21:21:55	@benpowellwect That's interesting. In the days after the Dan River spill, I asked if NCDENR would be reaching out to TN for advice. (cont.)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-22 21:22:36	@benpowellwect PR rep Susan Massengale was somewhat curt with her response, which was basically "Why would we do that?" (video next ...)

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-22 23:04:29	Oot. oot! Just got the 2-minute warning that the #coalash town hall is about to begin in #CLT. I'm Skyping in from Seattle. Holla.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-22 23:04:43	P.S. I love that the Internet keeps making up new verbs.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-22 23:07:23	Eee. I'm up on the big screen in #CLT. Technology is so cool. (She writes, hoping it won't get ugly later.)

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-26 20:35:04	@melissajonas It's more complicated than that, but I hear you. Actually pitching the story to another magazine with longer word counts.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-26 20:35:37	@melissajonas It really takes a small, hyper-local paper that's actually focused on hyper-local for stories like that. You're right. :(
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-26 23:43:51	@melissajonas I can't disagree with you, and I look forward to digging in to more history, to speaking with more neighbors, etc. :)

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-24 01:24:28	Here's the deal on that: This greenspace's zip code incls most diverse population in #Seattle. The #CheastyPAT doesn't look like the 'hood.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-24 01:26:18	Hoff is asking for #CheastyPAT members to help with outreach. Asking for them not to bias people, though.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-24 01:35:15	#CheastyPAT mbr Melanie Coerver asked to allow public to speak earlier in meetings to respect their time. Facilitator: We'll look into that.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-24 01:38:02	Side note: Why does public WiFi always fail, at least for a while, during public meetings. Is Mercury in retrograde? (Don't answer that.)

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-24 01:56:07	#CheastyPAT member Welch asked abt difference between pedestrian &amp; #mountainbike trails. Hernandez showed several pics and asked ...
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-24 01:56:57	"Do you see a difference between these trails?" Says users would just have to be aware of bikes. Dur. #MTB #CheastyPAT #Seattle

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-24 03:12:27	#CheastyPAT member Coerver wants to "incorporate joy" into the project. (Oh #PNW, you have no idea how different you are. Different/good.)
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-24 03:20:07	#CheastyPAT mbr Curtis is fleshing out the two-trail idea he drew earlier; trying to accomodate walkers and bikers. #MTB #mountainbiking
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-24 03:25:38	#Seattle d og owners, the gauntlet is down. RT @maztec: #CheastyPAT Yes it should not be an off leash area.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-24 03:28:15	#CheastyPAT mbr Couture wants access to wetland areas+ for educational reasons. Coerver wants citizens to be able to walk thru, too.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-24 03:32:02	@waymarkers He said, " ... when the project bombs in three years ..."
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-24 03:37:15	#CheastyPAT Coerver likes the idea of a #mountainbiking trail with some technical aspects, parts that are easy and parts that are difficult.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-24 04:17:48	Tech issues + rapid public comments, you know ... check out #CheastyPAT for all I missed. ... and, good night #Seattle ♥
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-24 04:38:19	@waymarkers It's pretty surprising how much of that there is on #CheastyPAT. Also pretty amazing how much folks &lt;3 that greenspace.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-10-24 05:28:57	Good point. RT @waymarkers: @RhiFionn there is a difference between love and control. Love changes things. Control starts wars.

18348376	RhiFionn	2014-12-05 22:16:57	@EnvironmentNC "here" meaning the hashtag?
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-12-08 00:20:08	@rainafortini @LesleyRStahl Um. No. There are some uses for coal ash, but fluoride isn't one of them.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-12-08 00:33:26	@TymothyWBrown Well, if they're going to move the ash to line the pits it might be more efficient to move to already lined pits.
18348376	RhiFionn	2014-12-08 00:34:08	@TymothyWBrown Plus, the pits where the ash is now are decades old, man-made earthen dams i.e. aging infrastructure.

18348376	RhiFionn	2015-02-18 18:03:21	@AndrewSorensen1 You're talking about the settlement that's just speculation at this point, right?
18348376	RhiFionn	2015-02-18 18:34:57	@JRodReports When did the settlement become finalized? I think that's an estimate from financial docs.
18348376	RhiFionn	2015-02-18 18:51:11	News breaks that Duke *might* have to pay lot of money. Naturally, I've seen too TV reporters say they are paying the money. *sigh* #journo
18348376	RhiFionn	2015-02-18 18:55:05	@JRodReports Thank you for that clarification.
18348376	RhiFionn	2015-02-18 18:56:25	@AndrewSorensen1 Yes, I understand. So, you're reporting on speculation and a line item in a financial report that the @theobserver found?

18348376	RhiFionn	2015-02-18 19:53:56	@AndrewSorensen1 Understood. I was being somewhat facetious. It's more than speculation, but it's not certain either.
18348376	RhiFionn	2015-02-18 20:16:13	@AndrewSorensen1 Touche. Still, "pretty confident" and reality aren't one and the same. Could be. Might be. But we're not sure yet.
18348376	RhiFionn	2015-02-18 20:16:39	@AndrewSorensen1 Any idea if the state will have to pay, too? Thought the investigation was into the relationship between state+co dealings.
18348376	RhiFionn	2015-02-18 20:31:11	@AndrewSorensen1 I've been wondering what would trigger a grand jury info release. Any idea? I hate these hazy dealings. ;)
18348376	RhiFionn	2015-02-18 20:31:41	@AndrewSorensen1 My guess is that the state isn't involved in negotiations, but I'm very curious to know if they're being fined, too, cont..
18348376	RhiFionn	2015-02-18 20:32:27	@AndrewSorensen1 (cont) abt charges of collusion, conspiracy, corruption, etc. I don't think it's any secret NC &amp; Duke have been close.

18348376	RhiFionn	2015-02-18 21:32:42	@deftlyinane I'm really itching to know if the state will be fined, too, et al. Glad it seems the investigation is resolving.

18348376	RhiFionn	2015-04-04 18:32:58	Once I began complaining to my partner about @united's apparent scam, others began speaking up saying this happens to them too often.

18348376	RhiFionn	2015-04-04 19:13:36	@WilsonsWorld I actually don't have a problem w that charge. At least they're up front about it. Do miss 'ol days, though. And the nuts! Ha
