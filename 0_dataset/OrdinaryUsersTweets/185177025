185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-06 21:27:27	3 blokes clad in Athersley Rec gear cheering every pass from Tadcaster. Na then, tha's all Barnsley int tha?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-06 21:29:29	Taddy ending the 2nd half as they did the 1st, well on top. Not long for Aquaforce to hang on.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-06 21:37:37	Free kick edge of the box in the dying seconds for Tadcaster and Milner sent off for Shaw Lane.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-06 21:39:02	Storher off for Aqua sorry. Shot from the free kick heading for Huddersfield.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-06 22:41:37	@mophead_88 Great stuff as always, which I've just read suitably enough on a train home from the football.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-06 22:43:33	Fine work as always by @mophead_88 as he &amp; @JoeBillGibbo take Lost Boyos to #DRFC .Warning! May include me.   http://t.co/1XMDqhozYM
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-06 22:48:14	@mophead_88 I shall keep it in mind!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-06 23:35:37	Home finally. Enjoyed the game tonight despite the pitch cancelling out the good football both teams can play. Result keeps the NCEL open.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 00:16:59	Mirror article says Ched Evans deserves to return to football. Next week they'll say Rolf Harris deserves a new series on CBeebies.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 00:20:32	@angeldelights_x Bit far for me on a Tuesday night, I'll have it on the radio.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 00:25:14	Next game for me is Saturday, managerless Goole v NPL 1 South leaders Sutton Coldfield Town. That'll end well.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 00:26:01	@angeldelights_x  Haha! We shall see :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 00:31:24	@angeldelights_x Probably how it will go. We should have won on Saturday but didn't take our chances. Best of luck.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 12:40:42	@rainedonparade @mophead_88 Donny could always do with a bit of sprucing up, but there are certainly worse places to live or visit.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 12:43:11	@NickQuantrill @rainedonparade @mophead_88 We even have a few who can read now Nick.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 12:51:31	@NickQuantrill @rainedonparade @mophead_88 Keep that up.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 13:35:33	Love this review of the China Rose restaurant from Martin Smith in the @DonnyFreePress . Some great lines in there.  http://t.co/H56lgOCASI
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 13:38:32	Restaurant reviews are usually as dry as the food, but that one mentions waiters employing a zonal marking system. Brilliant.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 14:55:41	@MarcDucrow No problem, it's fine work
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 16:43:51	@nealu_freelance I once got "Is that TSB Bank?" when my address was 18 Crossbank. I misheard, said yes &amp; almost sold them a loan.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 17:50:09	Most of the world's troubles come down to money or religion. Need to move on from profits and prophets.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 12:25:47	Shaw Lane chairman thanks volunteers for getting last night's game on. Volunteers are really the heart of non league  http://t.co/y4b20uPGDu
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 12:27:34	#DRFC fans get a mention in that article. Quite a few there last night. Hopefully a few go along to watch Doncaster non league clubs too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 12:59:01	Digicon SF convention takes place at Doncaster racecourse this Saturday &amp; Sunday. Guests include 2 Dr Whos, Dave Prowse &amp; ex WWE star Lita
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-07 16:42:06	@jonesthescribe @CrapTaxidermy You know when pets look like their owners?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 13:40:13	@Gazz_Long I'm on Watch House Lane.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 14:08:09	@knockernorton1 Me too. They do some really good ads for that game.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 17:41:57	@switzr1 You have excellent taste Mr Switzer.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 18:01:41	@nick_gonzo His accent is horrific. Tells everyone he lived near coal mines in Liverpool, ( a city without coal mines), &amp; has a Welsh accent
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 18:16:31	Little 'Un is watching the 70s Wonder Woman tv show. "Wow, she's cool, but her clothes are silly" he says.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 18:49:52	The acting is so hammy, followers of several religions won't be allowed to watch it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 18:54:57	@glenglenglen @DrMuttley Glad someone twigged onto it and got to the root of the problem.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 18:58:10	@glenglenglen @Shilpabee Good stuff. Do I need to buy a hat?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 19:00:35	@JaimsVanDerBeek Space Mountain, closed for repairs.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 20:50:18	@DrMuttley Won't look stupid at all, I think the card is just a failed joke. I'm certainly struggling to find an obvious one.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 20:53:53	@switzr1 Rovers last week had half price tickets, shut half the concessions and probably lost out because of people not queuing to buy.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 20:56:23	Last RT from @TheFootballPink , go buy one. It's a beautiful thing. http://t.co/BBGWZJEqiP
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 21:30:07	@DrMuttley @Nenpod Maybe due to that bit of the film being a bit slow?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 04:46:13	@Steve_Dangle From his picture, he does an excellent Peter Griffin impression.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 17:09:40	Incredible that it's Thursday already. Hardly stood still all week while feeling like I've done nothing. Quieter tomorrow before football.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 17:16:21	@mymoodup It's worth a go. Megaslam usually put on more traditional shows than most British promotions. A few good names on there too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 17:25:26	@mymoodup As always.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 18:48:26	This 70s Wonder Woman show makes the 60s Batman look like serious drama.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 18:57:03	@jon_cox2109 Definitely, I haven't seen it since I was a kid and quite enjoying it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 19:22:02	@rainedonparade Excellent, though for accuracy it should arrive 10 minutes too late for the birthday.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 20:07:44	@jtlovell1979 It was 1986, when being rich and spoilt was the dream.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 20:09:39	@jtlovell1979 Even Back to the Future had the same ideal, when Marty McFly sorts out his family, they end up rich &amp; he has a big car.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 20:14:04	@jtlovell1979 Ferris Bueller is fun, but it's an 80s Catcher Un The Rye. He thinks he's a rebel but is actually a bit of a tosser.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 20:16:23	Tweets of the Image Comics announcements are making me a bit giddy.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 20:20:58	Warren Ellis working with Jordie Bellaire for Image. If I send my bank details you can just take what you need.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 20:34:58	@DanvilleDashers @switzr1 That's fantastic, a few sports teams over here could learn a lesson in fan engagement from that.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 20:37:18	@BenMcAleer1 We'd surely be better off banging Mr Taylor's head against a wall.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 13:34:40	A police car crashed into a tree up the road yesterday. I'm hoping the tree was arrested for leave-ing the scene of an accident.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 13:43:35	@Gazz_Long I grew up on Springwood Road, so just round the corner.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 13:55:32	Decent card for the Megaslam Wrestling 6th anniversary show at Doncaster Dome on Feb 6, El Ligero, Saraya Knight, Frankie Sloan, Paul Malen.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 13:56:38	The show also has an appearance from World Of Sport legend Johnny Kidd &amp; a steel cage match for the title.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 20:42:20	@switzr1 @DanvilleDashers Best deal we get here after delayed/cancelled games is reduced prices on the replay. Impressive from Danville.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 20:45:54	@DrMuttley Bit confused myself. Only Star Wars gag I can see are the snail shells looking like Leia's hair &amp; Luke/Leia love awkwardness.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 20:46:51	@Shilpabee @glenglenglen I've needed a new look since about 1996 :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 20:48:57	@switzr1 Very good. I think our sports teams have a money grabbing culture usually. Rare that fans are looked after.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 21:00:04	@switzr1 2 website writers came with me, their first visit here and couldn't get food or a beer at halftime because of the queues.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 21:02:38	@LlandudnoJetSet Accompanied I hope by a sign saying " Jesus saves, Rooney knocks in the rebound. Join us on Super Sunday"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 21:09:25	@Nenpod @DrMuttley Ah! That's it. I was even thinking Admiral Akbar with the eye stalks in an effort to get it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 21:11:10	@switzr1 Normally fine at Rovers, but shutting half the bars just doubled the queues. Did you see the blog from Saturday?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 21:16:42	@switzr1 No it was another one. 2 blokes who go to a different game every week and I showed them round Doncaster. I'll send the link.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 21:18:27	@switzr1 Here you go, shows a few bars in Doncaster &amp; scary pictures of me.  https://t.co/K9yK35rOEF
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 21:32:33	@switzr1 Worth a look through that site, it's really good, travelling around different grounds.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 21:33:41	@switzr1 They were great. All day beer and football.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 09:22:27	Overhead several times on the school run -"Ooh, it's blowing a gale". Of course it is, gale force winds generally do.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 22:19:56	Channel 4 have a show, 'Sex Party Secrets' on at the same time as #bbcqt . Wonder which one features the most politicians?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 11:11:45	Watching TNA Impact in its new home, a new home which appears to be short on light bulbs.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 11:12:15	@rainedonparade No problem, looking forward to reading it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 11:18:05	@AFHStewart It highlights the fine line between having a penis and being a complete cock.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 11:25:59	@Laurencereade I was told last week I looked like Jeff Bridges. I thought "But he's old an grey and...oh...bugger"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 16:12:10	Every planning application for Doncaster recently includes a gym. It seems obligatory. My next sandwich will have cheese, pickle &amp; a gym
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 16:14:48	@jonesthescribe Of course.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 16:26:18	I see after the fine long term sign ups of the defence, #DRFC have taken on a new hashtag until the end of the season, #MyLocalTeam
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-08 16:28:32	Like most marketing hashtags, it doesn't quite work. For plenty of #DRFC fans, as with most clubs, it's not their local team.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 09:14:14	@TheFootballPink No problem, a good read as always. Look forward to issue 7.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 12:09:31	Watched the first half of the new Impact. The actual show is very good but production values are poor. Lighting is dull &amp; the sound poor.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 12:11:07	One key moment was embarrassingly missed with the camera dropping to show several sets of knees instead of what was going on.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 16:55:20	@markusparkus75 @jonesthescribe I might be able to stretch my drinking arm...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 16:57:27	@markusparkus75 @jonesthescribe OK , I'll nip in for a while.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 17:10:26	@jonesthescribe @markusparkus75 You could always have a pint of lo-fat beer.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 17:14:49	@jonesthescribe @markusparkus75 Half a Stones you say? Ok, and 2 pints of John's &amp; a bag of plain please barman.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 17:22:52	@markusparkus75 @jonesthescribe If Oldham Athletic don't try to sign it, beer is OK.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 17:33:07	@jonesthescribe It won't be boring when you're 80 &amp; jog over to visit our beer guts in the nursing home.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 19:16:57	Train into town &amp; a notice in the station said East Coast are operating dry trains tomorrow. On football day. Good luck with that.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 19:19:02	@phoenixevents4 Is it still the same door time?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 19:59:27	@Gazz_Long Get it early, trains are dry from 1030.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-10 18:22:26	Home from the football. Left my phone at home, surely more comfortable to have left an arm.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-10 18:24:14	Decent game today despite the horrendous wind. New look Goole team lead early before Sutton Coldfield came back to win 2-1.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 22:34:49	Several live music venues in Doncaster, Friday night and there's 1 covers band. I keep being told the local music scene is thriving.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-10 00:10:40	Take 1 pic on your phone with friends in a pub and some photobore tells you which add on lens you need for 30 fucking minutes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-10 00:11:40	I'm in Goole tomorrow, I'd love to see him make that spectacular.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-10 00:13:22	"You need a Samsung 1380p this that and the other" You need to bog off mate.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 23:25:59	@markusparkus75 If you're still in town, bumped into an old mate and watching the covers band in the Woolpack. They're not bad.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 23:37:53	@markusparkus75 Ok, might see you next week.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-09 23:39:32	Just saw a covers band do Nine Inch Nails followed by Pulp. I'm confused.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-10 00:41:18	Old girlfriend asked me to dance. Explained that I'm married now and could never dance anyway. She remembered.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-11 09:14:11	Was going to stroll along to a Sunday League game this morning but had my fill of the wind yesterday. Feel like I've been sandblasted.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-11 13:21:53	Finally! A female official for @footballspoon at a windswept Bridlington Town v Staveley MW.  http://t.co/Td8ok6ThIP
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-11 13:24:44	@footballspoon Looking forward to it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-11 14:17:23	Exciting start to the Rome derby, Lazio with 15 smoke bombs &amp; Roma reply with 12 dives.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-11 15:26:54	Totti taking a selfie after scoring the equaliser. It's rare that people that old can work modern technology.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-11 16:28:25	Politicians marching for freedom of speech? Kettle them in a side street and start waving truncheons. What's good for the goose...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-11 16:42:58	Little 'Un asked to watch " Doctor Wu". Have to search for some cheap knockoff Chinese timelord dvds.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-11 16:46:26	@HobosGhost Haha! Of course.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-12 19:19:18	"And the Ballon D'Or goes to....Qatar - oh, hang on, wrong envelope"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-12 19:21:52	Amazes me how people still take something seriously with the words FIFA and Vote involved.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 00:39:16	Napped to stay up for the Oregon - Ohio State game. Have an urge for breakfast and coffee. Not going to know what day it is for a week.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 00:45:25	If rumours of a Randy Savage WWE Hall of Fame announcement tonight are true, then surely Raw opens with a poem from The Genius.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 01:45:38	Looking like a basketball score tonight. Incredible the speed the Ducks play at.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-12 11:27:20	@jonesthescribe Britain living on 9000 calories less than last week.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 11:34:40	Last rt possibly says more about where Premier League football is at than the demise of fanzines.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 11:37:33	For every Red Or Dead going there are several new fanzines popping up. In the last year I've seen new ones at Barnsley, Newcastle &amp; Torquay.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 11:39:02	Football exists &amp; thrives well beyond the rarified atmosphere of Old Trafford and the like.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 11:40:26	@TheIndyCorner @wsagfanzine One of the famous ones. Annoys me that because a Man U one packs up, all fanzines are automatically dead.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 11:46:59	@TheIndyCorner @wsagfanzine We might get to beat you down at Doncaster in a few weeks :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 11:54:28	@TheIndyCorner @wsagfanzine Bristol City. Should've beaten them at home so probably blown it. We've a good away record though so who knows.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 12:34:51	Game off tonight between Shaw Lane &amp; Bridlington. Surely Brid would feel at home on a pitch full of water and sand?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 12:43:35	@knockernorton1 Irritating that many are treating it as the death of all fanzines when it's far from the truth.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 12:51:41	@knockernorton1 Plenty and new ones all the time, even things like Stand &amp; Football Pink are very good &amp; seem to be thriving.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 14:07:26	Quick shopping trip topped off in the Marketplace Alehouse &amp; Deli. Feta stuffed peppers &amp; a pint of Toolmaker's Toffee Hammer. Gorgeous.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 14:08:38	Well, I say shopping, boxers and comics. Just the essentials.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 14:13:21	Found nice copies of Dark Horse Presents 39 &amp; 40 with @Ron_Randall 's Trekker on a market stall. Really pleased, only £1 each too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 15:06:11	Lunchtime snack was sexy. http://t.co/NUqMfCD3J1
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 15:08:47	In town again tomorrow, so I reckon @MarketplaceAles needs another visit.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 16:14:21	I see in an effort to create a "singing section", #DRFC have made the South Stand unreserved seating. All well and good &gt;
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 16:16:14	However #DRFC have also removed the cat b section in the north west where a group have organised themselves singing recently. &gt;
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 16:17:17	Sing when we want? No, sing when we tell you, where we tell you. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 16:19:45	I'll be listening to #DRFC on the radio later, however if I fancy singing I'll have to move from my favourite chair to the approved seating
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 16:42:21	@SouthsideWE Watching both and get far more enjoyment from them than the big boys.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 19:48:12	@angeldelights_x You too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 19:51:11	Kids in bed, #DRFC at Bristol City on the radio, couple of beers lined up. Stressful couple of hours ahead.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 19:52:58	"Doncaster being patient before sending it long", in other words, piss about a bit then hoof it. #properfootball
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 20:10:02	@markusparkus75 @TheMrsJonesy Just not Lena Dunham's book :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 20:23:32	1-0 Bristol. JET with the goal.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 20:25:17	@neillyfabi Almost certainly.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 20:35:06	#DRFC 1 down at halftime but don't seem out of it. Couple of shots gone close at the end of the half.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 08:21:09	Little 'Un is a maths wizard, "If I had 10 apples &amp; ate 6, what would I have?"
"4" I said
"No, I'd have tummyache"
Thinks he's funny too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 08:33:51	Snow on the news yet not a cloud in the sky over Doncaster. "Weather Bomb" again is it?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 16:11:20	@PUDP1E Maybe you couldn't see The Wood for the Trees.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 16:44:54	@VoodooF365 It's not that daft, he's played around that level before and in that part of the country. He was at Frickley for a while.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 16:46:21	@VoodooF365 Probably is partly, but he's not a bad player.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 16:50:29	Little 'Un watching a 1940's Captain America serial. Shouted him for his tea. "But he's trapped in a box &amp; the baddies have set  it on fire"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 16:51:19	@BeerNBodyslams Sounds good to me.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 16:53:16	@thalestral Sports comics used to be huge in the UK. Every comic was sport or war stories. All disappeared now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 16:56:23	@thalestral A new football comic surfaced 4 or 5 years ago, based on a newspaper strip but didn't last long. Maybe no real market for it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 16:59:18	@thalestral A couple of Roy Of The Rovers collections have been released over the last few years, aimed for Christmas.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 17:02:22	@thalestral I think pricing is a problem. 2000AD is £2.95 a week. Would kids pay similar for a weekly sports book?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 17:03:51	@BeerNBodyslams Look forward to it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 17:05:28	@thalestral Quality of stories is a problem too. The old style comics would be dated now &amp; Football has never really seen good fiction.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 17:06:35	@thalestral I'm more surprised a US indie hasn't done a Baseball book. There are great stories on film &amp; it works with Manga.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 17:08:32	@thalestral I'd buy that!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 20:52:19	If #DRFC win tonight there's £350,000 available in the next round. Just think of all the new hashtags we could buy with that.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 20:55:55	@MJ_Lethal Haha! Worth a try!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 21:01:40	"232 from Doncaster...not the biggest crowd" says the commentator. 400 mile round trip on a Tuesday night, that's not bad. Idiot. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 21:04:38	#DRFC fans at Bristol are great, but my Wife is in the bath. I've swapped a wet, naked, attractive woman for Micky Walker. That's dedication
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 21:21:00	Shouting at the radio as #DRFC have Bristol on the ropes for a bit. Perfectly normal behaviour....
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 21:23:21	#DRFC have every striker since Colin Douglas on for the last 10 minutes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 21:24:45	2-0 Bristol. Concentrating on the league &gt; staring at Sam Allardyce. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 21:28:52	Last throw of the dice for #DRFC as we search furiously for ineligible players.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 21:39:57	Of course people blame Kyle Bennett's 90th minute miss for losing the tie. The other 89 never count do they? #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 21:43:35	@MarkMark1952 Of course. Doesn't stop the hard of thinking looking for a scapegoat though. It'll be the Dickov out brigade before 10pm.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 21:45:20	To top off a rough night for Donny Football, @BRODSWORTHWAFC go down 4-0 at @Ollertontown_fc in the CMFL Floodlit Cup.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 21:46:18	@MarkMark1952 They'll want to win, especially with a few quid available in the next round.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 21:46:45	@finderz4 @BRODSWORTHWAFC @Ollertontown_fc Don't know, haven't heard anything.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 22:11:50	@Scotty_SL Pretty much!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 22:39:08	@angeldelights_x Sounded like Emmanuel-Thomas had a great game.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 22:40:34	@angeldelights_x He was on loan with us a couple of years ago, really good player.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 22:42:42	@angeldelights_x Poor you, having to suffer 90 minutes of Sam Allardyce.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 22:43:40	@angeldelights_x Hope you get through.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 22:46:34	@angeldelights_x That's the only problem. We've had a couple of cheap deals at home recently. Won't last long though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-13 22:48:48	@liamhoden Of course he knows he's hungry, he had to buy him dinner.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-15 03:36:55	@Rosiehalokings He prefer to see his Dad suffer in the middle of the night :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-15 03:43:09	@Rosiehalokings He'll probably turn out to be a huge Angels fan, just to keep it going for the summer.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-15 14:05:37	#DRFC sign Stephen Bywater who along with Jim Proudfoot are the only people in football named after Hobbits.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-15 14:45:14	Doncaster Council up for most improved in a local govt. awards. Amazing what happens when you get a Mayor who isn't in the bookies all day.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-15 16:11:32	MLS unveil the new album from The Fall (pic from @GothamistDan). http://t.co/4CohrLkvs8
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 17:20:18	@thalestral @molcher There used to be a future sport story in 2000AD. I forget the name but it was very Rollerball-ish.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 17:25:12	@molcher @thalestral That's the one. Showing my age by remembering a 20+ year old story...then forgetting the name.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 18:11:07	Lucha Underground catch up. Some of the in ring stuff is obscenely good and it's Wrestling as spectacle, an event, as it should be.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 18:17:46	Big Ryk just clotheslined Mascarita Sagrada. Surely there's an American Society for the Protection of Mini Luchadors?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 19:21:24	.@SouthsideWE return to Sheffield at Corporation with @facdaniels &amp; @FrankieKazarian .   https://t.co/q3gNENxjLG
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 20:07:51	@BeerNBodyslams Spot on that. Recently saw Ospreay v Uhaa in a classic. What did we talk about on the way home? Grado v Flex Buffington.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-14 20:54:33	Aaked why my Wife sends me to the shop in the dark and cold. "You're a big boy" she said. Not in this weather I'm not.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-15 03:28:14	Baby awake at 3am. I think he wants to listen to the Leafs game. #TMLtalk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 09:34:16	@OrientMeatPie They seem to scrape breakfast from a damp rock rather than make anything.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 09:36:19	@OrientMeatPie I'm a veggie but it makes want a bacon sarnie.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 09:44:26	Not sure if some of the #DRFC photos this morning are fans buying season tickets or if there's been a mass escape at the prison.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 09:46:01	You wouldn't want that last lot sat near the family stand would you?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 09:49:57	@Pearcey149 Does my head in too, but if it keeps marketing people off the streets...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 09:56:09	Might go &amp; get some revenge this morning, head to #DRFC , walk up to someone holding that #MyLocalTeam board &amp; ask "Is that the programme?"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 10:22:26	The wonderful @rainedonparade has a crime novel out today, On Laughton Moor, only £1.99 on Amazon. Go buy it!   http://t.co/HtNQcGYH44
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 10:53:59	Of to Tadcaster tomorrow for their FA Vase tie v Brocton. Possibly 5 NCEL teams in the last 16 shows just how good that league is this year.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 10:56:27	@Rich_Colby You definitely should have a go. Can be hard work but write something every day and stick at it, it soon comes together.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 11:03:31	@rainedonparade No problem. Well done, hope it sells a ton.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 11:05:52	@Rich_Colby It's worthwhile, however long it takes. I've got a comic out this year, pretty exciting when you start seeing the artwork.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-15 13:23:24	Enjoying the Roddy Piper interview with Vince Russo. If Russo wasn't skype-ing it in, Piper would have decked him by now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-15 13:25:43	Piper "Why did you do a,b &amp; c?"
Russo "Bro, it wasn't me bro. Bro."
Piper chuckles and picks up a coconut...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-15 13:55:55	@jonesthescribe I keep seeing weather forecasters not knowing the difference between weatherbomb and hyperbole.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 13:04:43	Worst hygiene ratings in Doncaster food places. On the upside, they all do a damn good rat shit panini.  http://t.co/QbF9SJF7nK
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 13:16:48	Result on a book stall in the market today. A stack of Image #1's for 50p each. Hello ebay, here I come.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 13:30:17	Quick pint of Sky's Edge New England &amp; grabbing a baguette in @MarketplaceAles , gorgeous.  I think I might move in.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 14:24:38	@BeerNBodyslams £20 for kids, must be with an adult, so at least 50 quid. Do fans have to sell being hit with that?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 14:33:52	@BeerNBodyslams Just saw the line up on the facebook page. Seems more than a hint of a scam, certainly wouldn't catch me going.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 14:35:58	@BeerNBodyslams Southside run Sheffield the following night at less than half the price.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 14:42:43	@BeerNBodyslams I remember him from a UK wrestling doc a few years ago. He was sat with his Mum who said wrestling kept him out of prison.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 14:47:12	@BeerNBodyslams He used to work small shows for years and maybe All Star. Never a big name.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-15 16:36:31	Watching NJPW/CMLL Fantasticamania. I love how the Japanese describe a sold out show as Super No Vacancy.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 15:15:44	Defoe being picked on? By Canadians? "So you want to come to Tim Hortons eh? I'm buying", "Leave me alone you evil bastards"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 15:16:56	Probably a sign Defoe wouldn't settle when at his 1st press conference in Toronto he said he was pleased to be in America.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 15:34:02	Seeing "Zeki Fryers signs with Rotherham" makes me think they're being sponsored by a chippy in Rawmarsh.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 15:49:38	@cattletruck142 Unfortunately so, it's a shame all the Donny teams don't really have the funds to keep up.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 15:53:34	They'll never score a pen in those heels. "@drfc_official  Here are our Penalty kick scorers... http://t.co/NlWiAD4beN "
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 16:26:46	@markusparkus75 Well in some countries we'd now know who was going to win the election in May.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 16:29:56	@markusparkus75 Could well be. Unless they are expecting a big fire or police strike.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 16:32:45	@markusparkus75 I think they did with the Gulf. I remember they sent alot of TA over there, a couple I worked with at DRI went.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 16:36:37	@markusparkus75 Well I'm off for a pint before I get called up as an air raid warden or something. You out later?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 16:39:18	@markusparkus75 May see you there then.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 16:42:18	@markusparkus75 Well I'm about to have a walk to the Plough for a bit then I'll head round to the Pin for one.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 16:44:54	@mophead_88 Yet still way behind Dave Whelan for most offensive thing in Wigan.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 16:45:34	@markusparkus75 I'd rather take my chances with a bear.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 20:44:57	Always fun taking a pic with a flash in an enclosed area. Everyone thinks you're a Men In Black operative.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 21:21:17	In Cask Corner, favoured watering hole of @mophead_88 &amp; @JoeBillGibbo
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 21:22:35	There are elderly men tuning guitars on stage. Serious threat of Jazz or arthritic Blues.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 16:47:37	Stroll into town for a pint or two. In Tadcaster tomorrow so need a head start on @AdamAcer1978 and the TSC.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 00:22:23	Especially pleased to meet @benbooth493 and his incredibly beautiful Wife. The kind of people that make your day.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 17:25:32	Great stuff "@drfc_official: PENALTIES: Rovers legend Jan Budtz is being warmed up by a future star #MyLocalTeam http://t.co/3fBodVf5FY"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 17:31:31	2 blokes in the pub talking loudly about unions. Recognise 1 from tv. Should loudly say "Solidarity brothers" &amp; find out who he is.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 17:32:31	Always a chance mind that he's nobody and I'll look a right pillock.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 17:40:36	@dan_kitching How much without giving them a kidney?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 17:44:05	@switzr1 Nah, this lot can sing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 17:48:45	Snow forecast for the game tomorrow. Orange balls! Not sure what colour they'll have on the pitch though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 17:50:02	@switzr1 Heard a review of it on a podcast, they called it the best 1 hour tv wrestling show ever.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 17:53:25	@switzr1 I'm hoping someone puts it online. Mauro Ranallo is on commentary if you know him.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 17:54:40	@kev_mcclone @drfc_official Is it? That's brilliant, he'll remember that for a long time.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 17:57:14	@switzr1 Ha! Not sure who's on, I know it's a mix of old and new matches.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 18:04:43	@peter27afcb Pay a visit to the Bridge Inn near the train station, big Millers fan runs it, walls covered in football scarves. Good place.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 18:09:45	@peter27afcb It's pretty much opposite the station, all a 5 minute walk from the ground.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 18:12:47	Classy trio came in the pub. "I never had sex wi' that cunt" said the woman. One bloke replied "Ne'er mind love, come outside for a spliff"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 18:20:47	@switzr1 And the Oscar for Doncaster joke of the year goes to...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 09:49:46	Football day, as well as cheap tickets at #DRFC v Barnsley, there's a big chance of 3 points for Armthorpe @thewelfare v @ParkgateFC .
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 09:51:59	Also around Doncaster today, @RossingtonMain v Winterton, &amp; derbies at Thorne Colliery v @BCollieryfc and Askern v @BRODSWORTHWAFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 18:40:09	@mophead_88 Never safe in Rotherham! Nice ground though. Pay a visit to the Bridge Inn near the train station, covered in football scarves.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 18:42:03	@mophead_88 Landlord at the Bridge Inn is a big Millers fan, nice bloke though I forget his name.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 19:00:31	@footballspoon I am yes. Looking forward to it. Snow forecast during the afternoon so don't forget a hat for the spoon.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 19:02:23	@footballspoon Still 1215 ish at Leeds station?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 19:12:20	@footballspoon Yes, just replied.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 19:21:15	@footballspoon See you tomorrow. Be prepared for Captain Chickers and the Tad Army. Loads of fun.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 19:40:04	The sweary loons have left the pub. Just me &amp; @markusparkus75 left. Not sure what entertainment we provide. Being cynical &amp; sarcastic maybe.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 22:58:04	Hipster Val Doonican playing the Masons Arms tonight. http://t.co/hFCdoGX2zn
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 10:36:19	@BCAFCBH That's where I'm going. Their fans always make a noise, so an expected 600+ will be a good atmosphere.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 13:41:58	In Tadcaster. Lovely looking little town, dominated by the imposing John Smiths brewery.  Why have I never been here before?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 13:45:03	@markusparkus75 I was clear as a bell this morning. Now downing one a stone's throw from the John Smiths brewery.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 13:46:10	@knockernorton1 Just me now,sadly @footballspoon is down with a touch of something.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-16 23:03:38	@mophead_88 @JoeBillGibbo Winner winner, cheap vegetarian chicken dinner.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 00:20:11	Home from a damn good night out with @markusparkus75 and some wonderful people including John &amp; his band with no name.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 00:24:09	Best thing tonight, after a leaky bladder situation, everyone just asked about bladder cancer, rather than "You pissed yourself mate"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 00:30:06	One of my favourite things about living in Doncaster, walking by St. George's Minster at night. http://t.co/pLt0UbECgI
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 00:41:20	@RobSummerfield1 I was once on a bus and 2 women behind me were comparing each of their son's probation officers. Classy.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-18 17:58:37	3 football matches &amp; 1 wrestling show on for the next week. Looking at the weather, I bet there's even a postponement due to a frozen ring.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 15:41:57	Ooh look, twitter is working again. Tadcaster 1 Brocton 1 at the moment, heading for half time. Not a bad game, Tad with the best of it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 00:53:59	The worst thing about getting home late is nothing to eat without cooking and I can't be arsed. If baby wakes up at 2 again, I'm eating him.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 00:55:01	@benbooth493 Good to meet you and Christine tonight. An absolute pleasure.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 00:57:43	Right. Sleep, breakfast, kiss Wife and kids, train to Leeds, meet @footballspoon , Tadcaster, football, home, kisses again, sleep. G'night.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 10:27:37	@BCAFCBH Frickley are on too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 10:48:35	Just about to head out and snow begins to fall. Going to be a fun day.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 12:36:07	Odd pricing on the bus from Leeds to Tadcaster. £5 one way but only £6 return. I'll have a return please.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 13:43:17	@Mister_Airsign AIR! Hope you're well.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 13:43:44	@peter27afcb Glad you liked it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 14:08:59	Went in the Angel &amp; White Horse pub on Tadcaster High St. £1.80 a pint, roaring coal fire and the smoking area has stables with Shire Horses
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 14:09:56	@mickcoleman427 Went in a Sams pub, really good place.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 14:27:09	@NickQuantrill No, in the ground now. They're singing already.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 19:25:07	@knockernorton1 @footballspoon @SeasidersReview I shall sort something out for you.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 19:34:02	Home and warm after a day of snow, rain and icy blue skies. Plus 5 goals, 2 red cards and an exciting game. http://t.co/w3fTDriXyZ
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 19:43:43	@BCAFCBH I kept an eye out but didn't see you, pretty busy though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 19:48:07	@BCAFCBH Spent most of the game stood near the atand behind the goal. Started down the side but got sick of kids bumping into me.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 14:28:54	In the ground. Clubhouse is heaving, they're singing outside already. Looking forward to this, half hour to kickoff for Tadcaster v Brocton
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 14:37:04	Ballboy pulled a hat from another one. The now hatless kid pounded the thief. Come to the football, get a MMA fight free.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 14:56:53	Teams head out amid flurries of snow. Game time.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 18:24:13	@footballspoon @knockernorton1 Good to hear you're a bit better. Missed a decent game, 5 goals 2 reds. Bloody cold though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-17 18:25:44	Train pulling out of Leeds, heading home. Bad phone reception at the game today. Tadcaster pulled out a 3-2 win. Good game.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 08:51:19	NFL investigating the Patriots for deflating balls in the AFC Championship last night. It's cheating, but not 45-7 worth of cheating.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 09:06:15	@WestStandBogs @BCDP2014 Wonderful, well done.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 13:46:28	Former Doncaster Mayor Martin Winter has a book out, making headlines in national newspapers. Biggest shock for me is that he can write.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 16:12:37	Asked Little 'Un if he had a good day at school. "Yes, Kieran pulled a talking tortoise out of the toilet".
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 16:14:25	@BCAFCBH It's an answer that provides so many more questions I daren't ask.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 16:23:07	@jtlovell1979 Didn't think you'd frequent that sort of 'cinema'.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 16:39:48	Watching the Ghana-Senegal AFCON game. The Senegal keeper could only be more entertaining if he juggled.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 21:03:19	On my 1st full day with the WWE network, I've watched Lucha Underground, NOAH and the 2nd half of TNA.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 21:04:36	@mrcraiglyons Thankfully it wasn't the film but a Japanese wrestling company.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 21:06:10	Speaking of TNA, Beat Down Clan? Couldn't think of anything closer to Bullet Club?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 21:07:28	@ned1984 I've started a bit of a watchlist. Go to the beginning and work my way through.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 21:13:21	@ned1984 That's why I thought I'd just start with the oldest stuff. Plenty to watch, but be nice to have some AWA or Mud South soon.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 21:16:22	@CatMorey Loving it. Found it annoying at first but it's grown on me. Lots of AAA wrestlers who seem to be doing a better job than in Mexico
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 21:17:22	@ned1984 That's the kicker for me. If the PPV streams don't work well I may not hang around for long.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 18:10:12	@DrMuttley Apparently it was a toy off the teacher's desk.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 18:14:26	@jonesthescribe It was some toy off the teacher's desk apparently. Just glad talking tortoise isn't a new drug all the 4 year olds are on.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 22:37:57	@BeerNBodyslams Surely you should follow the WWE example instead. If people like something, stop it and have Ziggler lose.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 22:43:11	Watching an old WWF card at MSG. No run ins, no heel authority figures, no ref bumps &amp; a crowd constantly bordering on a riot. Wrestling!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 18:55:38	Got in the bath and only realised as my foot hit the water that I'd left my socks on.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 19:01:43	@neillyfabi Threw them at the wall and they didn't stick, so at least a day or two left in them.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 19:02:36	@chaskynyrd They don't wear socks, can't find any to fit over 7 toes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 23:27:54	Much talk on here tonight about the #NHSDebate . Selling it off on the quiet to yourself &amp; your friends isn't privatisation, it's robbery.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 23:30:01	NHS will go the way of the Royal Mail, sold off on the cheap to the govt.'s mates. They're not politicians, they're gangsters.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 23:33:48	@neillyfabi Maybe, but probably used as a loss leader. Get people in the door, see which ones come with pound signs.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 23:36:12	@neillyfabi You're more trusting than I am.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 23:39:10	@neillyfabi Which leaves people back to the dark ages of paying a Dr to come see them at home. No money = hard luck.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-18 23:43:07	NFC game was fun, not so sure about the Pats - Colts game. Never like New England as a Dolphins fan &amp; the Colts are painfully dull.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-18 23:46:37	@switzr1 I've seen 3 or 4 of their games this year, fell asleep every time and not due to the time difference.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-18 23:47:46	Just signed up to the WWE Network. If anyone is available to babysit for the next 6 months, let me know.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 00:03:46	@MrMickEgo Email I got said I pay in 2 weeks and can cancel any time.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 00:07:18	@MrMickEgo It looks good. Works fine on my tablet too plus enough old content that I'll never watch RAW again!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-19 00:13:36	@MrMickEgo Maybe. It was a bit fiddly signing up so worth checking if all the boxes are filled in.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 18:21:01	At the Keepmoat for #DRFC v Notts County. Ticket on row U, which carries the hazard of being hit by a shot from Kyle Bennett.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 18:29:41	Lad on the Belle Vue bar being taught how to pull a pint. Did a good job until he couldn't be persuaded it's free for blokes with beards.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 18:31:28	Next task is to ask a programme seller "Is that the fanzine mate?" #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 18:35:49	@NickQuantrill I've a mate recently opened a vinyl shop. Doing decent trade apparently.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 12:56:59	Season tickets available at @donnybelles for £25, that's £1 more than 1 seat at #DRFC v Notts County tonight.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 18:48:37	Ad's for #DRFC hospitality packages from £90. That gets you a seat, food &amp; beer. Top rate is £500 &amp; gets a lapdance from Willie McKay.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 19:15:25	@AliceRadley Best wishes for your surgery Alice.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 19:16:55	@donnydeb At the Keepmoat.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 19:35:10	@donnydeb It's a great deal if you fancy watching them.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 19:37:08	Couple of icy patches by the South Stand and someone forgot to paint over the rugby markings. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 19:43:36	@donnydeb Always friendly at Belles, very different to men's football.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 19:44:10	Teams on their way out, all set for #DRFC v Notts County.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 20:04:30	County hit the bar with a screamer. Rovers otherwise with the best of it so far #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 20:06:41	Coppinger heads just wide. Should have at least hit the target #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 20:36:56	HT #DRFC 0 Notts County 0. Lots of possession and attacking intent without really worrying the keeper. County a well organised tough team.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 20:37:39	Trying to snow.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 21:07:51	30 to play, still 0-0, #DRFC still creating a ton but can't shoot. All playing well but McCullogh with a few sloppy mistakes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 21:08:35	#DRFC old boy Mustapha Dumbuya on for County.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 21:28:36	All Rovers. Main should have buried 2 and had a claim for a penalty turned down. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 21:34:36	County down to 10, player being subbed got a 2nd yellow for time wasting on his way off. Odd one. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 22:23:10	Sat on the train home still wondering how that ended 0-0. On another night #DRFC would have had 6.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 22:24:30	Rumours that Paul Dickov is arranging a team trip to a brothel in the hope one of them will score.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 22:27:34	Highly entertaining for a 0-0 tonight, swinging from absolute despair to uncontrollable laughter at the #DRFC finishing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-21 11:16:00	#DRFC opening a new branch of Nandos today. As the scissors approaches the ribbon, Roy Carroll leaps across &amp; tips them over the top.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-21 12:27:00	Worksop Town v Glossop North End in the FA Vase tonight has been postponed, now playing on Saturday. That means I get to stay warm tonight.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-21 13:44:22	Paul Dickov- "After opening Nandos, the whole #DRFC squad will miss training with the runs. We're looking to bring some bog roll in on loan"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-21 13:47:04	PD -" Harry Forrester will be out for a while, he thought a bottle of Nandos Peri Peri sauce was fake tan &amp; he's blistered his nose" #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-21 13:49:34	PD -" Luke McCullogh is now barred from Nandos. I asked him to pass the salt but he shanked it and smashed a window" #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-21 15:58:33	@MarkMark1952 He doesn't have much love in his life bless him.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-21 16:59:26	Lazio dismiss accusations of their fans having fascist leanings by wearing the 1939 Germany away kit next season.  http://t.co/47FhoX8j3y
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-21 17:06:48	@rainedonparade Have you ever seen a smiling Nazi?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-21 19:09:02	@vivarovers I'm disappointed the updates aren't in Welsh with English subtitles.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-21 20:02:26	Good 1-0 halftime lead for #DRFC Youth at Swansea in the cup. Fingers crossed for the 2nd half.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-21 20:24:31	Dylan Thomas scored for Swansea v #DRFC Youth. Who's on the bench, James Joyce and Oscar Wilde?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-22 13:28:38	Thinking of following the lead of #DRFC and holding a vote on which shirt I should wear at the next home game.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-22 13:30:44	Maybe I should also follow the lead of #DRFC and change my underwear every season instead of the current 2.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-22 13:52:53	@vivarovers Also the last shirt I bought.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-21 21:46:04	Disappointing that #DRFC went down 2-1 to Swansea in the FA Youth Cup tonight. No disgrace in that result though &amp; a good run this year.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-20 15:30:48	Only worry about watching #DRFC tonight in these temperatures is not the cold but the current fashion for huge bobble hats.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-22 20:30:50	Enjoying the WWE Network so far. Working through the old World Class shows, very good if slightly corny by modern tastes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-22 20:32:41	One story has Ric Flair taking out a hit on Kerry Von Erich. I saw them against each other 10 years later at Sheffield Arena.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-22 20:36:39	@DaveAvison Amazing how many wrestlers die young, combination of drugs, drink and taking bumps every night I suppose.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-22 20:40:56	@DaveAvison Only in his 20's I think. That was drugs on top of a heart condition he didn't know he had.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-22 20:47:51	@AliceRadley The hospital did my hair for me last year too. Unfortunately it was via chemotherapy! Good to see they're taking care of you.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-22 15:25:32	Leon Brittan dies before facing the sexual abuse enquiry. Has anyone checked on Prince Andrew?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-22 20:58:25	The Freebirds have just arrived on these WCCW shows &amp; King Kong Bundy is on strike. Lots of fun.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-22 20:59:56	A few mysterious gaps in the available shows, especially as they're easily found with a quick youtube search.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-22 21:10:34	@jmsutton That's just a regular shirt with pineapple on it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-22 22:30:00	Tom Brady must be the first man to have his balls interfered with and not notice.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 16:57:06	@markusparkus75 @jonesthescribe I'm at a wrestling show in Mexborough tonight.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 16:59:03	@jonesthescribe @markusparkus75 Sweaty men in trunks pretending to beat each other up is very similar to a night in the Plough.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 17:05:43	Off to the Wrestling shortly. The real name of 1 wrestler appearing tonight is Paul McCartney. Do I sing the Frog Song or Mull Of Kintyre?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 18:04:37	Rush hour train from Doncaster to Sheffield, 1 carriage. Royal Rumble starts early courtesy of Northern Rail.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 18:27:39	@northernrailorg Thanks, my size 11s avoided everyone's toes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 18:28:02	Aww, bless 'em. "@northernrailorg: @TonyCSGreenall Sorry for any discomfort caused Tony"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 18:30:41	In the Old Market Hall pub at Mexborough. Bit posh for this area. There are people without house arrest tags and everything.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 18:32:17	@Gazz_Long I'm sat near the door just in case.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 18:34:23	1st of 2 Wrestling shows for me this weekend. Tonight is Megaslam Wrestling, a more traditional family style show. Usually good fun.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 18:35:37	@NickQuantrill It was the long time home of poet Ted Hughes, which is ironic considering literacy levels round here.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 18:37:43	Wrestling in Sheffield on Sunday too, features @Ligero1 , Stixx, Bubblegum, Chris Masters &amp; a few from EBW.  http://t.co/2RgSPMuoNm
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 18:43:44	Megaslam have their 6th anniversary show at Doncaster Dome on Feb 6. El Ligero, Frankie Sloan, Saraya Knight &amp; more. Plus a cage match!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 18:51:16	The Old Market Hall pub at Mexborough, trying its best to make it seem nice round here. http://t.co/NFQVTwJgQm
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 19:11:57	In the venue, very busy. Always a good thing to see at a little indy show is the promoter hurtling around with extra chairs.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 19:17:04	Must pay a visit to the gimmick table, Little 'Un will never forgive me if I don't buy him a lucha mask.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 19:28:30	A kid just told his Dad tonight will have the greatest Wrestling match ever. I'm now looking forward to Randy Savage v Ricky Steamboat
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 19:31:59	Haha! The ref comes out to Let's Get Ready To Rumble by PJ &amp; Duncan
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 19:34:21	Curtain jerker is the title match, Bully Boy Carter v Josh Anderson. WWE booking right there.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 19:36:07	Wrestling! http://t.co/VvEhbOivJf
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 19:49:19	Bully Boy Carter retains the title by submission. Never really got going but a couple of good bits  from Anderson who I've never seen.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 19:50:20	Next up Emotastic Owen Cross v Terry Isit. Always fun to watch Isit.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 20:02:51	Terry Isit pins Owen Cross. Not bad despite the most unconvincing punches &amp; kicks I've ever seen.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 20:03:50	Good one up next the excellent Paul Malen v Doncaster's Jack Dynamo.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 20:17:56	Dynamo just did the old nut job on the ring post to Malen but let a kid from the crowd pull one leg. Brilliant.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 20:33:15	Jack Dynamo gets the pin over Paul Malen. Great stuff. Malen pulled every heel trick in the book, brilliant.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 20:35:42	Malen used a mysterious foreign substance, strangled Dynamo with turnbuckle rope and even took a crutch from a Woman in the crowd.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 09:10:42	The horde crossing the road outside school makes me worry that all these people have children.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 09:19:59	@markusparkus75 Considering Doncaster racecourse runs around a golf course, that's a bold statement.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 09:23:21	Off to the Wrestling tonight. It's in Mexborough, the kind of place where they wrestle in a steel cage to keep the audience out.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 09:33:33	On the card tonight is Terry Isit. 1st time I saw him he had a cold &amp; blew his nose in his opponent's face. Greatest thing I've ever seen.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 09:37:16	@prodnose As a 7 year old, Billy Bremner gave my Dad &amp; I a lift from Leeds city centre to Elland Road for Eddie Gray's testimonial.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 10:25:57	What's the acceptable number of cups of coffee I can make before I stop putting off getting some work done?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 11:02:47	@chuckie_css Not far off!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 11:35:19	The answer is 3 "@drfc_official: VOTE  The 2015/16 away kit will be chosen by YOU http://t.co/Dp9uCfnoYP #DRFC #IRWT http://t.co/6itijssut2"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 11:39:05	Voting on the last RT tells me "The developers of this app have not set up facebook login properly". Like our defence at corners #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 11:54:22	@darrenlindley7 @drfc_official Away kit should always be green, just as the home kit should always be hooped. As nature intended.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 11:55:51	@TheLJMonk @drfc_official Probably not, as so few do.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 12:00:49	@TheLJMonk @drfc_official New York Cosmos wore green, but they ended up as a restaurant in Frenchgate.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 12:03:54	@TheLJMonk Bentley Colliery wear green...oh, I see your point.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 12:05:31	Ran down the street naked and cheering. A policeman stopped me. "Adrian Chiles?" he said and gave me a high five.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 20:36:22	@Donnymustangs Anyone without deflated balls.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 20:47:05	Is the ref having a cig outside in the interval breaking Kayfabe?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 20:50:38	Hillbilly Butch Brown v Super Porky up next. Hillbilly needs my beard
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 20:51:33	Super Porky jumps on Hillbilly's back and rides him round the ring. Worth the entrance money right there.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 20:59:56	Super Porky wins. Despite being hit with a horseshoe.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 21:01:08	Main event time, it's a rumble. Highly appropriate this weekend.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 21:02:56	Rumble begins with Jack Dynamo and Jack Slaughter.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 21:03:53	Next in Paul Malen
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 21:06:51	Joah Anderson in, Caleb Cool in. Jack Slaughter out. Probably for the best, he was knocking on a bit.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 21:12:04	Super Porky enters and thrown straight over the top rope. "He wasn't ready" shout the crowd.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 21:13:02	Terry Isit wins. Probably because I bought his dvd. Which means I won really doesn't it?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 21:21:23	@switzr1 Fantastic to see. Wider than he is tall.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 21:23:17	Fun show, Malen v Dynamo match of the night. Jack Dynamo looks the business, a bit of Will Ospreay about him. From Doncaster too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 21:25:33	Finished early enough that I may get to see my mate's band in the Woolpack. They're called GBone, get along if Pearl Jam-ish is your thing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 21:32:10	@switzr1 Just black tights this time. I think I've seen the Elvis outfit online before.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 21:37:39	Followed during the Wrestling by  @WeShootProperty . Hope  they sell houses with tales of road trips with Terry Funk &amp; Jim Cornette.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 22:18:40	In the Woolpack, where one of the bar staff is a Dwarf. I have a lucha mask in my pocket. If I was a bad person...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 22:21:33	@Gazz_Long He climbs on a stool. He's a good lad, used to work in the Corner Pin.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 22:36:12	First support band were called Digits, from Newcastle. Very good. Bought 2 cd's. One for @PayasoDeMierda to go see.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 22:51:26	@PayasoDeMierda Definite punk elements added to a bit of modern shouty rock. Foo Fighters ish.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 22:53:02	2nd act are awful, but they're called The Midnight Dogs so I should have seen that coming. Escaped to the Mason's for 1.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 22:53:45	@TadcasterAlbion @jaytaylormedia1 @glasshoughtonfc Could go skiing at Glasshoughton though :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 23:17:02	@PayasoDeMierda @ThePopGroup @TeenageFanclub And so you should.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 23:18:26	Back to the Woolpack after tales of apparent #DRFC legend Uros Predic with @jonesthescribe &amp; @markusparkus75 .
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 23:19:32	Turns out Predic went on to play for Serbian White Eagles and Kaiser Clowns. What a career.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 22:22:13	Matthews still in his coat. Eventually he's going to slit Taz open and climb inside to keep warm. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 22:54:07	Are they really ending the show with a rerun of last week? #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 22:55:23	@RealDrBumble Last viewer standing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 23:00:01	@AliceRadley That's how I watch in recent months, like a 50s sci-fi B movie. So bad you just have to giggle and enjoy it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-23 23:57:09	Always slightly uncomfortable when your mates'  band turn out to be average pub rock...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-24 00:17:17	@Delaware_Dolfan Someone bought me a beer so I had to stick it out.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 23:49:45	Night continues with more WCCW. Kevin Von Erich just told Terry Gordy "I'm going to kick your fanny". Good thing the kids are in bed.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-24 00:26:51	Hope a policeman stops me on my walk home so I can pull the lucha mask out of my pocket and tell him my name is El Doncastico.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-24 01:16:53	Home, no Policemen stopped me with the Lucha mask. A good thing really as I'd be shit at a Hurricanrana off the North Bridge.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-24 14:05:16	No football for me today, Wife has been sick as a dog all morning. Still, it will make a nice change being home on Saturday.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-24 14:10:09	@PayasoDeMierda @NcleBenfield Enjoy it, I was originally going to be at Ossett Albion v Darlington. Haven't seen Darlo since they reformed.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 16:42:46	Whatever made my Wife ill yesterday has given me a kicking today. Giving the Wrestling in Sheffield a miss.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 16:43:58	Bug has probably come from snot ridden kid at school. I suggest disinfecting the little swines.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 16:46:15	Royal Rumble tonight &amp; as it's in Philadelphia the surprise entrants will probably be ECW related. Dudleys, Meanie, RVD for me.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-24 01:34:32	@bamberhil I have #4 sat waiting to be read, but my favourite Superior Iron Man thing is my Wife reading #1 1st and saying "He's a dick"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-24 01:46:23	Good to see pics from @PCW_UK tonight &amp; the support for @RealKrisTravis . As someone who has been hit with cancer, it brings a tear or two.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-24 01:49:14	If you're a wrestling fan and want to support Kris Travis go to @PCW_UK 's page or follow @WPCancerCharity and be generous.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-24 01:51:29	Cancer obviously isn't much fun. Several months on I still have pain plus chemo side effects. And I piss myself occasionally which is great.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-24 01:53:26	It's a different experience for everyone, but mine has generally been positive. Go do something fun afterwards if you can. Fuck it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-24 01:59:03	@RudyardKipling7 I'm hoping the library is open tomorrow, I'm short on paste.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-24 02:02:23	@RudyardKipling7 It usually does :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-24 02:05:44	Reyt, off to bed. It's Saturday, there's Football to be had.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 19:50:27	Daniel Bryan will be screwed out of a #RoyalRumble win tonight due to HHH's deflated balls.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 19:53:14	@ata_dizdar They seem determined to make Reigns though, plus they may want a repeat of last year's build &amp; wind the fans up.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 20:00:10	@ata_dizdar Reigns is dull to watch and can't talk to save his life. But if Vince has him as his favourite then Philly can boo all night.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 20:02:44	@chaskynyrd @ata_dizdar Not since he faced off with Obi Wan Kenobi.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 20:04:17	@chaskynyrd @ata_dizdar He runs some sort of spiritual retreat these days.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 21:01:52	Feast or fired on #impactuk .One of last year's stupider gimmicks makes a return.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 21:05:34	Feast or fired would be better if one of the briefcases had @JimmyHavoc inside it. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 21:19:51	Bram with the Friday night kebab shop greeting to Magnus there, "Come on then, I'm gonna smash your 'ead in!" #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 21:26:12	Lashley is bigger than the cupboard Matthews and Taz commentate from #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 21:34:44	Pack of salad from the shop over the road says "Suitable for Vegetarians" on it. Imagine the scandal when it actually turns out to be horse.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 21:54:11	Can't be any heating in the commentary cupboard, Matthews always has his coat on #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 21:58:17	Low Ki appears to be the first banana to win the X Division title #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 22:00:24	@DefinitelyCausy I try to blank him from my mind.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 22:02:53	@magillaposition No lights, no sound, it's the first Braille Wrestling Federation.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 22:04:18	@ChillMascaras He's dressed in a yellow lycra all in one.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 22:07:35	@magillaposition I reckon Nacho Lacho's agent is in charge of the production budget.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 22:10:03	Considering the production values on #impactuk , I reckon Borash's head shave is a budget cut rather than a storyline.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 00:32:34	Mid match ad's for the show you're already watching. Only £9.99 on the WWE Network. #RoyalRumble
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 00:38:43	Crowd is loud and very pro Cesaro/Kidd. Every half arsed face is getting the crap booed out of them tonight. #RoyalRumble
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 00:41:16	@MidnightGuthrie The shirts said Brass Ring Club.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 01:06:21	Network stream just skipped to shout "You didn't know?" twice, like I didn't know the first time. #RoyalRumble
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 01:15:46	The Ascension are the new divas match. #RoyalRumble
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 01:22:16	Is this the night Sandow gives Miz a good kicking? #RoyalRumble
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 01:24:31	@DefinitelyCausy That would be fun.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 01:38:04	Little 'Un shout from upstairs, "Daddy, I need a drink". He could at least have waited for the divas match when we all need a drink.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 01:49:38	Looking forward to Paige's Mum, Saraya, wrestling at Doncaster Dome for @MegaslamUK in a couple of weeks. Even if she does scare me a bit.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 02:03:38	From the sound of the crowd, if Cena wins this, the Rumble match will have to wait until after the riot. #RoyalRumble
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 02:07:47	As big as he is, Lesnar has little old man legs. #RoyalRumble
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 02:20:22	Even Mick Foley cringed at that flying elbow from Rollins #RoyalRumble
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 02:26:48	Lesnar is going to win by hitting Cena and Rollins with a paramedic. #RoyalRumble
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 02:30:08	Very good. Enjoyed that. Now for Sting to win the #RoyalRumble
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 02:50:12	Hopefully that wasn't a one off from Bubba Dudley #RoyalRumble
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 03:04:17	He's going to grab a mic and bang on about yoga isn't he? #RoyalRumble
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 03:15:27	Ton of boos for Reigns. Only way they'll cheer is if someone hits him with that giant Colt Cabana head #RoyalRumble
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-24 18:13:00	Some good results for Doncaster teams today, Armthorpe won 5-1, Bentley 4-0 &amp; Harworth 5-0 to go top of the CMFL.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-24 21:54:50	@MegaslamUK Enjoyed it thanks, the Malen v Dynamo match made the night. Look forward to seeing the Dome show.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-25 22:20:01	Good to see they got Andrews on tv quickly #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 03:43:35	So, Reigns is a popular winner then? #RoyalRumble
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 03:47:25	Title match was excellent but the Rumble match was pretty dull really.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 03:48:58	Reigns so popular, there was even a kid in a Cena shirt giving him the thumbs down. #RoyalRumble
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 03:50:54	@retlivdead It was really dull, no fun spots to remember.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 03:55:03	One good thing is the network worked OK. Skipped back a second or 2 several times but perfectly watchable.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 04:02:03	Off to bed before the inevitable Rollins style flying elbow off Little 'Un in a couple of hours.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 10:38:55	Watched last night's WWE Raw already, half hour of Heyman talking and some pictures of snow. Should do that every week.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 11:25:57	@Halopauly Well, that stinks.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 15:57:33	Football tonight, 745pm, @RossingtonMain v Nostell MW in the Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire Senior Cup QF. All the cool kids will be there. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 18:00:55	Bloke in the pub loudly praising the Daily Mail for attacking Milliband &amp; "bloody socialists". Round here, he'll be found in a skip later.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 18:04:26	The big mouthed Mail reader is wearing a red &amp; green checked jumper. He's the perfect reason to ban Golf.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 18:14:00	This pub has a quiz night on Thursday and Sunday. Loudmouth Mail reader should enter, he appears to know everything.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 19:17:17	At Rosso for their county cup game v Nostell. Should be goals tonight, Nostell have struggled this year &amp; are there for the taking.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 19:46:56	Teams out, set for kickoff, Rossington Main v Nostell MW.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 19:51:45	"Look at your linesman you pudding", shouts 1 of the crowd. Funnily enough, the ref is actually shaped like a disappointingly small muffin.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 19:57:26	Scramble in the box &amp; Rosso clip one over the bar.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 20:23:15	Rossington go close twice in quick succession, stepping up the pressure a bit. Scrappy 0-0 up to now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 20:28:33	Another save from Saynor in the Nostell net. Goals beginning to look likely.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 20:38:30	HT Rossington Main 0 Nostell MW 0. Rosso getting on top as the half went on but need a goal.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 20:39:48	@plymkrprss It is, yes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 20:49:44	2nd half underway
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 20:51:20	@plymkrprss Made a few good saves so far.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 20:57:28	Great shot from the Nostell #11 from the edge of the box, top corner all the way but a wonderful save by Wildey tips away for a corner.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 21:13:33	Much brighter from Nostell 2nd half, header hit the bar.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 21:14:26	Referee tonight is proof that being steaming drunk is no barrier to running around a field for 90 minutes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 21:40:16	90 mins up, Rossington Main 0 Nostell 0. Extra time, though I doubt my phone battery will make it. Keep the millions following in suspense
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 13:03:16	The much delayed FA Vase game between Shaw Lane Aquaforce &amp; Walsall Wood is now being played tomorrow at Sandy Lane, Worksop.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 13:05:18	Tomorrow #DRFC fans, head to Oxford Street for @RossingtonMain v Nostell MW in the Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire Senior Cup QF, 745pm kickoff.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 22:39:08	Home. Extra time went exceedingly well for a minute...then the floodlights went. A replay to come I should think.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 22:40:38	@JCWatkin I'm just glad I got a lift home, would have been stood for an hour waiting for a bus.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 22:49:07	@JCWatkin My raffle tickets are in my back pocket, best keep them for priority sales of replay tickets.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 22:52:18	@JCWatkin You won't need many.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 14:55:26	@HaveTilFive Very loud from the start, though they clearly turned down the volume at the end &amp; turned up the music.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 15:46:19	Has the Governor of Connecticut called a state of emergency because of the weather or because he saw the Rumble last night? #WWE
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 22:54:26	Good thing I didn't win the half time raffle, I would have had to hand it back in an abandoned game.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 22:55:21	@JCWatkin Only Lidl and Aldi for NCEL teams.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 22:59:40	@JordWildey Odd rule. Reckon you should still win though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 23:01:37	Well done @SLAquaFC winning 4-1 over Walsall Wood in the FA Vase tonight. Flackwell Heath at home in the last 16.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 23:04:07	@JordWildey Probably the best they've played for a while considering their results. Can't see them doing it twice.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 23:05:00	@MattydonnyRover Good to meet you tonight. Enjoy Chesterfield.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 23:05:39	@JordWildey Just hope you get a different ref, he was awful.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 23:10:11	@JordWildey Couldn't understand half of what he did. Free kicks when nothing happened or given the wrong way when there was a foul. Odd.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 23:14:43	@JordWildey I remember one linesman, he reffed a Bawtry game at the Keepmoat and wasn't great.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 23:40:51	Wrestling on. All the pyro used by WWE these days, Ric Flair's entrance v Harley Race at Starrcade 83 involves a spotlight &amp; a disco ball.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 23:43:48	The NWA logo on the canvas is clearly made from yellow tape &amp; no effort has been made to mop up the blood from previous matches. Perfect.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 16:00:14	@Mister_Airsign Title match was excellent but the Rumble match was extremely dull. Rest of the matches were average.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 16:06:47	Mothers on the school run complaining about the cold. I'm surprised as I feel fine &amp; most of them are fatter and hairier than me.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 16:11:44	@Mister_Airsign Yes, saw lots of those. Bit stupid really, just because Reigns won. They'll be back when the story changes like last year
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 16:28:05	@vivarovers Won't be the first time he's spent 10 minutes on TV talking balls.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 23:44:51	@JCWatkin They've only just got colour tv on this one.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 23:45:58	@JCWatkin Goodnight.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 23:58:18	I spend half of these classic matches on the WWE Network watching for @HeymanHustle taking pictures at ringside.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-28 00:03:08	@HaveTilFive Seen Heyman? Not sure, I keep seeing Bill Apter and lots of cameramen wearing flares.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-28 08:58:22	@GazMan16 Good news, hope she's well.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-28 14:06:57	Never mind your internationals, #DRFC have signed a player with a blue tick.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-26 16:33:49	@TheLJMonk @vivarovers Ha! That's good that
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-29 13:18:46	@JoeTeulon I'm the same, just sick of reboots/remakes &amp; Hollywood's inability to create new stories. Couldn't care less about the actors sex
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 11:24:05	Uche Ikpeazu heading to #DRFC on loan from Watford?  http://t.co/YdQNC6TbFO
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-28 16:16:43	In the last 10 minutes we've had sunshine, rain, snow and hail. Only weather missing are actual cats &amp; dogs.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 18:16:52	Ha! They're drowning out bigmouth with the jukebox. His right wing rant has become Rock Lobster by The B52's.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 18:30:49	Glorious by @drfc_official . Website problems, so follow on twitter, unless you don't have twitter, in which case go to the website.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-27 18:32:27	"If you don't have twitter" posted on twitter is like leaving a post it note for a blind man #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-29 19:17:15	Brian Cage ripped the title belt in half on Lucha Underground. They'll have to make a new one out of old phone books.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-29 22:09:37	@Wanda102 Just downloaded the new podcast, looking forward to listening.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 09:49:01	30 cars stranded on the Woodhead Pass. Anyone who set off over there in the snow should be left. More oxygen for the rest of us.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 09:50:28	Newspaper editors who think Andy Murray's girlfriend being a bit sweary is news can bollocks too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 10:05:04	@fenlandgent There's a horrific irony too it that's for sure.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 10:33:55	Watching last night's WWE Smackdown. Reigns not helping his cause with a painfully bad match.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 10:48:40	@UncladScamMail Entrance is like a shitty dance remix of a NZ rugby haka.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 10:50:18	@UncladScamMail You can't say that. These days it's Commentator of Colour.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 13:14:49	@footballspoon Left one.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 13:31:36	Must be a lookalike convention in town. So far I've seen Steven Gerrard, an Angry Biker and a black Mel Brooks.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 14:25:56	Ridiculous wind at the Keepmoat. Should make the game interesting. A few minutes to kickoff, Bawtry Town v Worsbrough Bridge.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 14:36:15	1' Bawtry Town 0 Worsbrough 1. After watching two 0-0 games in a row, I have to wait all of 30 seconds for a goal today
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 15:02:48	27' Bawtry 1 Worsbrough 1. Equaliser for the home side, miles offside but allowed to stand.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 15:23:15	HT Bawtry Town 1 Worsbrough Bridge 1. Bit scrappy but not bad considering the wind.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 15:46:57	57' Bawtry 1 Worsbrough 2, cracking volley from 20 yards, keeper had no chance.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 04:37:02	Laid awake in bed for 2 hours, finally gave in and got up. Today will involve lots of coffee and being grumpy.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 09:26:07	@bellesnoisyfans @GirlsontheBall @donnybelles @LondonBees Weather is lovely today, I'm going in my bikini.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 09:31:34	@JulianBarker111 @bellesnoisyfans @GirlsontheBall @donnybelles @LondonBees I'll get one of those viking hats as a disguise.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 09:36:50	Local games rapidly falling to the weather. I was looking forward to a double header with the Belles game.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 09:44:05	@DanumEagles Already lined up as an option.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 10:27:47	2 games on in Doncaster this afternoon, both at Keepmoat 2, @bawtry_fc u21s v Millmoor at noon &amp; 1st team v Worsbrough Bridge at 230. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 10:29:30	Then of course tonight at 630 at Keepmoat, Women's FA Cup 3rd round, @donnybelles v @LondonBees #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 10:41:41	Walking Football for over 50s is a great idea, though if one turns up in a St Pauli shirt, are they a Broken Hipster?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 10:43:45	Haven't heard if @BCollieryfc v Kinsley Boys is on. Always a chance down The Avenue that some bugger has nicked the snow off the pitch.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-29 01:17:28	Watching #WWENXT before bed. As good as the show consistently is, the ring announcer's voice makes me question my will to live.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 17:40:12	I see the Doncaster horse botherer has been jailed for 4 years. With good behaviour he'll be out in time for the 2.30 at Newmarket.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 17:41:34	Prison shouldn't be too bad for him, all the carrots and sugar lumps he can eat plus I'm sure he'll be ridden out twice a day.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 12:21:53	@footballspoon After two 0-0s in a row, I'll be happy with any goal at all today.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 12:26:17	@footballspoon @georgercheetham Ouch! 2 games today so I may have a crack at that.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 12:31:05	@footballspoon @georgercheetham Well the Belles game this evening should have a few, Donny won 7-0 the last time they played London.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 12:44:01	You know you have small children when you go to put your shoes on and find half a banana in one.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 18:25:47	Put Football Heaven on for the County Cup draw and Steve Evans is talking. The milk suddenly curdled in the fridge &amp; the clock ran backwards
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 18:51:02	Sheffield and Hallamshire Senior Cup SF draw sees @RossingtonMain away at Maltby Main, Athersley Rec or Penistone Church.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 19:09:32	Looking forward to tomorrow night, opening game of the year for @donnybelles v London Bees in the FA Cup. 630 at the Keepmoat, £5/£1 #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 16:01:51	One off the bar for Bawtry. Still 2-1 down with under 20 to play but far from out of it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 16:11:33	Bawtry have created 3 or 4 great chances in the last few minutes but it just won't go in. Time running out
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 16:23:45	FT Bawtry Town 1 Worsbrough Bridge 2
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 19:12:04	Many of last year's team have stayed on with a few good signings &amp; a new manager. Get down &amp; watch an exciting season at @donnybelles #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 19:13:40	@donnybelles I certainly will be. Season ticket bought, bells polished!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 19:21:31	@donnybelles I did thank you. Put the receipt on my phone do I don't forget it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 19:23:05	@rainedonparade @donnybelles Yes,they're available to buy at the office now I believe
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 16:54:32	Gone for a between match warm in the pub round the corner. The Worsbrough Bridge team have just walked in too. Beer in short supply soon.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 17:08:17	Good result for #DRFC today. Disappointing to let a 2 goal lead slip but hard to complain at a point away at Chesterfield.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 17:10:58	It seems a veggie burger in this pub is £9.99. Must check to see if that's in lira not pounds.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 17:23:51	@Driftpeasant I would hope so.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 17:32:26	Hour to kickoff at the Keepmoat for @donnybelles season opener v @LondonBees . Plenty of time to get yourself there, just a fiver in. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 17:39:21	@WWFShow Cold? What's wrong with you, it's tropical...in the pub round the corner.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 18:15:49	In a brighter, warmer Keepmoat for @donnybelles v @LondonBees with a visit to the merch stand. @suesmith8 football cards! Result!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-29 10:22:08	Spending the next two days wandering by football grounds with a hair dryer in the hope of a game on Saturday.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 21:12:01	Great old stuff on WWE Network, just saw Muhammad Ali interrupt a Gorilla Monsoon match. Monsoon put him in an airplane spin. Ali legged it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-29 13:22:20	Sheffield Wednesday look set to be taken over by a Thai group. Look forward to discovering red &amp; white stripes are lucky in Thailand.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 18:31:56	Teams heading out, kickoff shortly.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 18:39:31	Bees manager Julian Broomes is quite animated. Appears to be leading a zumba class on the sideline.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 18:50:31	1st clear chance for Belles as Sweetman-Kirk heads just over.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-30 22:16:22	It's obvious that @realmickfoley hid those wings because they didn't have @JRsBBQ sauce on them  http://t.co/WBrJMoaZyO
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 19:05:57	Half hour gone, still 0-0. Belles on top and created several good chances but making hard work of it around the goal. 1st game rust.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 19:22:30	HT Doncaster Belles 0 London Bees 0, full of passing and movement, just can't score.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 19:31:29	@footballspoon Made a nice change. Doncaster have had 10-15 shots tonight, just won't go in.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 19:33:25	There's the threat of extra time and penalties. It's too cold for that. We'll have a winner from Belles 2nd half by hook or by crook.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 19:48:25	53' Doncaster Belles 1 London Bees 0. At last! Beth England strikes to grab the lead.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 19:57:21	62' Doncaster 2 London 0, lovely bit of play ending with a goal for Sweetman - Kirk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 20:14:02	78' Doncaster 3 London 0, Smith with a curling free kick which slips through the keeper's hands. Oops!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 20:29:56	FT Doncaster Rovers Belles 3 London Bees 0
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 21:30:55	@DaveMadill1 @donnybelles @LondonBees 3-0 to Belles.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 21:31:45	@tellitots Lovely this playing Women's Football in the summer isn't it?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-01-31 21:46:20	Couple of good games today, well worth the loss of a testicle to frostbite.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 19:39:59	Hectic day, knackered. One kid in bed, another not far off. Then it's just me, #impactuk and the Superbowl.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 19:51:22	#WWE fans are going to be pissed off when they discover Daniel Bryan isn't in the #SuperBowl
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 23:35:25	@RTIDbelly Having played both, American Football hurts more.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 23:42:12	@RTIDbelly Always makes me laugh when people think Union is tougher than League. Not even close when you see top teams like Rhinos.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 23:46:43	@RTIDbelly A bit like that Rugby Football League game you were at today :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 23:48:13	HHH is at the Superbowl. Only a matter of time before he walks out and makes it a three way match.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 23:48:50	@RTIDbelly And laid there doing nothing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 23:50:21	@UncladScamMail Haha! I was just thinking that!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 00:03:20	@DennisCricket_  Superbowl will be the name of the new IPL innovation, a seven ball over.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 00:27:45	@AWBAblog Often the same with cup finals and championship games. Been a few good Superbowls in recent years though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 21:07:07	Wonder how cold Josh Matthews is in the Commentary Cupboard this week? Has Taz nicked the duvet? #impactuk

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 01:17:33	If the Superbowl was in England, right now there'd be a fat bloke trying to hit the crossbar from halfway for a £10 club shop voucher.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 02:12:12	This is set perfectly for a late Brady comeback. I feel sick.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 21:52:12	What kind of bar is that supposed to be? Looks like a sauna. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 22:00:37	Barely any sound in the commentary cupboard &amp; music over the top. Production budget appears to be $1.39 #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 22:11:17	4 way, 3 way, gimmick match. Anyone remember Wrestling? #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 22:19:39	Tyrus stands like he's had an accident and daren't tell his Mum #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 22:23:36	Andrews getting a win on #impactuk .Only a few weeks since I saw him lose in a pokey nightclub. Good on him.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 22:34:15	A skinny bearded villain with a title shot in a briefcase, a MMA fighter champion. Where do they think of these ideas? #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 22:38:20	I see the annual UK tradition of I don't understand/don't like American Football tweets has begun.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 22:42:59	@harlequinskiss It seems to be the only thing people tweet this stuff for. Don't get them for other events.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 22:50:21	@harlequinskiss It's easy not to watch though, doesn't kickoff until 1130.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 22:56:06	@harlequinskiss Same with anything though. I can't stand F1 or Britain's Got Talent type stuff. I just ignore it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 23:00:42	@kevin809900 I was just about to tweet that!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 23:08:06	Katy Perry on at halftime of the #SuperBowl . I prefer the British football version of announcing who won a mixed grill on the raffle.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 23:09:16	@magillaposition Are you sure it's really him then?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 23:11:32	Ate a huge bag of Punjabi Mix. That's my #SuperBowl ring sorted.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 23:13:40	@magillaposition Fake Sting, fake Undertaker and now fake Russo. When will the madness end?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 23:19:08	All these anthems mangled by pop stars is what the mute button was invented for.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 23:22:54	Bill Bellichick going for the Roman Reigns heat during the anthems.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 23:27:04	Michelle Tafoya with the wardrobe malfunction, looks naked when she turns sideways. #SuperBowl
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-01 23:40:17	Ads in the US during the Superbowl cost millions. Over here you can probably get one for twenty quid.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 00:07:02	Still 0-0 at the Superbowl. Could be a replay at Villa Park a week on Tuesday.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 00:09:57	It's often said Americans don't like 'soccer' due to a lack of scoring.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 00:15:47	@mirkobolesan @GirlsontheBall Unfortunately she can't see a damn thing in that outfit and is led around while waving at the empty seats.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 00:17:50	@mirkobolesan @GirlsontheBall Not a role I'd fancy.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 00:23:50	Dull game so far. I bet all the celebrities in the crowd are glad they didn't have to pay for their tickets.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 00:26:07	@Halopauly A listers pay the teams to come to them
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 00:36:45	I hope Lane comes out for the second half, has to be an advantage for a receiver to have 2 elbows.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 00:48:51	@Halopauly Looks like a giant grain silo.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 00:49:56	Laziest TD I've seen in a while.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 00:58:54	Everyone saw the pass to Matthews there except the Patriots.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 01:05:04	@biggazlaw Even the tv highlighted him
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 01:20:37	I muted the Superbowl halftime show and I like it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 01:32:25	Getting a shit ton of retweets is surprisingly irritating. My phone sounded like it was singing along to Katy Perry.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 11:40:08	BBC have bloggers on FIFA &amp; Football Manager for transfer deadline day. Shark jumped.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 11:43:30	@AFHStewart Are you doing it?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 11:45:44	@AFHStewart Haha! Good work. I shall have a look, just noticed it was there and thought WTF? Glad it's for fun.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 11:48:30	@AFHStewart Probably someone at Sky lining up a serious version for any mid afternoon lull.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 02:48:17	Second Sunday in a row with an obvious and disappointing ending.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 02:57:30	What a bizarre and beautiful catch!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 03:00:07	Nooooooo! Bastards.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 11:58:37	Listening to @MEPodcast and discovered @Pipbubblegum played for Witton Albion. Learn something new every day.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 03:04:47	Just need a few Seahawks to give Brady a good shoeing for a great ending
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 03:10:04	Yes, the Seahawks would normally have given that ball to Lynch, but remember he was only here so he didn't get fined.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-02 13:48:32	A tweet I made during the Superbowl seems to have had almost 400 retweets, proving people are easily pleased at 2am.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-03 07:25:36	Snot, sore throat, achy bits. Marvellous.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-03 08:50:02	Paul Dickov says he looks after #DRFC's money like it's his own. Bet his kids had a great Christmas, got some Lego on loan until the summer.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-03 19:17:20	Shaved off my beard after a couple of months. Now Baby cries at me. I need some kind of beardwig.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 12:38:13	@vivarovers In honour of Coppinger, you'll be giving away a free haircut then?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 12:43:40	@biggazlaw @vivarovers With a bit of luck, though the looking for a second opinion makes me think there's an injury.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 10:43:09	Match report from Saturdays @donnybelles v @LondonBees game on the @bellesnoisyfans site.  https://t.co/XnEauDOt1T
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 16:10:55	Excellent. @PayasoDeMierda contrasts rising fan culture at Clapton &amp; Dulwich with their Northern League counterparts. http://t.co/cOol26PkTm
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 11:11:00	@UncladScamMail Leafs just need more bookings for their popular stand up comedy act.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 11:34:05	Plus, though I'm not knocking the fiver a ticket, wouldn't £4.50 be more appropriate? #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 11:36:08	@vivarovers We'll either end up with two cheap games, or the usual half empty stadium on the actual day.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 16:00:01	Ex WWE tag team Too Cool are wrestling at Walkabout in Doncaster on the 19th.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 19:52:59	Snoop Dogg's son just signed with UCLA Bruins, playing alongside P Diddy's kid. In England pop stars just marry footballers.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 19:56:58	Mind you, sporting kids of pop stars wouldn't be so glamorous in Britain, one of S Club 7's kids would sign for Accrington.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 21:28:03	Apparently today is World Cancer Day. I've had that thanks, wasn't that fussed about it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 20:12:42	@DONNYDIVArl Same happens in Donny, except the badger is replaced by a drunk.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 11:32:06	#DRFC to celebrate Coppinger's 450th appearance with £5 entry. Except he's crocked, so it won't be number 450.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 13:14:33	@jonesthescribe It's a good thing it says Fab 4 or the article would be about some bugger scrawling the Inspiral Carpets on a wall.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 21:55:10	Been watching Tuesday Night Titans on WWE Network this week. Imagine the venom if Lord Alfred Hayes was on tv in the internet age.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 21:59:53	So far on Tuesday Night Titans we've had Andre singing, Piper piping &amp; Jesse Ventura come within an inch of calling Hogan a wanker.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 22:01:43	They have cooking segments too, Ivan Putski made kielbasa, Tito Santana did burritos &amp; Hogan made er...a protein shake.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 22:08:27	@ned1984 They were always bad. Had one on a video. One camera, bad lighting, it was like watching TNA.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 22:20:12	Someone tell the Daily Mirror that's not a jet.  http://t.co/OLmF9Nsfdg
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 08:20:18	No school today or tomorrow. 15 kids sent home ill yesterday and now half the teachers are off sick. Welcome to Ebola Primary.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 08:25:44	.@twounfortunates series on gender &amp; Football this week has been great. Another fine entry today by @_teaandabiscuit  http://t.co/VZreNA7NAn
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 08:31:31	@_teaandabiscuit A great read, as they all have been. Shows there's still plenty of work to do.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 09:11:19	Neil Redfearn up for manager of the month. Mainly as it's the first time in ages that Leeds United have had a manager for a whole month.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 09:22:57	@robhornby Done mate, good luck with it, would certainly be deserved.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 09:26:39	Wrestling returns to Doncaster Dome tomorrow for the first time since the demise of 1PW, with @MegaslamUK 's 6th anniversary show.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 09:28:36	On the card, El Ligero, CJ Banks, Frankie Sloan, Saraya Knight, Lana Austin, The Hooligans plus World of Sport legend Johnny Kidd.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 09:39:04	@robhornby I'm sure we will. Where are you heading on Saturday?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 09:45:21	@robhornby Not tempted by the ballet? More culture at Heanor! I'm off to Shaw Lane v Flackwell Heath in the Vase if it's on.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 10:00:02	@robhornby We've mostly escaped snow in Donny but pitches have been frozen solid. Fingers crossed for the weekend.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 11:15:30	How did school being closed today mean all the kids have to come to our house? I'm sensing an emergency I must attend....in the pub.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 23:11:05	Bob Orton just walked out with a horse. The horse may be the 1st 80's WWF star not on steroids.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 23:17:30	@UncladScamMail I think drugs were the last thing Piper ever needed.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 23:22:19	Salvatore Bellomo is on this episode. "I'm very quiet and people can't understand what I say". He went on to become Roman Reigns.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 23:24:54	@switzr1 Maybe they put the horse in a blender, then shared it out to the rest of the roster.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 23:28:09	Vince now has Sal Bellomo making pizza. Bellomo was Belgian.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 23:31:16	@switzr1 This is a few weeks after that. The ships were amazing. Could do with a show like this on the network now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-04 23:44:15	Next episode has The Iron Sheik. I hope he's cooking
Vince "What are you making Sheik?"
Sheik "I make no good pig fuck jabroni Hogan humble"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 00:15:39	@switzr1 Ha! You're probably right.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 12:07:57	Watching last night's #WWENXT . What on Earth is going on with Baron Corbin's navel?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 12:09:59	@BalorGuy @MegaslamUK Should be good, a few top wrestlers coming in alongside their great regulars. Looking forward to it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 12:37:20	Onto the Balor-Itami match from #WWENXT . I'm distracted by the ref, he's far too busy. Keep out of the way.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 13:57:18	60 ill now with Norovirus at Little 'Un's school. Good thing I always go there in a biohazard suit.   http://t.co/0rleQMQeC9
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 14:55:00	@switzr1 The Katy Perry halftime show the other night probably. Loads of shark things on here since.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 14:56:31	@thepxd Looks like an elevator shaft.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 17:13:06	@jonesthescribe "Idiot" 500 times. Job done.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 19:08:42	Wife out with her friend who's joining the army. Usually people need a tour in the Middle East to prepare for a night out in Doncaster.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 20:57:00	Easy for Wigan in the Rugby League. But for 2 unforced errors losing them a try &amp; gifting 1 to Widnes, it'd be all over.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 20:57:44	Nice to see the refs still making it up as they go along though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-05 20:59:58	@JCWatkin He'd be brilliant.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 08:35:26	#DRFC with a funny one today, fans can win pies in a "Pie Row Party". Made me smile.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 08:42:49	Doncaster Football today, #DRFC at home to Walsall plus Thorne v Westella at 3 and Denaby United v @bawtry_fc at 230.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 08:44:59	I'm off to Barnsley again today, continuing the NCEL run to Wembley with @SLAquaFC v Flackwell Heath. Should be another cracker.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 08:47:20	.@twounfortunates series on gender &amp; Football continues with @vivarovers on the administration of Women's Football  http://t.co/NkNXynKVy5
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 08:51:24	The gender &amp; Football series on @twounfortunates this week has been excellent. Go read them all if you've missed them.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 10:10:21	At least it's not pulling a ridiculous duck face pout "@drfc_official: #Selfie !!! http://t.co/Bc0CcxJiuU "
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 09:29:39	@chaskynyrd I almost can't take the glamour.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 09:35:50	Another one from last night, great to see this bloke, World Of Sport legend Johnny Kidd. http://t.co/7paZTSj3GO
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 09:44:39	@Lily_McSnarly Almost 60 but still flew around like he's in his twenties.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 09:52:59	Asked Little 'Un if he's coming to the Football. "It's a bit nippy for me I'll watch it on the telly".
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 09:53:43	I like how he thinks Shaw Lane would be live on TV.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 10:00:46	@ChrisHayes1975 Barnsley Cricket ground is part of the Shaw Lane complex so there's a chance of Dickie in the nets.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 10:04:22	@ChrisHayes1975 Quite a good set up there, hope you enjoy it. Should be a good game too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 10:56:23	So the GCHQ Internet surveillance has been ruled unlawful. Cue the government retroactively changing the law.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 19:05:01	Quite a queue for the Wrestling. Some kids have made signs too. Never seen that at an indy.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 14:07:29	At Shaw Lane, pint in the clubhouse, Spurs v Arsenal on TV in between views over the Cricket ground towards Barnsley. I love Saturdays.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 14:15:12	@JordWildey Looks a mess. What is it with knackered pitches in Barnsley?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 14:17:14	Rossington Main game off,unsurprising with the state of the pitch at Worsbrough "@9HOLMESEY9: @pete_murden @NCEL http://t.co/mPdcvxOPup"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 14:19:09	@JordWildey Be weeks before they can play on that. Makes this rugby field at Shaw Lane look like Wembley.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 14:22:38	Flackwell Heath fan -"Ground is a bit tight isn't it?"
Local " Where does tha play cocker? Wembley? Old Trafford?"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 14:26:00	Possibly a new statistic for @footballspoon , today is my 2nd game in a row with a wedding reception in the bar.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 14:47:10	Watched a few minutes of Rugby Union on the pitch next door. Saw 2 tries. Hopefully as prolific in the football.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 15:01:01	All set to go, Shaw Lane Aquaforce v Flackwell Heath in the FA Vase 5th Round.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 15:07:06	Ref having a word with the Shaw Lane players after a few early 'Welcome to Yorkshire' tackles.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 15:12:25	11' Shaw Lane 1 Flackwell Heath 0, quick passing dumbfounded the Heathens defence and an easy tap in. #favase
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 15:36:07	Flackwell Heath have it in the net but it's offside. Still 1 - 0 Shaw Lane #favase
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 15:38:41	37' Shaw Lane 1 Flackwell Heath 1. Not offside this time, initial shot well saved but rebound banged in #favase
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 15:50:25	HT Shaw Lane Aquaforce 1 Flackwell Heath 1 #favase
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 15:55:19	Good first half, quite a few chances for both teams. Very physical,  will be surprised if it ends 11 v 11.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 20:13:51	6 man tag next, Max Fury, Simon Rose &amp; Josh Anderson v Jack Dynamo, Owen Cross &amp; Robbie McKenzie.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 20:30:04	Dynamo backflip off the top rope onto both Fury and Anderson for the win. Once again Jack Dynamo impressed. Watch out for this kid.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 20:33:07	World Of Sport rules match, Ringo Ryan v the legendary Johnny Kidd.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 20:55:30	Johnny Kidd wins 2 falls to 1. That was fantastic to see. Kidd put Ryan in holds and said who used to do that hold. "Les Kellet!"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 20:57:54	Interval time, great stuff so far. There's a bloke in a daft uniform walking around selling ice cream. "Shit gimmick that mate" said 1 bloke
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 16:13:52	53' Shaw Lane 1 Flackwell Heath 2, Aquaforce fell asleep at the back, easy goal for the visitors. #favase
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 16:30:55	70' Shaw Lane 2 Flackwell Heath 2, rocket free kick from Joe Thornton from the edge of the box. #favase
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 16:32:27	GOAL! 72' Shaw Lane 3 Flackwell Heath 2, Lee Morris finishes after shots fly in from all over. #favase
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 16:35:12	Handbags, more cards. Saturdays are ace.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 16:55:04	FT Shaw Lane Aquaforce 3 Flackwell Heath 2 #favase
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 21:37:00	El Diablo gets a pin with his feet on the ropes but match awarded to Romeo via DQ. Good fun.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 21:38:25	El Diablo grabs the mic and declares "I will never, ever, wrestle in this shithole again"
Bless him
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 22:05:05	Bully Boy Carter wins after Paul Malen accidentally KO's Isit with a chair. Chairs, kendo sticks and thumbtacks all involved.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 22:06:59	She's here. Saraya Knight v Lana Austin.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 22:10:05	Saraya has hit the ring announcer, spat on a heckler, now starting on a woman in the crowd. She's bloody great.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 22:11:46	Lana Austin arrives after Saraya has already taken on half of Doncaster
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 23:47:12	Home late, but well worth it. Great job from @MegaslamUK . Happy birthday.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 00:01:23	The Queen of Wrestling, Saraya Knight on the prowl in Doncaster tonight. http://t.co/04PyoG0fC8
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 00:01:48	Ref bump! http://t.co/Iew0dm0iUk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 00:02:54	Prince Ameen with a bribe to lose for El Ligero. http://t.co/khoJeGkGGS
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 00:04:07	Line of the night from El Diablo, "I will never, ever, wrestle in this shithole again" http://t.co/tnxcKR6Pyz
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 17:23:50	Enjoyed the game today, some decent football for that pitch, kicking lumps out of each other and a good ref letting them get on with it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 17:46:27	Singing Ipswich Town fans get on the train at Rotherham. Few better reasons to sing than leaving Rotherham.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 00:22:19	@LincolnMariner Yes, at Doncaster Dome.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 00:26:30	@LincolnMariner Packed out which was good to see.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 00:28:27	@chuckie_css Haha! Tons of indies over here. Two more shows within a 30 minutes drive of me this weekend.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 00:30:05	@BullyBoyCarter Great stuff from you all tonight. Maybe use blu-tac next time!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 00:32:06	@chuckie_css They're 2 of the best ones. @ThisIs_Progress &amp; @SouthsideWE are good too. Worth a look on youtube for some of their shows.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 00:35:37	@chuckie_css It's a shame it's hard to see in the US. British Wrestling is probably the best it's ever been right now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 00:39:29	@chuckie_css Best podcast for British Wrestling is @TheIndyCorner .Has news on all the top shows &amp; regular interviews too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 00:41:12	@MegaslamUK Thoroughly enjoyed it, great stuff all night. Good turnout too, hope they all come &amp; watch again.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 00:42:17	@MegaslamUK Of course, but only 140 characters on here &amp; indy fits!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 00:44:01	@chuckie_css Almost 1am. Heading to bed shortly.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-07 18:52:18	2 NCEL teams in the FA Vase quarter finals. Better start planning a trip to Wembley.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 11:55:58	Watched Lucha Underground, out comes El Patron at the end. Watched ROH, out comes El Patron at the end. He's on more shows than @Ligero1
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 11:59:04	@TheIndyCorner I'm not sure it is actually. Off to watch him at one of his two tonight.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 12:07:03	@TheIndyCorner Yes, should be good. A few veterans on, the Knights, Frankie Sloan, James Mason. All people I haven't seen for a few years.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 06:58:05	The Internet appears to be wrong, it says the Leafs won last night. There's even a clearly fake video and everything.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 07:02:31	That's the first Leafs win since a friend brought me a pendant &amp; mini hockey stick from Toronto. I was ready to burn them.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 17:59:38	In the pub for one before the Wrestling. Never liked it down here. Cinema, restaurants etc but horrendous to access on foot &amp; barely lit.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 18:00:53	The only way to see from Doncaster Dome to the Cheswold pub is by the headlights of cars you hope don't hit you.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 18:03:34	Realised picking up my ticket why I haven't been to The Dome in ages. Upcoming shows, Chubby Brown, Chuckle Brothers &amp; a Billy Joel tribute.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 18:15:03	Looking forward to tonight's show. Saraya Knight v Lana Austin should be great, plus the obligatory El Ligero match.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 18:17:38	@justinruff Haven't seen her live for a while. Always great to watch. Scares me a bit though!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 18:21:24	@justinruff I once sat with Sandman in a pub all night and had a barbed wire covered Abyss land in my lap. Pussycats next to Saraya.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 19:49:55	Opening match, El Ligero v Prince Ameen in front of a full house.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 20:10:27	El Ligero pins Prince Ameen. Great match to start the night.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 20:44:03	1st fall in Round 2 to Johnny Kidd. This is magical. I'm 8 years old again.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 21:22:58	2nd half underway with El Diablo v former champion Mick Romeo.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 21:39:50	Title match next. Hardcore Match, champion Terry Isit v Bully Boy Carter with Paul Malen as special referee.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 22:23:35	Lana Austin beats Saraya Knight,  who remains a genius.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 22:25:55	Last match. CJ Banks &amp; Frankie Sloan v The Hooligans
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-06 22:40:47	Sloan &amp; Banks win. Great show overall, good matches all the way.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 13:17:37	@jacklang It probably isn't a big deal, he's been walking for 50 years. Now, Stephen Hawking walking down the street...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 21:36:08	If MVP keeps mentioning how fragile Kurt Angle's knees are, WWE will never give him a last run. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 21:40:46	@magillaposition Can't see it either. Must be enough to drive him to drink...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 21:42:15	@harlequinskiss He's too beat up for 6 months at WWE, add in the alcohol issues he's had and there's no chance he'll  be back there.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 21:51:57	Went to the loo &amp; return to see a different ring &amp; a different building. Have they joined Gorilla Monsoon at the Rosemont Horizon? #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 21:57:57	Little more than a squash match. Odd #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 22:11:31	Josh Matthews points out the fatal flaw in the booking of this match. Whole point of the cage is to stop outside interference #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 22:25:02	Now #impactuk have gone with Mark Andrews as Mandrews, I imagine Drew McIntyre will have to be Drewmans.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 22:30:48	This is all going to end with Spud kicking EC3 through a barber shop window. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 22:47:36	After Mandrews, I hope Samoa Joe changes his name to Manboobs. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 22:59:21	That was two hours I'd have been better spending stabbing my testicles. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 23:13:41	I very rarely bet, but a friend persuaded me to do 1 of those 6 fold things today. If Santos hold on for 10 minutes, it comes in.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 23:14:56	I'll only win about 40 quid, so not retiring on it, but better than a kick in the teeth.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 16:37:54	@WWFShow Christen Press
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 16:39:11	Watching Rangers v Raith. Rovers just went ahead with a goal that really needed the Benny Hill music.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 16:25:13	Little ' Un back at school today. Incredibly went a whole day without an epidemic breaking out.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 16:42:25	@jonesthescribe @DonnyFreePress Who was the first David Jones and what did you do with him?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 16:59:07	@Nic_Nik If that wasn't a sign of his drug problems I don't know what was.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 17:01:31	After seeing a pic of a Kardashian dressed as Ric Flair at the Grammys I'm disappointed she didn't start bleeding then fight Dusty Rhodes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 17:57:38	France v USA Women is the 3rd game I've watched today &amp; by far the best. 0-0 but a few good chances for both teams.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 18:17:32	2-0 France. Quite a start to the 2nd half. Long trip home for the Americans coming up.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 17:28:27	@peter27afcb Our local paper is full of letters just like that one. Always surprises me that they can write a whole letter.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 18:56:31	@Saintbarca Yes, I've seen them a couple of times. They'll be hard to beat.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 19:44:41	Michael Palin appears to be on the line at Bradford v Franchise.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 20:29:17	If Bradford could finish they would probably even beat Chelsea. Oh, right...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 21:09:37	#impactuk on. I've seen more imposing looking cages keeping chickens in on the allotments down the road.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 21:11:51	@magillaposition I don't mind it, it's an acknowledgement that it's pro wrestling &amp; it exists beyond the world of 'sports entertainment'
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 21:14:05	@magillaposition Should always put your own company above others.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-08 21:20:50	Wobbly cameras, no lights and a half arsed cage. Is this internationally televised #impactuk or NWA Redneck on youtube?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 21:20:47	@JaimsVanDerBeek Thanks for the reminder, I hadn't done it today. *clench*
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 21:22:09	@charlielard Looks like a promo picture for a new ITV detective drama.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 22:44:46	Rikishi going in the WWE Hall of Fame, Reigns headlining 'Mania. The Anoa'i family have photos don't they?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 22:50:25	Rikishi gets the Hall of Fame, his old mates Too Cool are wrestling at Walkabout in Doncaster next week. Them's the breaks.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 23:57:59	@BCAFCBH I voted for "Something by The Proclaimers"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 23:59:32	The Scottish FA holding a vote on what to use as an anthem. So much fun to be had. https://t.co/7teka1hivr
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 00:05:00	So far on the Scottish football anthem vote, I've gone for The Proclaimers &amp; There's a Moose Loose Aboot This Hoose.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 00:28:42	@chrisjonty I'd love to read some of the answers.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 12:06:47	#favase draw just made, Shaw Lane Aquaforce at home to Glossop North End or Dunston &amp; Tadcaster Albion away to Highworth Town. #NCEL
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 12:13:55	Decent draw for the NCEL teams, Tadcaster away but should win. Tough opponents for Shaw Lane but at home you'd fancy them against Barcelona.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 12:21:34	@DolphinHotel Tough enough for Dunston at Glossop before thinking about Shaw Lane. I fancy North Shields for the final.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-09 12:25:11	@DolphinHotel It's looking that way.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 16:28:23	@jonesthescribe As a bit of a lefty myself it's a disgrace that she'd have that. I mean who still uses a Blackberry?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 19:55:27	So, sat home watching Barcelona. Not as good as Brodsworth...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 20:18:01	Giving @RockBottomRadFM a listen for the first time. So far so good.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 22:47:12	@RockBottomRadFM Only managed to listen to the first hour but really enjoyed it. Definitely be listening again.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 22:50:48	@RockBottomRadFM I shall keep an eye out for it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 23:15:50	Going to strain myself and stay up for the NXT show. Usually on WWE ppv's there's maybe 1 match I want to see, tonight has 3.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 09:09:36	Saw the 30 pass Forrester goal for #DRFC at Crawley. It's almost certain after about 10 passes someone shouted "Gerrit in t'chuffin box!"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 09:24:07	Wife just rang after dropping the kids at school, 4 horses wandering loose down the road, heading towards the railway crossing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 09:34:19	Lots to do today, (doctors, comic book work, maybe eat), but as I fell asleep just before, I'm first watching Zayn v Owens from last night.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 09:46:56	Wife said "Don't bother getting me a Valentine's card". That means buy the best one in town or there'll be trouble doesn't it?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 09:48:05	Who's bright idea was it to have Valentine's Day when the Rovers are at home anyway?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 10:08:21	Enjoyed Zayn v Owens. Good to see something different with the finish and perfectly set up for a rematch.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 10:09:37	@ChillMascaras Why what?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 10:12:46	@knockernorton1 At least I'd get some peace and quiet if she didn't talk to me for the weekend!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 10:14:49	@ChillMascaras Haha! Same reason I watch Jaws every time it's on TV, you know how it goes but it's fun anyway.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 09:41:27	Is £4.4billion the new Premier League TV deal or the estimated price of a season ticket in 10 years?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 00:27:22	Somewhere in deepest Mexico, El Generico gathers all the kids in the orphanage together to watch Zayn v Owens... #NXTTakeOver
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 00:32:38	@UncladScamMail Steen is parked outside the orphanage, eating a burrito at the wheel of a truck full of ladders, waiting.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 00:34:47	I hope Renee Young hides a dark secret, no one can really be that sweet. #NXTTakeOver
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 00:40:12	Tonight, Finn Balor will surely appear painted as a Seth Rollins dick pic #NXTTakeOver
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 00:42:01	Owens wearing a jacket. Either in court earlier or he's been to a funeral #NXTTakeOver
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 01:04:56	Mini Cole on commentary again. #NXTTakeOver
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 01:07:39	Tyler Breeze's selfie stick is the copyright of Ken Dodd #NXTTakeOver
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 01:09:52	I like Tyler Breeze. He's rare among modern heels in that you really want him to get his head kicked in #NXTTakeOver
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 01:12:24	@iLikeDazzyLea He's a bit dull.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 10:35:43	This time last year I was having chemotherapy with the fine people at Weston Park Hospital. Go follow @WPCancerCharity &amp; help them out.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 10:39:07	Barnsley have sacked Danny Wilson. Because having a new manager every 5 minutes stops you being rubbish doesn't it?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 10:41:36	@ChillMascaras I enjoy NXT, never been a big fan of Steen though. A bit one dimensional and his gear looks like he can't be bothered.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 10:46:21	@TopRopeElbow @KingBingus I just did the same at that picture.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 10:49:00	Have to feel sorry for Robbie X in that pic. Last time I saw Rampage Brown he hit me with Mark Haskins.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 10:55:48	Prince Andrew has been made a Vice Admiral, which means he can tell vice cops to stop investigating him.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 11:56:10	@BarcaJim I couldn't date her, not because of the kinky sex but because of her shitty taste in books.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 01:25:15	Corbin is the ultimate WWE sports entertainer, dull ex college athlete who always wins. #NXTTakeOver
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 01:29:40	Blake &amp; Murphy, the World Heavyweight Val Venis Lookalike Champions #NXTTakeOver
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 02:01:08	Well, Balor v Neville was gorgeous. Never mind the rest of the show, just rerun that for an hour. #NXTRival
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 13:01:29	Went for a haircut, the ultimate procrastination.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 13:02:38	That's my second haircut in a month. Along with the disappearance of the beard I'm almost approaching respectability.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 13:22:40	Valentine's cards in Clintons are 'Buy 3 get 1 free'. Good value for the more adulterous shopper.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 12:55:00	Watching last night's WWE Raw. Daniel Bryan said wrestling. Disgraceful language.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 14:21:38	@vivarovers @MikeSFollows @DanBonnett Will do, no problem.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 15:04:51	Went in the Tesco on the High Street, just 4 days before Valentine's, all their flowers look dead. No one loves Tesco.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 15:09:17	Those Seth Rollins pics make you wonder what's actually in that briefcase.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 15:11:11	@vivarovers Ha! They should be. Especially as I only went in for some beanburgers.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 15:26:17	@markusparkus75 @vivarovers Tastier &amp; more nutritious than most other things they sell too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 15:28:42	Waiting for the washing machine to finish. Even for a Tuesday, today hasn't been a classic.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 15:29:49	Mind you, I did see a fire engine.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 15:34:22	@mophead_88 Can you imagine that meeting? "OK guys, we need a huge name to start of the season &amp; draw a crowd. How about St.Mirren?"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 15:41:23	@mophead_88 Who'd have thought it of St.Mirren. Though I was quite excited 2 years ago when Doncaster arranged a friendly v Motherwell.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 16:14:10	@rainedonparade @jonesthescribe That's the King of the Owlmen instructing his minions, (all owls in human disguises), on the invasion plan.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 09:08:40	Getting some football in tonight, @BRODSWORTHWAFC v Appleby Frodingham in the CMFL. Plenty of layers and a bottle of anti freeze.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 09:16:06	@BRODSWORTHWAFC @THE66POW Don't spend all the gate receipts at once.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 09:57:31	Watching the Pakistan v England Cricket on a PTV stream. Every tv ad in Pakistan seems to be for mobile phones.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 10:39:26	Pakistan need 74 off 10 overs. Piece of cake unless England get Ul Haq out sharpish.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 17:14:05	#DRFC twitter used the word 'banter'. Don't let it happen again
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 11:24:19	England lose. Best get used to that over the next couple of weeks.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 11:41:54	The Vasilevskiy save for Tampa Bay last night was ridiculous: http://t.co/95IrnaBFed
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 11:50:51	Last rt is a good read, though I can't help but think the trend of half arsed football ultras will soon go the way of inflatable bananas.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 11:51:48	They'll soon learn that supporting your team is not supposed to be fun.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 11:53:02	@PayasoDeMierda I did yes, good stuff. Never underestimate the easy access of thickos noses.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 11:55:41	Go wave your tifo at this from the other day on Football ultras by @PayasoDeMierda   http://t.co/cOol26PkTm
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 11:58:32	@PayasoDeMierda Always a fine line between those wanting to wave flags or flares &amp; those finding an excuse for 80's style punch ups.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 12:04:07	Scudamore says it's not up to clubs to pay staff a living wage. Dick by name, dick by nature.  http://t.co/pp7Qf5XAVm
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 17:58:23	@JoeBillGibbo @yorkpress Was it a hair raising robbery?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 19:15:24	@DrMuttley Only a matter of time before they call Coppinger 'bae'.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 19:53:30	#Leafs say they're going to rebuild. How much Lego does a Phaneuf get you these days?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 20:03:04	Time to watch a bit of Salford 0 v St Helens.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 21:30:03	@drfc_official Surely only Kyle Bennett would fit in the envelope.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 18:43:29	The £5bn+ Premier League rights has people calling louder for ticket price reductions. Won't happen. Your tv subs will go up too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 18:44:39	The only way people can change things in football is don't pay those ticket prices, don't buy tv subs.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 21:47:06	Salford clearly no good at Rugby League. They're not even good comedy. Maybe they should try magic or juggling...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 22:05:24	New Japan catchup, haven't watched since WK9. Surprised I haven't started shaking or come out in a rash.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 22:14:17	Thoughts and best wishes for @amylouiseusher . Keep on going and keep on inspiring. #HockeyFamilySticksTogether
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 19:00:52	Fingers crossed for #DRFC picking up a point at least tonight. We'll of course be up against the inevitable Lee Fowler goal for Crawley.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 19:03:38	@MJ_Lethal Not a penny for us. If a club gets up there they inevitably piss away the cash on overpriced journeymen &amp; end up in League 1.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 19:30:34	Put FCUM v Barwell on and they're playing "Let's Go Fly A Kite". Punk Football makes way for Old Musicals Football.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 16:55:39	@peter27afcb How many kids start drinking and smoking because the Police have shown them which shops will serve them?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 20:33:32	@kellysue Adenomyosis, the lining of the uterus grows into the muscle.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-12 23:14:34	@aleavelle Looks right up my street. Look forward to reading more.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 06:55:59	Non uniform day at school. Little 'Un has picked out a Superman t shirt, (with cape), and his lucha mask.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 20:42:10	#DRFC 1 up at halftime. Fowler still warming the bench so plenty of time for swearing later.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 21:04:14	#DRFC 2-0 up and Rossington 1-0 up at Nostell in the county cup replay.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 21:07:17	@vivarovers Hope Springs Eternal? Is that the real ale of choice for Fowler these days?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 08:21:58	@Okwonga It would have to be Oligarch Country Estate and Tax Evasion Carribean Island.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 08:40:26	@glenglenglen It's a bit like waiting for a Belles season ticket to be processed.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 08:46:35	@Rich_Colby The fake Sting was Heath Slater apparently.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 08:47:58	@DennisCricket_ Obviously hoping the Ian Botham preparation method does the trick.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 09:20:49	New #DRFC signing Abdul Razak says "You'll enjoy watching me". Doesn't he realise we're not meant to enjoy it?   http://t.co/4n6ZWxZRqk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 09:23:24	@jonesthescribe Hopefully including classic punk bands Butthole Surfers and The Dickies.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 09:26:18	@markusparkus75 @jonesthescribe Plus something by Willie Nelson.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 10:12:34	@Rich_Colby Current stuff is mostly horrendous. Love the network for the archive though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 10:16:09	@Rich_Colby TNA is a bit hit and miss, some great stuff then it's horrendous. Next few episodes recorded in UK, usually more fun.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 10:18:20	@WWFShow Adult single and a Beaver to Milton Keynes please driver.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 10:28:30	Fortune-West added to the #DRFC legends game. Sadly 90% of the crowd will be confusedly chanting "Louis, Louis"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 10:33:40	@dazdrfc21 Especially at £21 for a kid's ticket.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 10:35:39	@jonesthescribe That pic is the only time anyone actually saw him in a Dons shirt.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 19:44:14	Missing the football as the bus didn't turn up. Wife will have to cancel the strippers she ordered now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 19:53:09	@mophead_88 So you came to Doncaster, where it doesn't.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-11 20:19:00	@Saintbarca But how will the club owners pay for their second yacht?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 21:41:14	#DRFC 5-0 at Crawley. Looks like they'll win the set and face Andy Murray in the next round.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-10 21:57:55	@DennisCricket_ You can do the same at Lords, as long as you're not a woman.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 11:40:29	Always comforting when the pharmacist looks at your tablets and says "Ooh, I haven't seen these before"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 15:57:15	Friday night, to beer or not to beer, that's the question.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 16:07:42	A few golden oldies in the #DRFC legends game, &amp; another tomorrow at @BCollieryfc . Neil Grayson still plays for opponents Glapwell aged 50
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 19:23:48	England v USA football then NZ v Sri Lanka in the Cricket World Cup opener. That's tonight sorted.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 19:33:26	Disappointing that the BBC coverage of England v USA is relegated to the website. Got to show those all important soaps &amp; Dr Who repeats.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 19:36:14	Can we have Valentine's every week? Picked up a bottle of wine half price. Very nice it is too. Might grab another at halftime.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 19:39:58	Maybe the Beeb aren't showing the England game as it's at MK. BBC goes AMF.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 19:49:36	@vivarovers "New Pop Stand, with free authentic Jack the Ripper Whitechapel rain! Just a pound!"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:06:30	@jonesthescribe Owls are attacking people in Oregon. I knew your pic was evidence of a plot to take over.   http://t.co/ZCJcM6D2I1
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:12:46	Eoin Morgan finds a ball the England batsmen can hit ahead of tonight's World Cup opener. @DennisCricket_ http://t.co/9oBqFkaa5Q
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:19:54	@JoeBillGibbo Sadly, you're probably right.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:21:23	@martinjobling Hopefully a few changes and improvement means we do OK. Maybe good to get a bad performance out of the way tonight.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:25:21	@martinjobling France looked very good against the US the other night. That's about it for winners though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:27:35	@martinjobling Certainly makes it more interesting.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:31:29	I bet @switzr1 is already glued to the Cricket World Cup.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:33:35	@footballspoon I played there once. Rugby League though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:46:33	A New Zealand accent saying "The first six of the World Cup" makes me think I should watch on TV rather than listen to @bbctms
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:47:18	@RudyardKipling7 @ALouCoo I'll look out for that, haven't seen it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:56:03	@theraithrover I'm hoping for an hour of watching McCullum and the kids waking me up before England have lost in the morning.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:57:25	@Delaware_Dolfan Isn't it dangerous fighting fires without a shirt or helmet?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 23:07:13	@ALouCoo @RudyardKipling7 There's bound to be a company making &amp; marketing those spikes to shops. Some evil bastard saw a money maker.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 23:10:44	@footballspoon We won that day. Played them a while after at Sale RU too in a cup game. Probably couldn't pay the bills at Alty.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 23:12:10	@RudyardKipling7 @ALouCoo Might be worth a Google. Probably a protest against the manufacturers already.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 23:15:42	@RudyardKipling7 @ALouCoo Just saw a Vice article on people pouring concrete over spikes at a London Tesco. Good idea.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 23:17:07	65 for McCullum. Are Sri Lanka allowed to play now too? #CWC15
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 20:11:40	@AliceRadley Best wishes Alice. Don't forget to send Bolin the bill.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 20:33:22	England 1-0 down. Go home Yankees!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 20:44:06	In possession England are crowded in the middle. Player like Carney out wide and they're rarely using her. USA look very comfortable.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 20:50:37	@rainedonparade They just had the ball out wide and created a half chance. Need more of it. Sat too deep in defence as well.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 20:54:26	@rainedonparade Looks like we're just trying not to get a hiding. Set up like a non league team got Man Utd in the cup.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 20:58:46	Watching a Fox Sports stream rather than BBC for a different point of view. The Americans certainly do Women's Football better than we do.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 23:34:19	The wine I'm drinking comes from Isla Negra, Chile, where Pablo Neruda lived. I doubt it will make my twitter poetic.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 23:35:25	@DrMuttley With a replacement bladder too. Need an Olympic event.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 23:38:13	@fabulousjasonv Worcester Sauce. Your grilled cheese life will never be the same again.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 23:39:26	@switzr1 Really? That's obscene. Make friends with an Indian family.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 00:00:01	@WWFShow I reckon @Pirates should arrange a replacement to cancel out that Friday 13th luck.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 00:13:08	Plenty of people do those accumulator football bets every Saturday. Mug's game. Friend who got me to do one never wins.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 00:15:15	Trick is to pick top v bottom of a league, no away teams. All short odds, but a small win beats a loss. Nothing fits? Don't bet.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 00:39:22	Valentine's Day, #DRFC v Yeovil later. Hand over a quid, I'll give you the new Popular Stand and my undying love. http://t.co/uc43S278J2
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 00:43:33	Off to bed. I'll be dreaming of you buying the fanzine, or asking if it's the programme. 2pm-ish at the Keepmoat. It's a date #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 00:44:02	@RudyardKipling7 I'll be waiting. Hugs.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 00:45:35	@RudyardKipling7 An arm round the missus shortly will feel awkward now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:04:04	All 4 presenters and pundits on Fox Sports are female too. Beeb usually throw Sue Smith next to a male lower league journeyman.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:06:52	@GilharrenD US out of season too Darren.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:11:55	@GilharrenD I think our problem has been setting up not to get a beating. Sat too deep in defence &amp; crowded midfield in possession.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:12:35	@martinjobling Very true. Embarrassing for us when the Yanks do it better.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:14:05	@Blondie951 @Delaware_Dolfan @debswim2010 I think it's a US problem. I've seen Americans with delayed tweets/notifications for a few days.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:18:45	@debswim2010 @Blondie951 @Delaware_Dolfan Waiting for one saying how well Johnny Unitas played last night.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:20:55	Cracking shot from Kirby. Wasn't offside at all, not even close.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:23:30	@GirlsontheBall Not even close. Throw some binoculars down to the linesman.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:35:58	@rainedonparade Linesman are all blind, referees all illegitimate.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:37:39	@UncladScamMail Was that the crowd or the ref mic?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:39:04	@UncladScamMail Haha! Wish I was watching now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:42:44	England look set to struggle in the World Cup on this evidence. Optimism tonight only from not being stuffed.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:45:38	@rainedonparade Not much other than we're not very good.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:49:06	@rainedonparade I am, fanzine day. Stood outside harassing people for a quid in exchange for quality football writing &amp; bad jokes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:51:26	@rainedonparade Hope so, it'll be good to say hello. I'm usually around the south west corner.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:56:04	Sheffield Eagles lost at Dewsbury in their opener. Haha! #Lodgers #COYD
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 21:59:13	@jmsutton @DONNYDIVArl My Dad still does it after 40 years. He was a painter when he first left school &amp; points at buildings he worked on.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:00:51	1-0 loss for England. Poor performance overall. USA are one the top sides but barely broke a sweat.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:19:15	If you thought the England football band were annoying, try Herb Alpert &amp; The Tone Deaf Mariachi at the NZ v SL Cricket.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:39:38	@DennisCricket_ He'll need a couple more after his bacon and eggs.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 22:42:44	@RudyardKipling7 @ALouCoo Haven't seen any round my way, though the Mayor opened a £1m hotel suite days after a clampdown on rough sleepers.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 23:01:20	@theraithrover It's probably the only game we'll win, just to lull us into a false sense of security.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 23:04:23	@footballspoon Doncaster u19 v Trafford Borough, who sadly no longer exist but played there. 1st team played Chorley afterwards.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 23:27:31	Always odd drinking red wine. My head is clear as a spring morning but my legs don't work.  I can just pee in the empty bottle can't I?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-13 23:42:15	Awful shot, nice catch by Sangakara though #CWC15
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 00:06:53	Ooh! Won another of those multiple bets tonight. 30 odd quid. That's 2 in a row. Giving up now before I lose one.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 00:09:50	I know my luck will run out when the Ice Hockey game I almost added would have lost.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 00:18:10	@chrisjonty I've done 2 this week, made about £70. Tonight had Dutch 2nd div., Porto &amp; Velez from Argentina. Everyone loses on UK games.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 00:19:10	@RudyardKipling7 I bet you bet in British games?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 00:20:10	@chrisjonty Hunches and feelings don't work. That's how bookies make their millions.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 00:21:30	@JulianBarker111 Always an exception to every rule. Sometimes my Wife beats me to the packet of Hobnobs.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 00:22:51	@chrisjonty If you can't be interested just watching don't risk money on it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 00:48:38	@RudyardKipling7 Haha! The old ones are the best!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 22:53:37	@Kez122 Noticed he has me too. Don't remember slagging him off at all.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 11:16:30	28 Feyenoord fans heading to watch #DRFC v Yeovil today. What's the Dutch for "Gerrit chuffin forrard Rovers!"? http://t.co/cQCEj868tJ
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 13:38:38	@DONNYDIVArl I'm going to try that out later.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 13:41:53	Very quiet by the South Stand. Is anyone coming? It's Yeovil, we always* beat Yeovil. #DRFC

*almost never
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 18:17:46	Harry Forrester pulled his groin. In front of all those people, disgusting. #50ShadesOfHarry #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 15:24:38	21' #DRFC 1 Yeovil 0, keeper bobbles a long ramge shot &amp; Tyson taps in
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 15:56:27	#DRFC 1-0 up at halftime. Could well have been more.  Yeovil have had their moments so Rovers could do with another.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 16:20:21	57' #DRFC 2 Yeovil 0,  Furman slots in a Main cross
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 11:09:03	#DRFC at home &amp; plenty of other games  today. @thewelfare v @SLAquaFC , @BCollieryfc v Glapwell, Thorne v @BRODSWORTHWAFC &amp; Askern v @HCIFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 18:04:42	Rovers made light work of Yeovil today, 3-0. Could have been twice as many. Hardly a bad thing to say about any player.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 23:04:04	@Kez122 Who knows, maybe he's just a bit of a grinch.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 16:40:33	77' #DRFC 3 Yeovil 0, from a goal line clearance to Bennett tapping in. What a goal
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 17:34:49	@Saintbarca It would be a great game to see, especially in the new ground.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 15:48:26	@footballspoon Problem with muddy pitches nowadays is how do we admire all the illuminous pink and lime boots?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 17:25:38	@Saintbarca I'll record it and watch it the day after.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 19:03:40	Watching the latest ROH, Bobby Fish always looks like he's wearing a disguise.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 19:16:52	ODB is a great match with The Briscoes. If this was WWE they'd make her the mad sister &amp; have them lose a pig trough match v The Usos. #ROH
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-14 23:01:09	@Kez122 Neither will I, just clicked on an rt someone posted of him and saw I was blocked. Didn't follow him in the first place.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 19:58:07	Lucha Underground on, "Fenix had his 1st match aged 14" says commentary. Takes kick to the face. "And his last one right here" said my Wife.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 20:25:28	@ata_dizdar They've taken the TNA backstage bits and done it properly. I like the adjustments the AAA guys have made, not so corny as Mexico
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 20:29:02	@ata_dizdar Cuerto &amp; El Patron talked briefly at the start, more to come at the end I think. Have about 10 minutes left.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 20:56:03	@themib @WillOspreay @AJStylesOrg @RevProUK I'd love to see him have a go in Japan. Saw him v Sabre &amp; Uhaa ,he'd be perfect over there.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 21:01:22	@ata_dizdar A little bit. With the tassels I reckon a bit of a Von Erich influence.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 21:21:34	Borash's shaved head makes him look like one of the visitors from Alien Nation. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 21:41:29	It's Yersel'! #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 22:02:29	@UncladScamMail Watching that, the crowd looks better from a phone camera than it does on tv.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 22:20:36	Good to see Borash channelling his inner Jeff Hardy. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 13:52:33	Games like this Villa v Leicester one are the reason people join the Foreign Legion.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 13:57:13	Best thing about the Villa goal is it may save the world from a replay.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 22:56:08	Not sure MVP's Man Utd gear makes him that much of a villain in Glasgow. Better off with an England shirt #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 20:37:53	@ata_dizdar Texano with a rope. Should be fun.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 21:06:55	Usual British crowd. Wall to wall ICW &amp; Bullet Club shirts #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 21:17:14	@UncladScamMail They're using their chance to look special to look tinpot.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 21:40:09	"Somebody come out and stop this!" shouts Matthews. It's not as bad as last week mate #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 21:44:09	No music for Grado? Can TNA not afford a second hand Madonna Greatest Hits CD? #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 22:32:13	Here comes Matt Hardy to explain the law on getting a UK visa #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 23:07:14	#WTTV with no irony asking if social media is good or bad for Wrestling while advertising an interview with Vince Russo.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 17:24:38	Silly thing is, apart from scoring 3 goals and setting one up, Messi has done very little in this game.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 17:32:00	Great goal from Suarez, who as a bonus has been on the pitch 5 minutes without taking a chunk out of anyone.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 21:08:32	Lashley in a Glasgow ring for 2 minutes &amp; no kid has offered to watch his belt for a quid #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 21:30:50	The 2 different ringside cameras have a different hue to them, 1 blue, 1 yellow. They've bought knock offs from CEX haven't they? #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 21:45:16	@UncladScamMail That should be fun.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 21:58:15	@UncladScamMail Thanks.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 22:03:36	Favourited by the Bullet Club. #TooSweet
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 22:52:07	@ShadesVincent Or they like throwing water balloons.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 23:03:21	Some OK in ring stuff tonight but still hard to watch with the terrible production values. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 17:22:53	It wouldn't be Sunday without a Messi hat-trick.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 17:28:08	@Saintbarca Sounds like a good plan. Is it the Saints-South Sydney game next week?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 20:20:24	Son of Havoc is the Shark Boy of Lucha Underground.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 20:22:39	@ata_dizdar Certainly grew on me. The things that irritated me at first have gone, like the crowd being choreographed.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 20:58:21	#impactuk in a few minutes, start of the UK tapings. By far the biggest &amp; best crowds they ever see. Hopefully a decent show.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 21:15:32	Do you have to press the red button or something to see there's a big crowd? #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 21:57:28	Crazy Steve looks like a terrible Finn Balor cosplayer #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 22:09:43	Spud has to be the first Englishman cheered in Glasgow. Quite an achievement #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-15 22:58:41	@wrestlingfanno1 Which only annoys half the city. I know he's a fan but would have been better with a Liverpool shirt like Bully Ray did.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 10:30:43	Half term, raining. This means Despicable Me on a constant loop. I'll give my sanity until about 1 o'clock.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 11:21:34	@janhopis "Won't the rock make me look scrawny?","Maybe, but you look manly next to the moss. Focus on the moss"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 11:32:57	@themib Await the 'I was hacked' statement later.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 11:33:39	@themib Probably.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 11:36:38	If Cesaro has been hacked, at least it doesn't involve a dick pic.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 11:39:35	If Cesaro hasn't been hacked, even CM Punk is sat at home thinking "Dude, cancer?"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 11:46:47	The Cesaro hacker was probably just wasting a few minutes before meeting his lawyer about his Paige restraining order.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 11:50:34	Being hacked may at least get Cesaro a post Raw podcast with Austin.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 11:55:59	"Cesaro, all my passwords are locked up like a sumbitch at the Broken Skull Ranch, right next to a stack of brass rings for the working man"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 10:55:37	Just saw an article on a study condensing 2254 other studies concluding that 8 hours sleep is ideal. 2254 studies find what we already knew.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 10:56:18	I think that shows that most study groups need less funding and more sleep.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 11:04:22	Most Cricket news this morning is the IPL auction, not the World Cup. Ignoring competition between the best teams for a corrupt farce.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 14:45:03	@mophead_88 Parkhead can never live up to the glamour of Glasshoughton.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 14:47:48	@mophead_88 There's an Inter Stella in the Doncaster Sunday League. Must be their reserves playing Celtic.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 14:49:27	@mophead_88 Ringers. Typical Sunday League.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 14:51:21	@mophead_88 I'm at Rossington v Pontefract. Equally glamorous, picking my tuxedo up later.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 14:55:40	FA selling 'early bird' tickets for the Trophy final at £20. Goes up to 30 in March. Holding at £20 would be better, but it's a start.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 14:57:29	@mophead_88 It's a bit rough &amp; ready round there but I've been to worse places. Have fun.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 15:05:35	There's a photo comp. for the Trophy final using #myfanphoto hashtag. Obviously not for highlighting need for better grassroots funding...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 15:17:49	@JoeBillGibbo @mophead_88 Yorkshire will take the tourist coin wherever it can get it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 20:39:39	Preston v Man U is so dull it wasn't until a few minutes into the pundits punditing that I realised it was halftime.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 20:42:18	@ned1984 Don't give them any ideas.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 20:44:25	@nick_gonzo I read it earlier, yet another nail in the coffin of newspaper irrelevance.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 20:46:55	@nick_gonzo His choice of Moore and Crumb as what makes a good comic shows he hasn't really read one for 30 years.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 20:49:20	@nick_gonzo Indeed. Next week, there'll be an article on the dearth of good guitarists since Sinatra died.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 20:52:22	If this score stays the same Bobby Charlton's passport occupation will be 'Former Preston North End manager'
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 21:14:48	Good to see they've gone for the dodgy offside tonight, bored of the last minute dubious penalty
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 21:37:48	Well, they went with the dodgy penalty anyway. Refs in these games are like the Rolling Stones, wait long enough they play all the old hits.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 21:41:21	Nothing to say about Keown. As always these days, I watched the game on mute.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 22:01:56	NZ v Scotland on, where the Scots will try not to lose by a Rugby score. #CWC15
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 22:09:33	2 down for Scotland already. Could be finished by midnight.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 22:25:17	Great look at the weird &amp; wonderful world of Lucha Underground from @STEELCHAIRmag   http://t.co/Dr6ssuzflZ
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 22:26:38	Scotland have 4 down in 5 overs. They will only win this if Phil Dowd gives them a penalty.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 22:30:05	Only hope for Scotland now is if @gradowrestling is batting at number 8 #CWC15
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-16 22:31:48	@Kropotkin_alias The way Utd go through kits, it will be eventually.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 18:26:25	As well as #DRFC played on Saturday, I'm not pushing my luck tonight. Instead I'm spreading some love to @RossingtonMain v @PonteCollsFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 18:30:15	My Wife said "It's cheaper at Rosso too". It is before you take being able to watch with a pint in my hand from The Main Bar...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 18:41:31	Little 'Un likes to guess which colour team is going to win the game I'm at. Rosso wear blue, Ponte's home kit is blue. He's gone for red.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 18:42:26	@MediaActivist Happy Birthday Mr Baker.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 19:41:21	@vivarovers I'm at Rosso, so if you need a glorious night for the Main recording for posterity in lieu of a 0-0 v Crewe...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 19:45:34	@JoeBillGibbo The locals' probation doesn't allow them out after dark.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 19:47:45	Delayed kickoff at Rossington due to an injury for the referee during the warm up. Let's hope he hasn't gone blind...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 19:59:06	We have a replacement official and almost set to start.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 20:22:52	Mid 1st half, Rossington Main 0 Pontefract Collieries 0. Good end to end game, decent chances for both &amp; the replacement ref doing well
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 20:49:10	Rosso keeper @JordWildey  being replaced after being clogged. Made several good saves &amp; Ponte took him out
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 20:52:26	Ball ended up in the net, but despite whistle not blown for a foul, it's not allowed. Arguments all round.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 20:54:05	HT Rossington Main 0 Pontefract Collieries 0. Really good game, Ponte with the best of it but Rosso with chances. Add chaotic refs &amp; stir.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 21:01:36	@rainedonparade Thought that might happen tonight. Only so long you can keep winning easily.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 21:03:03	2nd half underway. Ref started well but lost it at the end. Let's see what this half brings.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 21:19:18	Away fan shouted "C'mon Ponte keep ratting". Awaiting a sub with a torch, a Jack Russell and a gun.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 21:32:19	Ponte fans scream for a penalty, "HANDBALL!" This ref is deaf, not blind.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 21:39:24	Ponte fan shouted "Ref! You only booking them in fuckin' purple?" I pointed out his team are in claret &amp; blue. Another good reason I'm 6'2"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 21:53:08	FT Rossington Main 0 Pontefract Collieries 0. One of those 0-0 games that couldn't be more fun if it was 6-6
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 22:22:04	@JordWildey They moaned all 2nd half, made out they'd have won if you hadn't gone down.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 22:37:45	@JordWildey Everyone worked hard tonight, deserved the point. You feeling OK?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 22:38:43	@rainedonparade Great win. I'd have been happy with a draw tonight.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 22:43:51	@JordWildey Hopefully wears off soon then. Can't be showing off with one legged saves on Saturday.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 23:29:21	Public transport in Doncaster is magical. Almost 2 hours to get home. Walked the last leg to make it quicker.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 23:32:42	Trip home made quicker listening to @JRsBBQ's interview with Adam Cole. Good stuff. What did we do before podcasts?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 23:33:29	@rainedonparade Now if I'd gone it would have been 0-0.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 23:38:51	Welcome to Rosso. Nice touch with this poster at @RossingtonMain http://t.co/RtX7voCHYe
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 23:43:17	@ata_dizdar I always used to listen to talk or sports radio. Rarely do now with podcasts instead.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 23:47:00	@rainedonparade I think that's 1 of the better things lately, not afraid of hoofing it once in a while. Can't always score with 39 passes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-18 14:53:27	@FudgeLuke @JDFOTH Untrue. He was fouled in the attack which saw the ball in the net. Was subbed after being unable to bear weight on 1 leg
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-18 14:54:23	@FudgeLuke @JDFOTH It was the 2nd foul on him within a few minutes, a Ponte player was booked for the 1st challenge.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-18 14:57:52	@FudgeLuke @JDFOTH You've heard wrong.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-18 15:01:48	@FudgeLuke @JDFOTH No problem, all the best to you too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-18 00:05:46	@rainedonparade I was a bit worried about Razak on Saturday, kept going for miraculous passes that were miles off. He'll get there.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-18 00:07:38	@rainedonparade Probably not yet, hadn't played for a while.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-18 00:26:23	@JDFOTH @RossingtonMain Bless 'em.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-18 00:42:22	@JDFOTH @RossingtonMain They weren't great, but I've certainly seen worse this season.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 00:30:18	Gone through 5 streams in 30 minutes for Corinthians v Sao Paulo, all going down like dominoes. Think I'll give up.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 00:41:59	Wife just back home from a night at her mate's in York. They apparently watched Cool Runnings &amp; ate cheesecake. Disgraceful debauchery.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 09:04:50	Is it pancake day today? Do I have to go to the shop for some shroves?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 10:08:31	The problem with Italian football Arrigo Sacchi, is it's full of racist old match fixers. http://t.co/o0XHsASDxm
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 10:45:53	#DRFC at home tonight but there's also @RossingtonMain v Pontefract Collieries at 745. Ponte can go top of NCEL 1 with a win.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 12:50:26	@JoeBillGibbo @mophead_88 What kind of barbarian is he?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-17 15:08:39	EA Sports have a FIFA15 event at #DRFC today. Or if you prefer, just a few hundred yards away in Hyde Park is a real life Grand Theft Auto.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 15:32:40	Short and sweet at the hospital. Staff were too quick for any old dears looking for the slightest excuse to moan.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 15:34:56	Little 'Un of course remembered @sarahrovers when we bumped into her. "That lady rings bells very loud"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 16:49:44	Watch House Lane in Bentley closed both ways between Broughton Ave &amp; the train station after a pedestrian hit by a car. #doncaster
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 17:28:03	@sarahrovers Too fast.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 17:30:28	Fingers crossed for the young lass knocked down outside our house earlier. Pretty sickening. Hopefully she'll be OK.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 17:35:24	We said there'd be an accident when the new shop opened over the road, as the car park opens on the road with no railings. Didn't take long.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 17:56:56	Whatever the collective noun for Policemen is, they're in the pouring rain taking photos of the accident. Not so glamorous in CSI Doncaster.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-18 23:51:00	Madonna won't let @gradowrestling use Like A Prayer for his entrance on TNA? I reckon she must be more of a @NoamDar fan. #SayYesMadonna
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 20:33:28	The girl hit by a car outside our house earlier has died. Absolutely sickened. Only 11 years old poor kid. Everyone did what they could.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 20:42:34	@WillPheesh Thank you.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 20:43:59	@mortalcoil Can't imagine how they feel. She was apparently on the way to visit her Grandma nearby.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 20:51:32	Well I was half watching the football on TV but that's knocked the stuffing out of me. Reckon I'll clock off for the night.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 20:52:55	@tommo_cool Awful. Horrendous thing at that age.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 11:31:50	Hospital visit today. I'm tired, ill &amp; grumpy. Preparing dirty looks &amp; extra snark for people moaning they've waited 30 seconds for a nurse
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 11:40:22	@WestStandBogs John Sullivan was the Only Fools &amp; Horses writer. Maybe they got him out of a suitcase off a bloke on the market.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-20 04:24:19	Sleepless night. Decided to get up and watch the Cricket. Yeah, thanks for that England.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-19 15:18:19	@UncladScamMail @84arussell @GavinSAFC I shall have a read after I've watched it later.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-20 08:49:25	There's sand in the side of the road covering where blood pooled. Photographer taking pictures. Why? No one is printing that.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-20 08:57:35	Flowers already appearing around a lamppost across the street. I imagine it will be quite a pile by the end of the day.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-20 10:54:14	Port Vale v #DRFC in doubt over policing costs. http://t.co/bZaP84nMkv
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-20 08:39:19	Photographer &amp; BBC radio van already outside this morning. Appreciate it's their job &amp; it won't be news tomorrow, but it has a ghoulish feel
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-20 08:41:34	@UncladScamMail It is. Radio woman walking up and down the street with a microphone looks uncomfortable. She seems to be ignored.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-20 08:46:58	@UncladScamMail Worst I saw was when a friend died at 19 &amp; local tv tried filming through the window inside the funeral.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-20 09:04:10	@davesargent It was pretty bad.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-20 09:07:04	@davesargent Definitely. Our kids will be getting extra hugs today
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-20 17:18:29	Constant stream of people outside the last couple of hours, either laying flowers or stopping to look at them. Very sad.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-20 17:33:48	Scottish Parliament table a motion to support @gradowrestling over  #SayYesMadonna . Crazy yet brilliant.    http://t.co/zNeoKoFUrD
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 09:43:20	@thestevetacular I use Beyond Pod which has always been pretty good.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 09:56:07	@tdonst Best wishes. I'm a year on from bladder cancer &amp; though seems daunting for you now, it gets better. Hard work but you'll do it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 12:27:56	@ryanmurrant It's a media pass, it says right there in the middle. Otherwise it would say 'Win A Mixed Grill!'
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 12:49:47	#DRFC Youth draw 3-3 with Scunthorpe. 6 goals, one for each finger on a Scunny fan.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 13:59:20	Teams heading out for Bentley Colliery v Thorne Colliery to the old Match of the Day theme. One linesman is fat &amp; bald. Perfect.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 14:24:29	Mid 1st half, Bentley 0 Thorne 0. Plenty of effort, Bentley close a few times and Thorne hit the bar.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 14:26:49	The ref loves his whistle. Probably has a name for it, Wendy Whistle.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 14:34:15	32' Bentley 1 Thorne 0, ball through to Dan Read, bit of pace beats the defence &amp; finishes well
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 14:49:18	HT Bentley 1 Thorne 0. Not bad, plenty of chances for both teams, but the kind of finishing that has passing seagulls in fear for their life
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 14:57:59	Quiz answers in the back of the programme. No.1 is General Augusto Pinochet. I'm assuming he scored in the 1965 Cup Final.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 15:18:09	60' Bentley 1 Thorne 1, striker left unmarked in the box, easy goal that's been coming. Bentley asleep this half
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 15:31:40	73' Bentley 2 Thorne 1, Chris Scott using his strength to hold off the defender and blast it in.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 15:33:57	77' Bentley 2 Thorne 2, header from a corner.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 15:37:23	Thorne free kick from the edge of the box hits the bar. 10 minutes left, 2-2, lively ending.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 15:41:26	85' Bentley 2 Thorne 3, penalty slotted in after a Thorne winger was hacked down.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 15:51:14	FT Bentley Colliery 2 Thorne Colliery 3
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 16:17:45	These 2pm kick offs throw me. Sat in the house at 415 on a Saturday feels wrong.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 16:46:45	Sounds like the #DRFC score is losing PD a grand a week in those contract talks.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 16:47:54	Been a good run though, back at it next game #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 17:59:09	Often wondered how empty Hampden looks when Queen's Park play. Their game v Berwick on BBC Alba now shows it's very, very empty.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 18:05:10	@davesargent Brilliant. I love that channel on iplayer. Live lower league games &amp; hour long highlights of SPL matches
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 18:14:53	@davesargent Worth a dig through iplayer, live Welsh games and Northern Ireland league highlights on there every week too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 18:37:00	Marketing manager dishing out the injury updates again. Very professional. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 08:12:59	#DRFC away, but plenty of games in #ilovedn .@HCIFC v Bilsthorpe, @BRODSWORTHWAFC v Newark &amp; the big derby @BCollieryfc v @Thornecolliery
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 08:22:33	Back to some sort of normality today hopefully with a walk down to the football.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 08:24:05	@JoeBillGibbo That needs to be on a flag!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 09:01:21	Asked Little 'Un if he's coming to football today.
"Do they sell pop?"
"Yes"
"Crisps?"
"Yes"
"Phwooaar!"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 21:01:21	Premier League player gets kicked, he rolls around screaming. Shab Khan of Worcester City gets kicked, he gives back double. #properfootball
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 21:12:31	@jmsutton How it should be. I miss the days of a centre back clogging an opposing forward in the 1st 5 minutes as a reminder.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 21:46:25	I know Ivellise is the heel, but Angelico does look like he needs a slap.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 22:53:01	Shearer says 5-0 is embarrassing. Gets paid for this. Mind you, he does blink at the same time.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 22:55:58	Was going to the toilet but I can hang on 5 minutes to watch Man U suffer.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 23:13:00	As if Alan Green isn't grumpy enough they sent him to watch Villa v Stoke.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 21:14:31	Don't piss in the wind, don't tug Superman's cape, don't kick Shab Khan.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 21:18:51	@jmsutton I remember a Sunday game where my Dad was on the line. Their winger called him a cunt so I did him.Ref smiled, said "All even now"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 21:41:37	Lucha Underground catch up. Mil Muertes looks like he has a pillow down the back of his tights. His name must be Spanish for Deformed Arse.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 22:05:39	It may be early but I want a Mascarita Sagrada for Christmas.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 22:11:17	I've seen people here complain that Lucha Underground encourages violence towards Women. No word of support for the midgets &amp; transvestites.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 22:22:18	If you haven't seen this week's Lucha Underground, @UncladScamMail gets it spot on in this review.  https://t.co/QW7l4VMJMF
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 22:23:44	The amount of times I must type Lucha on my phone, yet its predictive text offers up Luton.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 22:27:12	@UncladScamMail No problem, good stuff as ever.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 22:28:44	Match of the Day plays the music of a pop star who died during an unusual sex act, then cuts to Robbie Savage...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 22:34:54	Matic is no Shab Khan is he?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 23:01:14	Feel sorry for Man Utd, always annoying when you lose your Ki.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 23:33:34	Arsenal away kit looks like @TadcasterAlbion  
Looking for @AdamAcer1978 singing on the advertising boards
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 23:22:44	Joey Barton will probably insist that wasn't a cheap shot to the nuts, but a recreation of aome performance art he saw in Marseille.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 23:27:43	Huddlestone fell just short of saying Barton's ball punch was banter. I hate football.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-21 23:35:58	Brief mention of the #cpfc Holmesdale End, no mention of the anti Premier money banners. Don't rock the trough, eh #MOTD ?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 08:02:32	@UncladScamMail It's further evidence of one of the Internet's greatest gifts, proving that alot of people are really thick.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 08:05:13	@UncladScamMail I think most people would, but as you say it'll always be a red. More likely to be carded for retaliation than a foul.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 09:34:57	One of those responsible for the Chelsea racist attack in Paris is an ex cop &amp; now human rights campaigner. http://t.co/NFGOzg7Xgs

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 11:46:20	Little 'Un on the Playstation. Asked him what he's doing. "I have to rescue someone and fight crime against scallywags"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 21:17:57	@mcnm1981 It's faces win to show how good they are then the heel beatdown to show they're sore losers.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 21:20:20	Odd that they plug a show from Glasgow then show a match at the MEN. Mind you, the opening Angle promo seemed like an empty arena #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 21:21:07	@mcnm1981 It's been done for years but I agree it always looks weak.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 21:24:11	@UncladScamMail It's like people climbing Ben Nevis in January. Waste of the cost of a funeral.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 21:26:03	Is EC3 so dark because of Tyrus' shadow or the ridiculously shitty production values? #impactuk

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 21:40:30	Madonna didn't give Grado his music. Obviously building to a cage match down the road #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 21:45:21	Drew McIntyre &amp; Grado will be rushing off now to open the bowling against England.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 22:32:53	@UncladScamMail When I pointed out it was a pool ball she shrugged and said "Whatever"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 22:35:00	@UncladScamMail She can't stand Mickie James.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 22:36:52	@UncladScamMail She's a decent wrestler, something about her does bug me a bit though.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 22:41:08	@UncladScamMail Yes and some of her mannerisms too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 22:56:12	@surelycrabtree In the US it's apparently presented as if it's live.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 22:57:58	MVP in his Man Utd gear again. I'm waiting for the indie version, FC United of MVP. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 22:59:27	A few decent bits on #impactuk tonight, but once again it's put together so poorly it's irritating to watch.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 23:01:08	@surelycrabtree Just going on what a couple of podcasts have said recently.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 23:02:30	@surelycrabtree The promos on the ramp looked like they were recorded separately, crowd noise the same. Awful editing too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 23:07:29	@surelycrabtree I appreciate they've probably cut the budget since the move, but I've seen indies on youtube presented better.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 23:14:12	#WWEFastLane later, potentially a good show but if Stardust v Goldust doesn't go for the Dusty Finish I'll be disappointed.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 23:24:36	I think @bbctms is broken, they just said England are 112-0. Must be raining and they're playing an old game.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 23:26:25	@EddieSideburns @bbctms Obviously your South Africans are no match for our Irishmen.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 23:28:00	@EddieSideburns @bbctms But it makes you happy when you win one. We just have losing the next game to look forward to.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 23:32:00	@GilharrenD I was impressed with @YeovilLadiesFC at Doncaster last year. I reckon they're a good outsider in WSL2 this season.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 23:54:22	152-0 England sounds good, but against this bowling it's quite poor. Bell batting so slow I thought I'd paused the TV.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 23:58:19	Good job Moeen Ali. Could be on for plenty more yet. #EngvScot
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 00:00:02	@Doncates There's always Monday to look forward to.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 00:14:26	#WWEFastLane pre show on. These things do make me cringe.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 00:23:42	HHH "We're up against the Oscars tonight Vince"

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 00:27:33	@BunnySuicida Makes a change from all the daft stuff lately.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 00:32:49	Remember when Ric Flair fought Dusty Rhodes over some stolen ring gear? No, neither do I. #WWEFastLane
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 00:35:15	@UncladScamMail The Dudleys had to do something to pay for new glasses for Spike.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 00:47:39	It's good of the network to jump so I can hear Reigns get booed twice #WWEFastLane
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 01:00:12	Very tired but I made it to the start of #WWEFastLane  so I'll give it a crack for a match or two.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-24 08:07:03	@Sofalife All these foreign dogs instead of bringing through the puppies and funding grassroots, it's no good for the national team.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-24 08:13:24	@CArmband @Sofalife All these Carlos Chaseasticks on 10,000 Bonio a week, it's a disgrace.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-24 08:23:35	@CArmband @Sofalife Then it's always the fans stuck paying extortionate vets bills, better to watch some honest dogs down the park.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-24 09:57:03	Can you hear that? That's the sound of the kids back at school. It's beautiful.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 17:19:30	@marcmaron @TheComedyStore Weren't you supposed to wear a scarf?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 17:28:17	@mindofgeekness I always have a stack of new followers if I disappear for a few days, it's when I tweet again that people run away!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 01:09:23	6 man tag should be the Car Pool Lane match #WWEFastLane
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 01:11:28	Ryback looks like a stuffed olive #WWEFastLane
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 01:23:04	So that match is why the network is free this month #WWEFastLane
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 01:26:00	Rollins hasn't run that fast since he remembered he'd left his phone at home #WWEFastLane
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 01:45:11	Bit of a yawn at that one &amp; the ref having a run at Botchamania at the end. #WWEFastLane
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-24 14:20:24	@Sofalife @CArmband Woof! Woof! (Wags tail)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-24 14:22:00	Michael Carberry says the English T20 league needs updating with "some jazzy chicks", which is the most outdated phrase I've heard.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-24 14:24:05	@capitalgull There's one google search with a happy ending.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 20:17:05	Packet of Hob Nobs, multi pack of Monster Munch, huge bag of Bombay Mix. Healthy snacks ready for an evening of professional wrestling.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 20:46:48	The Oscars are tonight, which given the current state of Hollywood films will probably be a remake of a classic 70's Oscars show.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 21:11:15	@mcnm1981 From his gut these days it's probably Terrys Chocolate Orange.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-22 21:12:48	The Wolves as good guys in Glasgow wearing Rangers colours. Good luck with that. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-24 17:28:06	@HaveTilFive After seeing him on an old Starrcade last week I googled to see what he was up to. Much of his wiki is about him being a dick.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-24 17:30:19	Not at #DRFC tonight, but if I close my eyes that Bristol City away kit is still visible from last time.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-24 17:34:27	LUFC still running the contest between most owners or managers in a season.    http://t.co/Yk93f7tkBF
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-24 19:50:02	Usually at a game on Tuesday, tonight I think is only the 2nd Champions League match I've watched this year. Not been missed.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-24 19:56:00	@jc_watkin Not a patch on Broddy in the rain.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 19:00:54	To be fair to JBL he is a bit of an Anglophile with his love of Rugby Union &amp; Football references.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 19:02:16	@CaptComicAddict Very true. Not easy to keep talking for 3 hours but you'd think they'd be better at it by now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 19:05:13	@CaptComicAddict Same can be said for any sports or live tv event, part of the job.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 19:44:47	You have to love close up shots of Cena telling Rusev the next move. #WWEFastLane
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 19:47:27	Hoping Cena asked Rusev what he's doing after the show. 
"Early night, I'm knackered. You?"
"Got to visit sick kids again or some bullshit"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-24 20:54:49	#DRFC 2-0 down. No matter what good run we have, the resumption of normal service gives me a warm feeling of womblike comfort.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 18:59:18	Watching the rest of #WWEFastLane . JBL said "I don't want to offend anyone in merry old England". Didn't think that through did he?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 19:08:21	@CaptComicAddict The trouble with new announce teams is that those coming up are worse. The guy on NXT is a Cole clone.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 19:13:51	@CaptComicAddict I never remember his name, the main commentator, short chubby bloke with the glasses.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 19:55:29	@imquitegood I don't think he'll be posh, probably Scouse.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 19:58:59	Rusev-Cena the 1st match I've enjoyed on this show. Not a Cena fan but he's been good lately. Losing a few helps, releasing his inner jobber
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 20:16:46	Perfect sign placement for Reigns' entrance with "All about that Bryan, No Roman" #WWEFastLane
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 20:23:45	Opening couple of minutes is probably the most I've ever seen Reigns move in a match. Then he quickly touched his groin as if he'd pulled it
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 20:34:33	A Grimsby Town shirt being waved in the first few rows is the best thing on this show. #WWEFastLane
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 20:38:52	@Rich_Colby Writing is the big problem. Wrestling used to be booked by old wrestlers, now it's scripted by reality show writers.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 20:43:14	@Rich_Colby Talent is there but it's terribly watered down for tv. Homogeneous corporate wrestling. Dread what they'll do with the NXT lot
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-23 20:53:41	@Rich_Colby It will pick up again eventually, always does. Just painful to watch while we all wait.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-25 10:33:28	Premier League threat to sue FIFA over Qatar World Cup is not about the game.  Qatar bought FIFA, the FA now want their cut.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-25 15:51:59	@jonesthescribe Pictures of you blowing your own trumpet would probably get a few rt's too.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-25 21:37:16	I'm waiting for the Grado chant during Madonna before Jack Jester comes out with that corkscrew. #BRITAwards

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-26 17:20:45	The Ella Smith fundraiser also hopes to have a memorial of some sort at her school.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-26 18:08:49	@AliceRadley That may be one you have over @TheJimCornette , was he ever booked at the Staples Center?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-26 18:35:34	Liverpool looking lively at Besiktas but could do with a goal before they get caught out.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-26 19:30:57	Had to happen, Liverpool failed to take their chances, always going to come back to bite them
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-27 17:31:30	Shame to hear Leonard Nimoy has died. At least he lived long and prospered.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-27 00:06:51	Just looking what football is on tomorrow. Game of the day is surely in the African Confederations Cup, Dolphin v Vegetarianos. Great names.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-27 00:13:47	Googled Vegetarianos FC, from Equatorial Guinea &amp; founded by a Spanish vegetarian. Rivals are Athletico Semu, who probably eat raw meat.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-25 15:03:54	Talk of Reigns failing a drugs test. If true it explains his inability to string a coherent sentence together.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-25 15:07:35	@UncladScamMail Some apparent insider on reddit said he'd failed but Vince backed him, leading to Lesnar walking. If true it's a mess.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-25 15:19:40	@UncladScamMail Don't know who it was, they're apparently providing proof to the moderators. Meltzer reported something was up too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-25 17:36:08	@DrMuttley Very good.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-25 21:17:36	We've only put the Brits on because a friend of my Wife is round &amp; wanted to watch. Haven't seen it since Jarvis got his arse out.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-25 22:20:44	Even Mick Foley would have thought twice at that bump https://t.co/3nXyQFwisU"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-25 12:10:46	@jonesthescribe @tramlines Not too much of a surprise, they had Public Enemy last year.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-25 12:14:41	@jonesthescribe It's a good line up that, on a par with the offering from Reading/Leeds. Good to see Tramlines properly established now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-25 22:38:03	You know Madonna is too old for this game, falling down stairs while Katy Perry rode round the Superbowl on a giant robot Lion.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-25 22:39:50	@chuckie_css I reckon the dancers were secretly from ICW.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-27 07:09:54	@Redpeter99 The part that makes me laugh is at the end, govt. response to being told they lied is just to repeat the lie.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-27 07:24:54	@BBCLookNorth @inges245 Surely we'll be better replacing them with new trains rather than the government.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-27 17:49:40	Was Spock's shirt blue &amp; black or white &amp; gold?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-27 08:18:20	What's the fuss over this dress? It's clearly a pair of trousers.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-27 09:54:10	Good options for football tomorrow, Shaw Lane v Glossop FA Vase QF, if the pitch doesn't make it, North Ferriby v Bath FA Trophy SF.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-27 09:55:36	Just need to get today out of the way now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-27 18:37:26	@Fydsy @DaralPugh @drfc_official Aye with white hoops! If he's half as good as his Dad he'll do well.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-27 10:42:31	1pm pitch inspection at Shaw Lane today for tomorrow's Vase quarter final with Glossop North End.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-25 15:21:04	@UncladScamMail Lesnar's reason for walking supposedly not wanting drug links before a UFC return. Offered to put over Bryan or Cena instead
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-27 19:52:06	Premier League teams fob off living wage campaigners. Players get Ferrari wages, other staff can't afford the bus.  http://t.co/CNrHDUrejP
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-25 21:14:37	Are they muting Kanye West on the #BRITAwards because of swearing or because he's shit?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-26 17:18:59	It's a week since Ella Smith died in an accident outside our house. Here's a fundraiser to help pay for her funeral  https://t.co/iXS2lYfJUE
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-26 17:30:15	@WestStandBogs Keanu goes to watch Athersley though, just thinks the fanzine has nice pictures.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-26 17:33:25	@Aerowen I haven't seen House of Cards but Parks &amp; Rec is a must watch. Very funny in a subtle, not in your face way with great characters.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-26 17:40:08	@Aerowen It's a good one to pick.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 06:54:46	Up early, my cold seems to have gone, which means a trip to the banks of the Humber for the #FATrophy SF, @northferribyutd v @BathCity_FC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 06:59:46	#DRFC in town today, plus @RossingtonMain v Dronfield Town, @HCIFC v Phoenix, Denaby Main v @bawtry_fc, Denaby Utd v @NewBohemiansFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 07:03:27	Good luck to @TadcasterAlbion today on their #favase trail to Highworth Town. The world needs to hear the TSC sing at Wembley.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 07:22:34	@NickQuantrill I'm pleased the Shaw Lane game was postponed so I could make it to Ferriby. Should be a good day.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 07:37:23	@NickQuantrill Going to try &amp; meet up with @knockernorton1 so may see you. I fancy a Ferriby win, did enough in the 1st leg to show they can
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 07:48:25	It's £1.10 on the train from Bentley to Doncaster, so how come going to Ferriby is £5 more from Bentley than Doncaster?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 08:22:16	@knockernorton1 @NickQuantrill I'll give you a shout when I get there.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 08:40:55	If you're at home today, the @TadcasterAlbion youtube channel has a live stream of their #favase quarter final at Highworth Town from 230pm
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 09:20:41	@knockernorton1 @NickQuantrill Yes, I was going to head up there for an hour. Probably around 1pm.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 09:26:08	@knockernorton1 @NickQuantrill I'll see you there then.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 14:16:07	45 mins to kickoff at North Ferriby and it's heaving already. By 3pm the only view left will be from the top of the Humber Bridge #FATrophy
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 11:25:20	Saturday, Doncaster train station, windblown racegoers holding onto their hats &amp; football fans hiding cans of beer from glaring policemen.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 11:36:48	Several Germans on this train. It had better run on time or we'll never hear the last of it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 18:05:30	On the train back home after a tremendous day at @northferribyutd . 1-1 v Bath City and winning 4-2 on penalties. Wemberlee!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 18:08:06	North Ferriby could have been well ahead without extra time and penalties if not for Jason Mellor in the Bath goal. Some amazing saves.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 18:10:12	Great to finally meet @knockernorton1 &amp; his Dad. Good too to put a face to @NickQuantrill , fine people one and all.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 18:37:33	@knockernorton1 Thanks for a good day, let me know when you're over this way &amp; I'll return the favour. Can't promise Wembley though!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 19:30:31	@NickQuantrill @knockernorton1 Definitely. Maybe at Wembley!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 20:33:57	Penalty shootout at @northferribyutd http://t.co/QnhaWpt2sC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 20:59:46	Met quite a few @BathCity_FC fans today, a really nice bunch. Plenty of singing, flag waving and a bit of fancy dress.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 21:01:37	Well done #DRFC today, not just on the win, but for the Junior Takeover. Fantastic idea, just how football should be.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 21:36:11	So Vince Russo takes website subscriptions from his fans then goes on "hiatus". Hopefully a long, long one.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 21:37:13	I'm just surprised Russo can spell hiatus, it has more letters than bro.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 21:40:48	@UncladScamMail He has. Put out a statement saying his site is done for now, no explanation &amp; was still accepting subscriptions today.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 21:43:36	@UncladScamMail He's a loathsome idiot. Amazed anyone still pays attention to him.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 22:01:18	@switzr1 Very true. He's like a pied piper of the stupid.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 22:05:02	England v Sri Lanka on. Let's see what new depths we can plumb tonight.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 22:07:53	@switzr1 He's just done a few Q&amp;A nights over here. Surprised anyone went.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 22:13:27	@switzr1 I'm off to one with Sabu in April. Might ask if he could sort out Russo.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 22:23:01	Sri Lanka miss a couple of catches. Clearly been told to keep it interesting.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-02-28 22:28:49	@daniel_nice7 I saw a pic of the kid replacing PD, same suit and everything! Looked great.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-01 08:24:16	More Football today, @SLAquaFC v Glossop North End in the #favase quarter final at Worksop. Let's hope the Ducks can match Ferriby yesterday
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-01 08:26:26	Little 'Un is coming too, "Will I have sweets? Pop? A burger? Will I see that big duck?" Yes you will.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-02 18:44:52	@BeerNBodyslams The wrestlers they brought to BGT are local to me &amp; they were pretty much shit on. Cowell would kill wrestling off for TV.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-02 18:48:29	@BeerNBodyslams I wouldn't put it past him, probably looking for his next money spinner.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-02 19:10:40	@jtlovell1979 Being on The One Show is a death of sorts.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-02 19:14:19	When I saw Tom Jones trending I immediately thought he probably met Rolf Harris &amp; Jimmy Savile often.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-02 19:16:33	@jtlovell1979 Oh, he'll be anything but poor.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-02 19:27:10	B teams in the JPT, sneaking them in the back door like unexpected anal from Greg Dyke. http://t.co/s1mVWF79Jv
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-02 19:36:45	The Lee/Dickinson finish at Beyond getting plenty of stick. The male/female aspect doesn't bother me, but that lousy chair shot does.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-02 19:38:59	Hard to tell if Lee didn't put her arm up enough or Dickinson went over it but the chair shot stunk.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-02 20:17:49	@david_conn I forget his name, but the player on the receiving end said the same on Match of the Day that night. Ludicrous.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-02 20:21:31	@DrMuttley Isn't the correct pronunciation "Toff"?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-02 20:51:34	Here's hoping Jon Stewart comes to #WWERaw dressed as Andy Kaufman tonight.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-02 20:58:17	The disappointing thing about seeing pics from @glenglenglen in Mumbai is that I'm in Doncaster with a Bombay Bad Boy flavour Pot Noodle.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-02 22:19:38	@RyanRosenblatt @UncladScamMail Probably says more about the mentality of the player than the Ducks marketing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-03 08:19:53	@davesargent You can turn of rt's from individual accounts.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-03 09:29:59	A shame to hear of the death of Dave Mackay who had a spell as #DRFC manager. Here he is saying hello to another one http://t.co/gCstJ3h5JR
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-01 14:55:23	Grey skies, pouring rain at Worksop for Shaw Lane v Glossop. But Little 'Un has chips, North End fans have drums and there's Football.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-01 19:08:26	Home from the football. 2 good games this weekend, both went to extra time, 1 to penalties. Even I'm a bit footballed out.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-01 19:10:49	Best heckle of the day from Little 'Un, a Glossop player caught a whack in the face, "Aw he bumped his head...and he's fat"

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-02 08:51:34	Was about to walk Little 'Un to school, Wife said "I'll go, it's nice out, then I'll go shopping" 2 minutes after she left, wind &amp; snow. Ha!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-02 09:05:19	BBC are not really getting rid of the licence fee, it's actually an extension of it into a tax. You'll pay with a TV or not.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-04 12:53:12	Have @guardian opinion writers seen anything since 1978? Last week it was comics, now total arse on British Wrestling http://t.co/eCTrioTxR5
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-04 13:00:38	After the comic book and wrestling articles from the @guardian I look forward to one calling for 3pts for a win in football.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-04 13:37:34	@BeerNBodyslams @stuheritage @guardian Excellent stuff, well said.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-04 14:19:55	@mrjafri Much like Avengers. A hero who hasn't been an Avenger by now is a very rare thing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-04 14:30:46	@mrjafri I'd love to see teams return to using the same 5 or 6 characters for months, but while the films are profitable it won't happen.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-03 19:55:17	No live game for me tonight, on Dad duties. #DRFC on t'wireless though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-03 19:55:56	@raefil Apologise later if you win.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-03 20:59:54	@raefil That's what the radio commentary seem to be saying too. No disgrace losing there, I'd certainly be ecstatic with a point.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-03 21:06:49	@raefil Probably our regular problem of a decent final ball and finish rather than over playing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-04 19:18:36	I suppose if it ain't broke don't fix it, but Avengers 2: Same As The First One would be a better title.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-03 21:27:46	Finally a goal for #DRFC ,when it was looking like one of those nights.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-03 21:28:41	And another one. 3 points and relax #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-03 21:40:07	2-2, the day that #DRFC make life easy is the day I stop watching.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-03 21:40:55	@RussWWFC One of my favourite grounds. Even better with the view in the daytime.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-03 21:41:26	@rainedonparade Definitely!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-03 22:04:44	Well done Armthorpe @thewelfare , big 3-1 win over Parkgate. Goes a long way to maintaining their record of never being relegated.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-03 22:06:11	Big shock at the top of the NCEL, Tadcaster losing at home. That final day game v Worksop looks even bigger.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-05 19:50:24	Sasha Banks v Charlotte the highlight of a relatively dull #WWENXT this week. They had holds longer than the average main roster divas match
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-05 20:02:16	Time for the 1st Angels game of the year. Hope @Halopauly has stocked up on air freshener.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-05 20:18:20	@wrestlebox It was, really good as usual. Amazing what happens when you have women who can wrestle rather than just look good.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-05 16:01:29	As it's World Book Day all the kids at school have been dressed as their favourite characters. Every single girl was of course from Frozen.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-05 21:25:12	@Halopauly I like when they keep being described as "former Angels farmhand". I imagine them all growing potatoes and corn for Scioscia.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-05 18:13:38	Great ticket &amp; coach deal for @northferribyutd v Wrexham FA Trophy Final if you're in Yorkshire/N Lincs.  http://t.co/HEOPKCypmG

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-06 20:06:18	Kids asleep, Angels game on and a trip to Tadcaster tomorrow to look forward to. Not a bad Friday night.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-06 20:15:26	Bill DeMott has resigned from WWE. Unless they just hurl abuse at him for giving up, kick him in the nuts and send him straight back to work
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-06 20:18:13	@TheIndyCorner Undoubtedly.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-03 22:13:55	@Jamesbuckley7 No, he left a while ago. Coaching at York I think. His brother is still there though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-03 22:15:48	@RussWWFC Good, look forward to seeing them.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 10:45:52	@TheMrsJonesy @jonesthescribe But remember, with today's hangover he'll feel 10 years older than you. Happy Birthday Mr Jones.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 12:40:29	@Leedslass09 At £1.20 a pint next door to Sam Smiths brewery, my research will be extensive.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 12:42:07	On the Leeds-Tadcaster bus. I can taste the Sam's &amp; hear Chickers singing from here.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 14:07:27	In a pub, The Howden Arms. It's smaller than our house with an oak beamed roof &amp; a coal fire. A bloke just asked if they have Sky Sports...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 14:09:12	If you want bars with Sky/BT Sports, Tadcaster isn't the town for you. If you want proper old pubs with glorious beer, get yourself here.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 14:11:27	Some of the shops in town have shut for the football, most have Tadcaster Albion posters &amp; flags in the window. I think they're excited.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 14:20:35	Landlord just said the pub shuts soon so they can go to watch @TadcasterAlbion . All over Tad they're Tad all over.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 14:41:58	In the ground, they've set up a beer tent behind one goal. Best decision in football since Geoff Hurst started up front in the 1966 final.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 15:30:45	Half an hour gone, Tadcaster 0 Highworth 0, not much between the teams, a couple of chances each. Goals in it but tight. #favase

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-06 10:12:15	Police looking to stop "high risk" Friday night football matches. Drunken fights round town centre pubs still OK though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-06 10:18:03	@UncladScamMail I enjoyed Sunderland telling the Police to piss off when they tried to move one a year or two back.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-04 09:38:10	Good to see the Leafs finally work out how to win last night, take out both your opponent's goalies. Good job!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-06 10:20:47	@UncladScamMail Annoys me when Police try to enforce this stuff on football. Main event with drunken violence in Doncaster is the races.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-06 10:24:04	@UncladScamMail Never extra police except for traffic. Fights at the train station, in the pubs, on the racetrack etc.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-06 10:30:57	UKIP have opened a shop in Doncaster. Next to an Indian takeaway, opposite an Irish pub, Polish supermarket &amp; Turkish restaurant. No irony.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-06 12:07:48	@oli_white15 @vivarovers Clearly a Donny accent, rather than Bristol.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-06 12:11:20	@jkomn156 @gaz8630_drfc Really? Cleverly disguised in a Yorkshire accent?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 17:07:17	Disappointing defeat for Tadcaster Albion, going down 1-0 to Highworth Town. Tad had all the possession 2nd half without worrying the keeper
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 17:11:04	Extra time for @SLAquaFC again at Glossop. Refresh button will be getting some hammer on the way home from Tadcaster. Up the Ducks!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 19:30:38	Home from the football. A shame the NCEL sides were knocked out of the Vase today. Really good run though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 19:34:20	Big crowd at @TadcasterAlbion today but impressed at how organised they were, beer tent etc. An example to others at that level &amp; above.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 19:40:27	@switzr1 It's fresh out of the brewery next door too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 19:48:36	@switzr1 Bar on the work tab I hope.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 20:41:01	Seeing pics of the police response to the pitch invasion at Villa. Big contrast to the 1 at Tadcaster, where 2 officers arrived on pushbikes
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 20:50:30	@Saintbarca A few Highworth fans ran on celebrating, all fine but 1 idiot who caused a scuffle which a few locals were glad to join.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 20:51:17	@jcw_72 Exactly like that, we laughed saying Emmerdale.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 21:23:04	Swindon paper spot on with the bother at the end of today's game. One idiot stirring it &amp; a couple more joined in.  http://t.co/yPygAyif4x
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 21:25:51	Out of a 1300 crowd to have 1 fat, red faced teenager getting giddy isn't bad. Overreaction from some on here including people not there.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 21:30:12	@GrahamSmyth An excellent plan!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-07 21:33:51	@GrahamSmyth I only saw a handful of stewards in the ground and they were around the beer tent. People probably ignored the 1 idiot.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 13:20:54	Watching Hibs v Berwick and a quick trip to the toilet meant I missed 2 goals. A new low. Working on missing 3 goals sometime soon.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 21:52:56	@harlequinskiss I leave a bag of masked midgets under mine.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 21:55:07	@magillaposition @harlequinskiss Plus a guitar to hold all my talcum powder in.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 21:58:32	@iLikeDazzyLea I suppose they need something to put giant WTTV logos on.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 22:09:52	Hair v Hair match. Proper old fashioned stipulation we don't see enough of. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 22:10:42	One day I hope for 2 bald wrestlers in a wig on a pole match. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 22:22:34	If #impactuk traded Josh Matthews for some lights and a sober cameraman, Sunday nights would be so much better.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 22:24:07	@UncladScamMail Geography has never been an American strength.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 20:12:41	Angels - Royals game on and just as they start, everyone runs off the field due to a swarm of bees.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 20:16:11	@HaveTilFive Of course Meryl Streep as Steph and Dwayne Johnson as HHH.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-09 11:42:35	Out of the World Cup with one group match left. If I were an England player, I wouldn't bother coming home.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 22:00:46	@switzr1 That Aces &amp; Eights nonsense lasted decades.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 22:02:13	@switzr1 I only watch because I need a good laugh on a Sunday night.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 22:08:37	@switzr1 There are some very good matches, a few fun characters too. EC3 and Bram actually make me want to watch. Rare these days.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 22:21:23	Matthews says Kong &amp; Kim are fighting all over Manchester. From the ring to the entrance ramp... #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 22:30:07	I hope during tonight's @WrestleTalk_TV there's a giant Bullseye logo across the screen. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 22:33:04	@wrestlebox He's horrific. Constant mistakes, seems not to know what to say &amp; just waffles to avoid any silence.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 22:53:08	@Herring1967 In case anyone asks, I just googled International Hermaphrodite Day. October 26.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-08 22:54:12	@ClintonDavey No, they record afterwards in a studio, which sometimes pops up on screen.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 16:57:09	@rainedonparade @jonesthescribe Fracas is relatively new, having replaced 'bit of a to do' in 1978.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 16:59:21	@TheMrsJonesy @rainedonparade @jonesthescribe Rumpus is only used by those who say dinner rather than tea.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-09 19:22:32	Looks on twitter. Someone well known died. Turns twitter off.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-09 20:09:18	Angels v Reds on, see what the new kid Heaney is like. Good to have a young player instead of paying millions for 40 yr olds with bad knees
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-09 20:10:34	Disappointed in the lack of bees opening tonight's Angels game.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 17:02:39	@rainedonparade @TheMrsJonesy @jonesthescribe Usually I find anything less than a fracas is handbags.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 17:03:50	@rainedonparade @TheMrsJonesy @jonesthescribe Kenneth Williams used to play a character called Sid Rumpo on the radio.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 17:08:20	@rainedonparade @TheMrsJonesy @jonesthescribe It was Round The Horne, Sid Rumpo was a folk singer with innuendo filled nonsense word lyrics.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 17:10:29	Jeremy Clarkson suspended...from a gallows before being drawn and quartered later.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 17:21:30	About to watch last night's #WWERaw, remembered it's 3 hours and clicked delete.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 17:37:58	Uche Ikpeazu heads back to Watford. Coppinger's record safe for a while yet #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 17:46:09	Only £5 a ticket at #DRFC on Saturday as we celebrate the career of Uche 'Bubalovic' Ikpeazu.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-09 21:47:47	I see the Man U v Arsenal referee getting plenty of praise on here. Hopefully inspires more to stop being spineless fanboys.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-09 21:56:39	Women's FA Cup Final at Wembley. About bloody time.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-09 22:53:28	Only spring training I suppose but yet another worrying late innings loss for the Angels. Needs sorting out.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-09 23:43:20	Has a NHL game ever started on time? Faceoff 1130, at 1140 we still have anthems, old player parade, Mounties Ice Display Team...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-09 23:47:55	@switzr1 It's actually really long but no one wants to stand for 12 verses about massacres of the Scots and French.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-09 23:51:13	@switzr1 Doesn't go down well with Scotland and France.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-09 23:56:15	@Lily_McSnarly I'd ask if she knew what this rash was before saying, "Oh, not that sort of Doctor" and taking my buns back.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-09 23:57:53	@switzr1 We only have anthems at internationals &amp; cup finals so the singer has usually already won a tv talent show.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 00:00:27	@switzr1 I keep wondering how you got hold of Matt Hardy's teeth.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 18:46:57	New Daredevil trailer looks good. Hopefully the costume replaces the scarf over the face before the end of the series though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 18:54:31	The new Wigan Athletic chairman has me wondering if they'll be sponsored by Botox next season.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 18:59:06	The new Wigan Athletic chairman has more than a bit of #WWE's Tyler Breeze about him.  http://t.co/7SfL2vZ0ey
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 19:12:31	@HaveTilFive @BunnySuicida @NotoriouslyStef Cornbread isn't a thing in the UK, but Jiffy used to be a brand of condoms.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 19:17:53	@IMcMillan Whenever I asked my Dad who someone I didn't know was, he'd say "It's Icky from Wath".

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 19:42:45	Real Madrid v Schalke on a muted TV with FCUM v Ilkeston on the Internet wireless. Football!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 19:47:13	@jcw_72 Always a good listen, a bit like Cricket commentary where the game is often secondary to them waffling on.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 19:51:23	@jcw_72 They're often the only thing stopping me wanting them to lose every week.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 20:28:35	Asked my Wife if she'd heard how Torquay United were getting on tonight. Not so good from the unladylike tirade which followed.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-09 21:41:24	With Man Utd out of the Cup, the BBC will be stuck for a game to show in the next round.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 20:34:33	@jcw_72 Oh aye, it's the constant stream of trophies that does it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 20:56:00	Nicely done by Benzema but it always annoys me with goals like that that a defender didn't snap him in two before he got a shot off.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 20:59:38	Real v Schalke starting to look like the average England Cricket innings at 3-3.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 21:02:28	Ilkeston leading FCUM 2-1 and Swampy describing it as "a huge upset". Not really is it? It's hardly like when they got gubbed at Frickley.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-10 21:57:25	@Doncasterisokay Isn't a brouhaha when someone spills a cup of tea on You've Been Framed?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 10:22:38	@edinburghpaper @jonesthescribe He'll be feeling a bit stiff after that.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 12:15:59	Having to change some bank details &amp; it seems my "memorable details" are completely unmemorable.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 12:19:21	Hoped to get a ton of stuff done at home today, but now I'll have to go to town. Then I'll bump into someone, there'll be a pub, day gone...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 14:20:38	Quick, easy and helpful at @AskHalifaxBank in town. Always ready to moan at poor service so I should dish out praise where it's due.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 15:56:36	Asked Little 'Un "What did you do at school today?","Letters",he replied, "But they'll be different from when you were at school"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 17:24:50	Tadcaster statement on the alleged assault of a Highworth official on Saturday. No surprise, it didn't happen.  http://t.co/8HJbV65Lao
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 17:28:31	Anyone there on Saturday saw the scrum at the end was nothing more than chest beating from 2 or 3 people. Good that accusations are dropped.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 17:56:39	4 shot at rapper L'il Wayne's house. I'm hoping for Bieber, Kanye and a couple of drummers no one has heard of.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 22:31:50	@Heelbook @LuchaElRey @WWENXT It gets better as it goes along too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 22:34:57	@si_minshall @worksoptownfc He's still got it then!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 22:35:36	@chuckie_css Stay tuned, it's only March.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 22:49:58	I'm sure Wolves v Roode &amp; Aries is great, but the cameraman having glued his finger to the zoom button means we'll never know. #JokersWild3
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 22:57:13	@RobJonesWrites No problem, look forward to reading it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 22:59:19	@RobJonesWrites If you ever run out of milk, you know where to come!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 18:26:12	Looks like Suh has arrived to sign for the Dolphins. Expect him to be suspended within minutes for stamping on Don Shula or something.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 18:50:24	You would hope the Dukinfield evidence today is a step towards eventual charges.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 19:29:04	Will Ferrell to play every position for 10 MLB teams in one day tomorrow in a fundraiser for cancer charities.   http://t.co/6iuaSv00BZ
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 23:14:15	It's a shame an important story is joined on The Guardian front page by more oxygen for that pillock Farage. http://t.co/2PJwoeiN6K
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 23:23:40	@JoeBillGibbo When I was in hospital, the nurses would wait for the bus to park outside to grab some wifi.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 23:29:49	Sheffield Steelers won 11-0 tonight. The first time I watched them they put 16 past Blackburn. Standards are slipping.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 23:31:52	@DanGriffin21 They could learn a lesson from Lucha Underground. Tiny crowd in a tiny venue, yet they're full of life.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 23:35:21	@DanGriffin21 Orlando crowd are in a theme park, they're there to go on rides, not watch wrestling. You don't get chants from tourists.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 23:38:21	@DanGriffin21 I always felt sorry for Jimmy Hart when he was there, stories of him outside with his megaphone dragging in the punters.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 23:47:26	@DanGriffin21 You'd think that would make sense, but always possible they lose money on the UK tours.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 23:51:00	@DanGriffin21 Even WWE lose on house shows, they're more useful to them as publicity.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 23:51:45	@RobJonesWrites @chrisjonty Thank you very much.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 20:11:08	@kev_mcclone Best wishes, hope she's better and back home again soon.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 20:13:41	Angels game on. Commentator mentioned it's 80 degrees. Bastards.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 20:19:27	Zlatan sent off for what could be argued was a 50/50. #CHEPSG
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 20:20:54	I'd send him off for the topknot/ponytail effort anyway.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 20:23:50	@chaskynyrd We signed a player, Curtis Main, with the same haircut in preseason. He soon cut it off.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 20:25:50	Ref had the card out instantly, didn't send Zlatan off due to the Chelsea players surrounding him like a black man on the Paris Metro.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 20:30:20	You can see Costa thinking as he headed into the box, shoot or dive, shoot or dive? Of course he went for dive.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 20:32:28	If I was a ref I'd send them all off for being cheating bastards then sit on the ball with a fag and a cuppa for 90 minutes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 20:43:00	People calling for video to help refs. Nonsense. In stadiums of 50,000 the only people seeing fouls &amp; not seeing dives are the refs.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 20:44:21	Better refereeing is what's needed, not video where some ex pro sits thinking the old "he had a right to go down" crap.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 20:46:37	Also needs FAs to start issuing bans for diving and harassing refs. Players will soon stop when they're missing games.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 20:49:34	@chrisjonty They're supposed to be booked now but refs rarely do. Too busy being matey with the players.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 20:52:17	Usual excuse is the game is so fast these days, refs can't see dives. I can see them and my glasses are thicker than Wayne Rooney.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 21:00:37	@DONNYDIVArl I think players are generally fitter and faster, so are refs. Makes no difference to constantly bad decisions though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 21:08:28	@DONNYDIVArl They only cheat because they get away with it. They started diving in the NBA, league handed out $50k fines. Soon stopped.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-12 00:04:04	They clearly struggle to make up the numbers on these TNA ppv's &amp; decide to give Sonjay Dutt a call. Number probably filed next to Sharkboy
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-12 00:05:06	Not a knock on Sonjay though, always liked watching him and I remember when he had hair.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-12 00:10:32	Dammit. I was only staying up for #WWENXT but forgot the US put their clocks back. Watch it tomorrow I suppose.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-12 00:12:13	@UncladScamMail Yes, but with people tweeting about it 10 minutes ahead will do my head in. Double bill with Lucha Underground tomorrow.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 21:40:48	Tadcaster losing, Worksop winning. Another twist in the NCEL tonight. That league has been tremendous this season.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 21:43:17	With Tadcaster losing, beware if you're driving on the A64 tonight as it's possible some wheels may have fallen off nearby.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 21:45:12	@jcw_72 He played for them again tonight apparently. Spoke to him at the Vase game on Saturday, nice enough bloke.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 21:58:25	@jcw_72 If Shaw Lane win their games in hand, they're in with a great shout. Worksop at Tadcaster on the final day too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 22:01:02	@jcw_72 Certainly be tough, but you never know.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 22:06:21	If the BBC producer had punched Clarkson instead, can you imagine the size of the petition to have him knighted?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 22:08:28	@CArmband Physically grown, yes. Emotionally? Eh, not so much...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 22:09:51	Turned Chelsea v PSG off at 0-0, a wise choice it seemed...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 22:11:10	@CArmband As a Doncaster fan, it's rare that we are involved.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 22:12:20	@CArmband Plus Stoke and Wembley. Keeps you warm on cold nights at Crewe.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 22:18:04	Replaced the Chelsea game with TNA wrestling on Challenge TV. Both involve grown men falling over pretending to be mortally wounded.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 22:24:12	Shaven headed Spud comes out. No spoilers though, eh? #JokersWild3
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-11 22:28:05	TNA piss away the end to their best storyline. Imagine WWE having Rollins come out as Champ on the Smackdown before 'Mania. #JokersWild3
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-12 11:36:56	It's no longer 'the likes of Doncaster Rovers', in The Mirror, #DRFC are now a "soccer outpost" :  http://t.co/unbrZmUxW9
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-12 12:00:56	@DJLazarus I think it means national paper writers think it's non league outside the Premier.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-12 17:00:19	@switzr1 An interview with the Columbus Crew goalkeeper in an English newspaper today, I thought you might like.   http://t.co/66LHrqzhw3
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-12 19:05:48	@switzr1 Always like watching MLS, should be another good season. Hopefully you have a run at winning it this year.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 09:06:54	Need to go to town today. Must avoid giving black eyes to people with red noses.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-12 11:04:48	The big news in that Clarke-Harris article is Steve Evans claiming to have friends. #DRFC #RUFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 09:20:22	My bladder is 1 year old tomorrow. I bet that's a card they don't do in Clintons.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 09:24:10	There's a cancer awareness thing at #DRFC tomorrow. I always enjoy telling the people giving out leaflets 
 "No thanks, I've already had it"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 09:26:41	@nealu_freelance Better than this time last year!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 09:32:01	Speaking of bladder birthdays and cancer awareness, here's a quick read for you. http://t.co/RTCMPaNJaP

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 09:37:05	@markusparkus75 Hursty Gets Shirty
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 09:38:31	@markusparkus75 He will if sees that headline.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 09:49:49	Right, trip to town for various Mother's Day items which my Mum &amp; Wife insist they don't want but will make me suffer if they don't get them
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 09:52:56	As it's Comic Relief day, no doubt the shops will have wacky types in baths of beans. Must buy extra chilli sauce.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-12 20:06:31	Wife out, kids asleep, football on TV and Baseball on the radio. I win.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-12 20:38:10	Will Ferrell about to play 1st base for the Chicago Cubs. Should fit right in, the Cubs have been hilarious for years.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-12 20:45:39	Lukaku could have gone down 3 or 4 times on that run. You see, don't dive, get a goal. Funny how that works.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-12 20:49:28	@raefil I'm always right, as my Wife never tells me!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-12 21:13:34	Will Ferrell replaces Mike Trout in CF for the Angels. That's a sentence you never expect to hear.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-12 21:20:40	Will Ferrell makes a great throw to hold a runner at 2nd. If he can bat then even Mike Trout will be dropped.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 14:14:18	Highlights of Will Ferrell playing for 10 MLB teams last night for charity. Very funny &amp; not the worst player. http://t.co/3E8bDYN91h
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 10:34:23	#DRFC for me today, but there are also home games in town for @RossingtonMain ,@thewelfare and @BCollieryfc
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 12:15:18	Waiting for the train to town, there are 2 Rotherham shirts on my platform &amp; several Leeds on the opposite one. This station needs cleaning.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 13:03:32	At the Keepmoat a bit early, had a ticket grumpily thrown at me by a young staff member who clearly wants to be elsewhere.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 13:04:53	Wifi in the Belle Vue bar appears to have disappeared, making it more difficult for me to moan about no wifi.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 13:06:22	@chaskynyrd Cheeky.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 13:08:11	Ambulances, blue lights flashing, were pulling up at the police station as I walked through town. Someone must have 'fallen down the stairs'
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 13:10:11	@chaskynyrd At 43 I'm not far off! She looked about 18, seemed to be disgusted at someone in the ticket office buying a ticket.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 13:39:52	Had a good chat with a Posh fan sharing a mutual loathing of Steve Evans. I bet even his Mother doesn't love him.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 13:41:08	Always a chance Evans doesn't have a Mother and was actually raised by wolves. Fat, ignorant wolves.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 15:00:58	I can be grumpy at the best of times, but seeing a card saying "Happy Mother's Day to my Daughter" has me despairing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 15:01:57	Also saw a teenager with the Seth Rollins half blonde hair. He needed curb stomping.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 15:04:23	Luckily I'm off to the pub later, sharp tongued for any passing Jeremy Kyle types. Or Jeremy Clarkson types. Or that Pearl Jam song 'Jeremy'
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 15:06:19	@rainedonparade I'm standing outside Clintons with an "The End Is Nigh" sandwich board.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 15:07:46	@rainedonparade @jtlovell1979 Probably a card you can buy for that.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 15:17:49	@markusparkus75 If he is, make sure we have a spare producer for him to punch. Little Plough?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 15:19:20	@jtlovell1979 @rainedonparade I saw it in the paper the other day. It's proximity to pubs &amp; shops of every ethnicity is hilarious.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 15:20:23	@markusparkus75 I shall see you there, Ill be in at 5ish.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 13:56:37	@chaskynyrd Worse, he's Scottish ;)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 13:59:20	Scarlett Johannsen. "@drfc_official: Who do you want to see in today's starting lineup? #DRFC"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 14:08:02	@ChrisDonald92 @drfc_official There's a joke in there but this is a family show.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 14:15:44	@biggazlaw You've done it now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 14:56:08	Good pre match tribute to James Coppinger. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 14:58:03	The Posh mascot is a rabbit waving a carrot. WTF is that all about? #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 15:21:23	15' #DRFC 0 Peterborough 1, nice header from James. We're struggling in defence
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 15:30:37	Big shout for a Rovers penalty. Not for me #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 15:54:08	HT #DRFC 0 Peterborough United 1. After much reflection and in depth analysis I've concluded we're shite.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 15:55:35	Can't pass, can't shoot, can't tackle. We'll win this. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 15:56:41	I hope we kept the receipt for Clarke-Harris. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 15:58:13	@biggazlaw It was shoulder to shoulder and went down too easily. Some refs would have given it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 16:03:59	This time last year I was having a major operation. Happy days...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 16:28:48	No improvement 2nd half, only Wabara having a decent game. Wish I'd bought a restricted view seat. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 15:21:11	@markusparkus75 See you later.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 17:57:40	I never leave games early, but I did today. I'd gone 10 minutes before the end after having had enough after an hour. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 17:59:15	Whole new layers of depth and meaning to words like inept and pitiful were provided today. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 18:01:01	Sums it up when MotM Bywater's main contribution in the 2nd half was to almost drop the ball into his own net #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 18:39:53	Good wins for @RossingtonMain 4-2 v league leaders Emley and for @thewelfare 3-2 v Barton. Spent my money at the wrong game today.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 18:44:24	@switzr1 Not a bad deal, extra beer money.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 16:40:48	Train to town a groaning old rattler with holes in the seats, "Manchester Piccadilly" barely visible through the grime on the front.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 16:42:30	The train had a kid dressed as Batman &amp; the guard a ringer for Terry Pratchett, so not all bad.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 16:45:04	Pub is full, including 2 blokes discussing how people live on their phones these days. 
*puts phone away*
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 17:08:01	"We're not in Bawtry this evening my dear", says the man in tweed to his extensively tanned Wife. #doncasterisgreat
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 17:12:46	@NickQuantrill It's a nice place, but some of the residents can be a bit ten bob millionaire.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 17:15:34	@NickQuantrill It's an ideal setting for a crime novel if you know anyone who does that kind of thing...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 17:29:46	Pub emptied as the last race at Cheltenham flew by on the TV, except 1 bloke jumping up &amp; down shouting "Yes!Yes!Yes!" Daniel Bryan fan?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 17:45:56	@Ian_M1 I'm having just the one. It's my second one...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 19:09:53	There's a new indie/rock night in Doncaster tonight called The Pit. 30 years after all the pits shut. What goes around comes around.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 19:12:17	A bunch of #pufc fans in Donny tonight ahead of the game tomorrow. Have a good weekend here, just remember to leave us 3 points #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 19:40:44	@PoshSar Can't have 'em, sorry :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 19:41:30	@ian601 Ha! Very good :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 19:42:15	@PoshSar We're dragged up round here!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 18:31:14	Sister decided Pastures Lodge for Mothers Day was a good idea. But people once thought Betamax &amp; the Sinclair C5 were good ideas too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 20:02:40	@PoshSar He's on loan to us from Rotherham and played a few there this year. Spent more time complaining than playing yesterday.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 20:05:00	@PoshSar I quite liked your lot yesterday. Solid at the back and lively going forward. Worst I've seen us for a few years.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 20:16:31	@PoshSar Swindon at home on Tuesday. I'm giving it a miss in favour of a Northern Premier League game up the road.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 20:23:03	@PoshSar It is a terrible league. Only a couple of teams who have looked good against us.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 20:25:08	@PoshSar We ran Bristol ragged in the cup at our place then gave up a soft late equaliser. Chesterfield, Notts County &amp; Posh good at ours.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 20:49:55	Almost #impactuk time. I'd be looking forward to it far more if they hadn't blown the result of the Spud-EC3 hair match on TV already.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 20:52:56	Best wrestling thing today is someone tweeting their kids were upstairs doing @JimmyHavoc chants. Imagined a 5yr old shouting "Die you cunt"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 21:05:21	@iLikeDazzyLea He's a recent champion. Logical to be in the running.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 21:06:55	@iLikeDazzyLea Still champ before Lashley and they were off air for a couple of months.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 21:08:38	@iLikeDazzyLea It's wrestling. Put your feet up and boo EY :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 21:14:12	Is Taz commentating at the same time as Matthews? His bits sound like the random comments on WWE computer games. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 21:16:39	@mcnm1981 Certainly sounds like stand alone comments rather than the usual back and forth.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 21:20:25	@wrestlebox Spud was, yes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 21:24:03	@wrestlebox Amateur hour.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 21:26:50	@wrestlebox Can't wait for WWE to broadcast the Wrestlemania results on Raw tomorrow.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 21:27:35	Is this the same Wolves interview we ignored last week? #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 21:34:34	@switzr1 Haha! I think I've heard of that before.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 21:48:59	Low Ki in that hat looks like Santa is missing an elf #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 22:05:08	Next feud has to be EC3 trying to shave Bram's beard off. Bram wins with a rusty orange Bic. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 22:10:39	"Kiss my boot" says Bram. He can't call Mickie James a boot can he? #impactUK
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 22:16:04	@BeerNBodyslams He's fantastic. Seen him live a couple of times &amp; both stunning matches.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 22:18:32	I like DJZ. I'd love nothing more than someone slapping the shit out of him, which of course is entirely the point.  #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 22:19:23	@BeerNBodyslams Japan would be perfect, especially Dragon Gate.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 22:21:41	@BeerNBodyslams One of the matches I saw him in was against Uhaa. You have to hope he mentioned Ospreay over there.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 22:32:35	Josh Matthews does a fashion podcast, then appears on tv in that getup #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 22:11:50	At The Pit, Doncaster. As beautiful a place to see live music as you'll find.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 22:25:20	Local band Ginger Tom opening up at The Pit. Might be good. Sound man thinks we only want to hear the drummer.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 22:26:49	@jcw_72 Yep, with a Davy Lamp and a Canary.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 22:28:21	Heard the 2nd song. Boy band with guitars. Can we go back to the drummer?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 22:34:01	Sound man is working from a tablet. I am so old.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 22:50:25	Band unlistenable, beer undrinkable. Off home.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 22:44:36	Graphic, violent content warning? It's wrestling, it's 1045pm, how about you violently put your warning somewhere graphic. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 08:53:10	Might go watch a Sunday League game this morning to bleach that crap yesterday from my brain. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 09:05:07	U13 County Cup final on round the corner at 11. Recovery from yesterday sorted.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 09:18:45	@NathanDRFC Hopefully, quite pleased it was on round the corner from me. Don't watch much junior football these days.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 09:21:28	@NathanDRFC It's a good set up there now with the new building. Better than the big metal shipping boxes they used when I was a kid!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 09:42:25	@NathanDRFC Record pop &amp; crisps sales.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-16 18:16:34	Slog of a day of doctors. Evening of feet up with painkillers and football on tv.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-16 18:17:58	@markdonnelly_ Were the Belles season tickets ever sorted out Mark? Never did receive mine.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-16 18:19:38	@markdonnelly_ Thanks very much. No rush, just one of those things I suppose.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-16 18:21:11	Fiorentina v Milan on, the Milan away kit looks wrong. Like Norwich with the brightness turned down.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-16 18:22:22	@markdonnelly_ Not sure yet, Wife working at the moment but could change by Thursday.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-16 18:24:32	@markdonnelly_ Will do, thanks again.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 11:01:27	Cup Final kicked off a few minutes early, missed a goal, 1-0 to Thorncliffe from Sheffield.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 11:33:37	HT Ryecroft 0 Thorncliffe 1, good game, great standard of Football from these kids.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 11:52:34	Ryecroft 0 Thorncliffe 2, penalty. Just under half an hour left.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-16 19:57:05	Sadly, Reading v Bradford looks dead already.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 12:48:37	Finished Ryecroft 0 Thorncliffe 2. Enjoyed that, really good game.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 13:48:00	@fenneth1989 @gizmo151183 @GeekWithoutFear @Pray4Chandler @ShawnDaley @RobdrawRusso @MarcDucrow Aw love you too! Head bumping overdue.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-16 21:51:31	Remember tabloid editors, pitch invasions are not a flashback to the 80's until they're all wearing "Frankie Says Relax" t shirts.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 15:45:23	@mophead_88 You can hear Lamacq talk on the radio whenever you like, but he's never had the chance to listen to you.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-16 08:26:35	@DonnyFreePress Does the RFU Intermediate Cup Final loss to Thanet at Twickenham in 1997 not count as a national final?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-13 23:43:06	Home from The Pit. Next time I'm sending a Canary in first.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 00:02:03	The Pit. A beautiful place, damn shame about the piss for beer and music. http://t.co/Oi2l9B9Z06
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 00:20:43	There are 15000 signatures on a petition to bring back Terry Pratchett. Never stop internet, never stop. https://t.co/AK8UaWtOyz
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-14 00:30:24	Sleep, wake up, go watch The Rovers, buy Dog, come home, kick Dog.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 20:00:14	@PoshSar Interesting. Seems like bank robber would be a better career than footballer for him.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-15 20:10:05	@PoshSar If they were still playing now we wouldn't have scored. They'd have been fishing balls out of the lake next door all day.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 10:49:00	Great to receive a copy of Papercuts &amp; Inkstains #1 from @RobJonesWrites .Straight to the top of the reading pile. http://t.co/DP8wc0HmL2
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 11:10:34	@RobJonesWrites I'm sure I will, it looks great. I'll be reading it later.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 11:57:37	Arseholes on both sides of the row over the Batgirl/Joker cover reminiscent of the ludicrous gamergate.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 11:58:39	Social media is a great way to have your voice heard, but sadly it doesn't teach people there are times when you should just shut up.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 12:59:29	Given the fan &amp; press fixation on formations, good to hear PD say "it's about players not systems". #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 13:00:48	No point going on about diamonds &amp; 433 when players can't complete passes or make tackles as on Saturday. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 13:01:56	Tonight I'm off to Frickley v Halesowen where it's certainly not about systems but how far you can hoof it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 13:05:46	The new #DRFC away shirt shows what happens when you give One Direction fans the vote.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 13:15:59	Saw Rachel Reeves comments on benefits. Look forward to Ed Milliband knocking on my door in the next few weeks.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 16:43:43	Best wishes to Cerebus creator Dave Sim, hospitalised and going under the scalpel.  http://t.co/jCnigxtudL
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 17:05:08	Open night at Little 'Un's school. Ofsted also in, causing delays. Ironic that inspectors of school standards lower school standards.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 17:06:21	Little ' Un doing OK at school though, his knowledge of Avengers and Star Wars is in the top 1%
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 17:37:58	@jcw_72 Haha! I'm sure it will be alright after an evening of free flowing Messi like football.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-18 17:47:45	#DRFC nominated for Community Club of the Year again: https://t.co/zVJco230w7
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-18 19:10:50	@MnNiceFC @JaxArmadaFC Or Jacksonville Pollocks.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 19:06:15	At Frickley Athletic v Halesowen Town. Iyesden Christie in the squad for The Yeltz, formerly of Mansfield, Torquay &amp; others.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 19:08:02	@capitalgull Playing wide or wide across the gut?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 19:15:03	@capitalgull He was always a big lad, almost Akinfenwa-esque.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 19:19:12	@ImAMarvelNerd St.Patty is the patron saint of burgers.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 19:51:28	One off the post for Halesowen after a bungled header back to the keeper. Visitors should be ahead already.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 20:08:16	20' Frickley 0 Halesowen 1, sloppy defence from Athletic. This chip butty isn't bad though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 20:25:45	Frickley have a goal disallowed for offside just after good work from Thompson forced a fine save.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 20:36:33	HT Frickley Athletic 0 Halesowen Town 1, Yeltz well on top. Blues defence struggling against nippy forward Daniels &amp; nous of Christie.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 20:40:24	Good to see #DRFC 1 up at halftime. See, I stay away &amp; we're good. Should save myself 20 quid every week and get us promoted.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 21:11:46	Mid 2nd half and Frickley much improved but still trail 1-0. Certainly not out of it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 21:21:26	78' Frickley 1 Halesowen 1, deserved equaliser from Allott.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 21:40:03	FT Frickley Athletic 1 Halesowen Town 1
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 22:13:27	Hard luck for Frickley not getting all 3 points tonight. Halesowen were hanging on like the last apple on the tree at the end.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 22:21:50	#DRFC lose another. PD says they're "confused and disappointed". Get that on a t shirt &amp; in the club shop.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 22:23:41	Asked my Wife how Torquay got on, she took a shot at me but missed.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-17 22:24:55	Remind me to say "5-1" to her at every opportunity for a few days.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-20 08:48:47	Typical Tories. 2 days after the budget there's a 90% cut in sunlight.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-20 09:38:51	The eclipse had a weird effect on me. I stopped singing and fell asleep in the nearest tree.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-20 10:10:52	Worst sales pitch ever just now. "As a long time customer we have some discounts for you. For an extra £10 per month..." Er...discount?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-20 16:56:59	@markusparkus75 @jonesthescribe No, been ill,in bed most of the day.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-20 16:59:13	@markusparkus75 @jonesthescribe I'll *cough* live.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-27 20:34:22	First half the usual plodding through the mouth breathing teams before the inevitable loss to Portugal in the finals.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-27 21:16:38	Kane beats Lithuania, he'll go on to face Estonia in a casket match at Wrestlemania.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-27 22:30:28	@switzr1 Cheers mate.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 14:45:51	At Askern v CMFL North leaders Clay Cross in the kind of wind where the stand may end up squashing the wicked witch of the east.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 15:10:33	1st minute goal for Clay Cross seems to have woken Askern, might be in for a decent game.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 15:23:20	20' Askern 0 Clay Cross 2, good save from the keeper but the rebound tapped in.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 15:49:50	HT Askern 0 Clay Cross Town 2, not a bad game in the wind. Visitors deserve their lead &amp; should win but Askern have had good chances.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 15:55:59	It's so windy, coffee has just blown out of my cup into my face.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 16:16:21	The wind has somehow gotten stronger and now there's a bit of rain too. Summer clearly on the way.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 16:31:19	Free kick Askern. "He shoved his fat arse in me ref!" shouts the Clay Cross defender. 
"You loved it" replies the fat arsed Askern player.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 16:47:51	86' Askern 1 Clay Cross 2. Mazy run through the box and chipped the keeper.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 16:55:11	FT Askern 1 Clay Cross Town 2
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 17:52:11	@BilsthorpeFC Not unless I missed a goal when I nipped to the loo.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 18:06:32	@BilsthorpeFC Must have been tweeting the 1st goal and missed the 2nd!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 10:03:52	No #DRFC but there's Armthorpe v Maltby, @RossingtonMain v Bottesford, @BRODSWORTHWAFC v Glapwell, Askern v Clay Cross &amp; Thorne v Ollerton
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 10:04:52	Also this evening, @donnybelles take on Yeovil Town at the Keepmoat.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 10:27:47	If you're heading to the @RossingtonMain game today, be aware that the railway crossing is closed for upgrade work &amp; a diversion is in place
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 10:37:04	@susan1878 Hospital ward I was on had a similar setup. Also had a volunteer tea lady who occasionally helped fetch bedpans etc.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 10:40:28	@susan1878 1 of the night shift nurses told me they have regular reviews which always show they're understaffed. Then new staff never appear
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 10:42:48	@susan1878 Oh definitely, but until they work out how to make a profit from morale, it won't change.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 12:30:38	Still pretty sore and a bit rough today but having a crack at the football. Askern v Clay Cross Town &amp; if up to it after, Belles v Yeovil.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 12:32:01	I'd say the fresh air will do me good but if you've ever been to Askern...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 13:27:20	The Mick &amp; Ann West 6 a side Tournament trophy. Not over the top at all. http://t.co/jyRZkOeiO5
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 13:29:55	That trophy is in The Red Lion at Askern. It's 3 feet high and mostly metal. Probably took the whole 6 a side team to lift it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-28 13:31:21	@RudyardKipling7 It's the most outrageous trophy I've seen. Hard to see how huge it is on that photo.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 00:38:49	Need sleep but there's a baby with no clue the clocks go forward shortly.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 00:40:17	People complain at losing an hour of sleep, but with 2 kids under 4 &amp; a pretend bladder, losing an hour is a good night for me.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 12:31:07	#FATrophyFinal on, have to think Wrexham will win but I'll be cheering for @northferribyutd
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 12:35:03	Good to have Michael Oliver refereeing, probably the best around at the moment. #FATrophyFinal
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 12:46:06	@vivarovers Blimey, that takes some doing. They've just scored too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 13:25:39	North Ferriby sticking with the long ball to Denton. It served them well enough to make the final but they'll need a bit more to win.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 14:19:02	Get in there! Come on Ferriby!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 14:42:13	Incredible comeback from Ferriby. Hope they hang on now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 15:06:36	Penalties again for North Ferriby. No worries.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 15:17:52	These penalties are nervy. I bet @knockernorton1 will need more than a new pair of socks.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 15:18:23	Well done @northferribyutd .Fantastic!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 15:41:32	@knockernorton1 Fantastic stuff. Enjoy it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 14:45:16	@jawtonloe Only a couple of years since I saw them let in 7 at Stocksbridge.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 20:48:28	@AliceRadley Who knew lizards were fans of The Bushwhackers?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 21:01:49	6 hours of #WrestleMania . I'm moist.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 21:04:02	@ata_dizdar Wouldn't be surprised if HHH-Sting steals the show, the old timers still do more wrestling than somersaults.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 21:07:13	Never mind Lita being a Hall Of Famer, she was in Doncaster the other week. Some honours are greater than others. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 21:10:29	@jibbajabbasteve She's just my type.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 21:14:58	This $9.99 promo is like one of those cheesy late night ad shows. Saxton will demonstrate a juicer any minute #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 21:18:59	Graves spent loads of time in Doncaster too back in his SJK days. Saw him in Sainsburys once. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 21:27:54	I have no idea who Kid Ink and Skylar Grey are. They sound like racehorses #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 21:29:13	@MattBeaverESPN First hour of the kickoff show is also on youtube. Obviously desperate to sell a couple more subscriptions.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 21:39:05	@DanGriffin21 Machine Gun Kelly? You're just saying words at me now!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 21:41:18	I think @Ligero1 is on the #WrestleMania pre show as he has to rush off to a tag match in Skeggy later.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 21:51:03	Aloe Blacc will be singing "I need a dollar, then another $8.99" #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 21:51:49	You see, I've heard of Aloe Blacc. I'm not that bloody old.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 22:07:49	If this was TNA they'd have found a way to black out the crowd. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 22:09:28	Come on Tyson, buy Nattie a jacket with a zip that works. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 22:18:34	Spotfest opener at SuperkickMania. What time is Lou Thesz on? #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 18:13:43	#WrestleMania day, some say it's wrestling Christmas, except no one believes in Santa anymore.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 19:53:25	Talk of Bray Wyatt with an ankle injury ahead of Wrestlemania. Shouldn't matter considering Undertaker can barely walk these days.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 19:56:10	@ata_dizdar I'm going to watch, but it's the 1st time I remember not caring about a single match.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 19:58:15	#impactuk about to start just before Wrestlemania, surely the Wrestling equivalent of kissing your sister.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 20:01:56	@ata_dizdar At least twitter will offer some entertainment. I'd imagine there'll be at least 1 great match, just hard to see who.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 20:05:47	@jcw_72 WWE live is perfect for a 13 year old, though I remember sitting behind a kid who screamed with fear at the Undertaker.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 20:08:39	Jeff Hardy's drug convictions don't stop him getting into Florida then? I mean oh good, his injury is healed... #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 20:09:13	@jcw_72 Harsh!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 20:26:52	@Scotty_SL I suppose he is a bit of an amateur there.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 20:31:26	Galloway referencing the end of Braveheart is appropriate as just like wrestling, it's still real to him dammit. #impactuk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 20:55:03	The #WrestleMania stage set has a Xbox red ring of death look about it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 22:22:09	@SouthsideWE New Japan by far.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 22:29:35	Battle Royals are always rubbish. Always. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 22:48:35	Hey, let's not give the crowd the biggest cheer for ages by having Mizdow win the bloody thing. Bullshit. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 23:11:15	Barrett from Preston, Stardust from the 5th Dimension. Both just outside Blackpool. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 23:23:59	Either the network keeps jumping or Harper carried Ziggler up that ladder 3 times. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 23:37:21	Rollins has wet hair, probably just out of the shower. Thank God he put his pants on this time. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 23:47:23	Grimsby Town shirt being waved in the first few rows. California is very much like Cleethorpes at this time of year. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 23:53:01	First match I've enjoyed tonight, mainly as it almost had wrestling in it. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-29 23:59:23	Loving Tanahashi's entrance...oh no, sorry, it's Sting. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 00:06:40	HHH only came for Sting's clothes, boots and motorcycle #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 00:10:58	My little Wrestlemaniac has tapped out. http://t.co/N0zAHTZhG2
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 00:19:52	NWO v DX in a zimmer frame match! #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 00:23:22	Just need Flair now to take out Michaels #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 00:26:26	Now that was good fun #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 00:39:23	Everyone watching #WrestleMania now thinks Skylar Grey sounds like a toilet flushing and a kettle boiling.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 00:52:41	For the dipsticks tweeting "Paige is hot", of course she is, it's probably 80 degrees in the middle of that stadium. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 01:05:10	Here comes Rusev, accompanied by Peggy Mitchell. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 01:07:54	Rusev on a tank was impressive, but he's no Boris Yeltsin #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 01:09:40	Cena flies in on a Bald Eagle #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 01:11:24	Is this an entrance or is Cena announcing a run for President? #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 01:22:21	@SouthsideWE Cool idea, silly costume.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 01:28:09	The Grimsby fans near the front are waving a Russian flag. Must work on the Baltic fleet.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 01:35:12	Screwy finish time for the last two matches. Will it actually be Undertaker? Will Rollins cash in? #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 01:44:41	Rock out early to stop the Reigns riot. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 01:48:39	The People's Eyebrows gave disappeared. Rock looks like me after chemo. Except for the muscles and that, obviously.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 01:53:35	Someone check on Dana White #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 02:00:28	I hope this means Steph gives the Bob Orton cast a comeback #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 02:03:55	The only old timer who hasn't turned up tonight is Gazza with a six pack and a bag of chicken. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 02:18:49	76,000 and this crowd is quieter than the away end at Crewe on a Tuesday night. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 02:21:10	@chuckie_css This one is hard to watch at home.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 02:21:53	@WrestlingScribe True, but the volume has noticeably dropped during this match.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 02:23:54	@ata_dizdar Yes, I saw the Court Bauer pics earlier, still a big crowd though. Slow match has quietened them down.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 02:30:05	A bit of a tired match, loved the 'WTF are you doing?' look 'Taker gave Wyatt's upside down crawl. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 02:34:39	Whatever happens in Lesnar v Reigns, Heyman wins. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 02:35:59	Reigns getting in the ring is easy. If he wins, getting out may be tougher #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 02:44:00	Ouch. #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 02:54:02	Reigns is going to Cena this with one Superman punch #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 02:55:28	Who left that razor on the ringpost? #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 02:58:21	Screwy finish time folks #WrestleMania
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 03:01:37	Good stuff. #WrestleMania far better than I expected.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-30 19:55:15	Crappy day, baby poorly, kidney &amp; bladder pain giving me a kicking, noisy workmen ripping up the road outside &amp; it's raining.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-31 18:54:06	Italy v England? Didn't they inflict enough of that on us in Brazil?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-31 19:07:26	I would have been at a game tonight but one team withdrew from the league, probably over a cost less than 1 England player's hotel room.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-31 19:15:21	@jcw_72 It was yes. Pulled out of the Central Midlands League.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-01 18:07:37	Looked at the trending list, #HolbornFire is followed by #AskPatSharp . Are we fingering an 80's DJ for arson then?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-01 18:08:29	Mind you, it wouldn't be the worst thing an old DJ has done over the past couple of years.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-01 18:11:56	@tomsbfc I thought that as I wrote it. Disappointed in myself that I didn't go there.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-01 06:45:16	@vivarovers @MikeSFollows I can't make it on Friday I'm afraid.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-03-31 12:03:14	@KivoLee @BCollieryfc Not sure they've completely packed up, reserves have still been playing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-02 18:52:24	Milliband is my MP. If he walks silently into the debate, flips Cameron the finger, nuts Farage and walks off, he has my vote.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-02 17:07:05	Election debate on TV tonight. In my head the politicians voices will be replaced by the "Wa wa wa waa" from Charie Brown.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-03 14:14:02	Sadly no #DRFC for me tonight, but if you're going take an extra quid and hand it to the nice man selling the new issue 75 of Popular Stand.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-03 21:42:27	Glad I wasn't at #DRFC tonight from the sound of things. PD is right, half the team are stealing a living. Clear out in the summer.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-03 21:44:40	Give some of the kids experience for the rest of the season, stand us in good stead for next year
 #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-03 21:47:51	I'm not for sacking Dickov, he knows and admits we're crap. Give him a summer without previous years nonsense. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-03 21:50:53	People still talking nonsense about vision and tactics. They're irrelevant when professional footballers can't pass a ball. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-03 21:52:04	@ChrisDonald92 He could be Captain Fantactics but with players who can't pass or tackle, it really doesn't matter.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-03 22:02:35	@daniel_nice7 @ChrisDonald92 More upheaval sacking him won't help.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-03 22:05:45	@daniel_nice7 @ChrisDonald92 Too early for Jones except as a caretaker. Can't rely on him to build a team.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-03 22:08:05	@daniel_nice7 @ChrisDonald92 Need new players still, struggle to beat an egg consistently with some of these.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 00:21:55	@julietmeyers A shopping centre in Doncaster.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 09:47:46	As well as the Askern v Bentley derby, there's Thorne v Glapwell in the CMFL &amp; Denaby United v Byron House in the County Senior #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 09:49:42	Byron House sit top of Div2 of the County Senior League with Denaby Utd 4 points back with 2 games in hand. Big game at Old Road from 3pm.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-02 20:26:55	Expecting Seth Rollins to cash in at the end of the #leadersdebate
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 18:51:30	The beer I've been drinking all afternoon, (Stancil American Beauty), has just gone. Don't think I drank the whole barrel.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 18:53:01	I remember the old days when you'd walk round a bar looking for Women rather than a phone signal.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 18:59:30	The music today has been a fundraiser for mental health awareness. Just spoke to a medium. I'm now very aware.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 19:23:47	Good swapping old 1PW stories with Martin Haythorne. Me getting drunk with Sandman &amp; his Wife can't get in the bathroom for AJ Styles.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 19:26:26	Mate's band on next. Mutton Hawks. Named after the long gone Angel pub in Doncaster where ladies of the night had prices on their shoes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 20:47:41	Cracking time at the Cask Corner Mental Health Awareness all dayer. Good music and great to catch up with old friends and meet new ones.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 20:54:10	Good to meet @RossingtonMain fan @gozhawk2006 . Threw me when his Wife, Patricia, came over. Went to school with her &amp; played as kids.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 21:10:02	The bit of Cask Corner, Doncaster @mophead_88 &amp; @JoeBillGibbo missed. On the roof. http://t.co/4pXXvqVyg2
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 21:13:12	@JoeBillGibbo @mophead_88 It's up a ginnel past the toilets.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 13:14:54	In Conisbrough for Denaby United v Byron House in the County Senior League. Also a bit of Denaby reserves v Dunscroft which kicks off first.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 13:17:05	Denaby res v Dunscroft United is a Doncaster Senior League game, Dunscroft based at the old Hatfield Main ground.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 13:48:04	Dunscroft 3-0 up on Denaby res. after 30mins. 2nd goal went through a hole in the net &amp; the 3rd an outrageous shot from near the corner flag
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 13:53:18	There's a dog on the pitch. Doesn't happen enough these days.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 15:05:25	Gone to see a mate's band at an all dayer at Cask Corner &amp; found a real gem playing. Black Fingernail, like Nick Cave made Johnny Cash sad.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 13:57:07	Back to the main pitch as Denaby United v Byron House gets underway.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 14:06:37	10' Denaby United 1 Byron House 0, great cross nodded in at the back post.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 14:43:16	HT Denaby United 1 Byron House 0. Good game, Denaby deserve the lead &amp; could have a couple more but Byron House on top towards the half.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 15:00:56	58' Denaby United 1 Byron House 1, free kick on the edge of the box rifled into the bottom left corner.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 15:05:28	62' Denaby United 2 Byron House 1, lead retaken with an easy finish from a cross.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 15:13:54	70' Denaby United 3 Byron House 1, cross from the right touchline drifts over the keeper, hits the post and in.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 15:17:18	73' Denaby United 4 Byron House 1, another one to wrap up the 3 points, this one a tap in after a break.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 21:15:03	@JoeBillGibbo @mophead_88 I was reminded the other day of "jitty". We missed that one.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 21:52:32	@Halopauly Do they not appreciate some of us sit watching Pujols knees disintegrate at 4am?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 15:33:32	FT Denaby United 4 Byron House 1. Huge win to put Denaby a point behind Byron House at the top of the league with 2 games in hand.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 15:56:56	@gozhawk2006 I'm sat at the table where the camera is, come say hello.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 21:53:59	When people say "That's an hour of my life I won't get back", I missed #impactuk tonight. I'm 2 hours in credit now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 21:56:13	@Halopauly Not when you're watching Baseball it doesn't :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 17:00:37	Blues act on, TJ &amp; The Suitcase. Not bad but don't announce you're from Leeds before singing about crossing the Mississippi.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 17:38:11	I was heading home by now but people surprised I'm still alive keep buying me beer.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 23:15:02	Baseball season underway shortly, Chicago v St.Louis getting it started. Many pundits tipping the Cubs to do well, they never learn do they.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 23:19:11	@BCAFCBH With flying pigs during the 7th inning stretch.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 23:21:40	@BCAFCBH I usually have a soft spot for them and their comedy ineptness. It'll feel wrong if they win.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 23:22:29	@switzr1 Getting a bit dull now, Cards and the Giants should let someone else have a go.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-05 23:27:36	@switzr1 Every cloud has a silver lining.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 20:40:35	Good day at the football today and a fine 2 hour walk back, which considering my health of late was a miracle.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 20:42:25	Might head back to the Dearne Valley on Monday for the Montagu Cup final. 11am at Hampden Road, Mexborough for those in the area.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 20:43:38	Always a good occasion the Montagu Cup final, 1st played in 1896 &amp; even won a few times by Doncaster Rovers.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 20:45:10	@GavG84 Swinton Athletic v Memories, a Mexborough Sunday team.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 20:48:16	@GavG84 Be tough for them against Swinton, they're top of the County Senior this year. Should be a good game.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-04 20:49:06	@GavG84 More civilisation in the Peaks.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-06 12:49:54	Astonishing Montagu Cup Final, Memories beat Swinton Athletic 4-3, winner in the last minute of extra time after being 3-1 down.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-07 23:42:14	Huge cheer from the Marlins fans as they end the 1st inning 7-0 down. Gallows humour starting early this baseball season.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-07 23:52:51	@HEGS_com Hopkins saying she's signed up for euthanasia when she's seriously ill makes me think "Nurse, pass the syringe"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-08 15:33:56	@jonesthescribe I'm getting those too. I have an Aunt in Scarborough who always calls me Andrew, it must be her running Labour's email.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-08 20:15:08	Cubs - Cardinals radio broadcast interrupted for a tornado warning &amp; baseball sized hailstones. Wife disappointed at the lack of sharks.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-08 20:30:03	@chuckie_css Strangely, our permanent wind &amp; rain seems to have disappeared, it's been warm here since Sunday.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-08 20:36:51	@chuckie_css It'll soon be summer and history has a habit of hanging around.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-08 09:13:28	@KivoLee No idea I'm afraid. I hope so, bad that such a large area is going without.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-08 10:11:41	@ChrisHayes1975 @WestStandBogs Just the NCEL teams. @NonLeagueNorth would be the best one
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 08:27:50	@graham_williams I'll be disappointed if it's bad, Daredevil has always been my favourite Marvel character.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 09:01:31	Barrel scraping by the right wing press today. Milliband dates Women before meeting his Wife. Makes a change from PMs kissing up to Murdoch.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 12:39:55	Other pubs should drum up custom from silent film stars. Beer is off? Harold Lloyd. Out of food? Rudolph Valentino.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 12:43:16	@twounfortunates @WAGUpodcast Jack Mackay much hyped at Doncaster but I've never been impressed by him. Liam Mandeville however...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 12:44:46	@nealu_freelance She'll be in Poundland later, the pub it replaced was a haunt of Charles Dickens when the racing was on.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 12:59:00	@switzr1 Just laughed out loud. Only had 1 beer and the place thinks I must be drunk.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 13:02:10	I think summer is almost here. http://t.co/hfFtY7ZY7B
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 13:32:58	Talking about a look round the beer festival and 2 nuns walk by glaring. Surely they're not going too?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 14:18:44	1st time I've been to a beer festival, there seems to be a curious etiquette in getting a drink and no discount for having a beard.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 14:23:42	Bumped into @donnybelles star &amp; England international @suesmith8 outside. Hopefully doing some coaching rather than a pint of Kelham Island
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 15:04:27	@nealu_freelance Ageing Doc Martens I'm afraid.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 15:12:35	I decided to stick with beer I wouldn't normally see, so it's the 5 from Scotland for me. Loch Ness Drumnadrochit is where it's at kids.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 15:20:27	@switzr1 He'll certainly need a strong drink.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 15:22:34	The CAMRA posters showing 150 new breweries opening &amp; thousands of pubs closing has me wondering when there'll be more beer than pubs.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 16:02:20	Of the 5 Scottish beers I tried, 2 have won awards here. Can't argue. Alchemy best overall &amp; Loch Ness best mild. Where do I buy a barrel?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 19:45:18	Black Fingernail playing the Masons? Aye, go on then.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 19:59:50	Mmmm. Unless they appear from the walls, (nice trick), no band in here tonight.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 20:05:47	Ah! They're playing outside. In the dark. Bless 'em.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 20:10:27	Black Fingernail moved to play outside in the dark. Bleak songs about graves. In the dark. Outside. I love this band.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 08:21:12	Latest twitter update going well. Switches between the old and new layout then crashes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 08:25:10	New Daredevil series on Netflix today. Watch it in one go, a bit at a time or find out it's awful &amp; give up during episode 2?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 08:58:02	@BrandonDLee Good to hear. I have things to do today, may squeeze in episode 1 first though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 21:53:54	Daredevil, episode 1. It's Daredevil. The one from the comics. The one I like. Damn good.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 21:56:03	@Dannyrover It's a beautiful thing isn't it?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 22:00:09	@Dannyrover Batfleck who?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 22:01:53	One of the great things with Daredevil is Foggy. He's perfect. He'll have herpes by episode 6.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 22:04:07	@Dannyrover He'll be just fine as Batman. As long as the ridiculous gravel voice from the last few films has gone.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 22:54:30	Off to bed with this from Black Fingernail in my head. Sleep well... https://t.co/yN0tIVVgj3
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 11:20:17	Review of Daredevil says,"realistically he'd be shot in the 1st 30 seconds by a bad guy". Realistically Superman wouldn't fly either, idiot.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 12:38:09	Pint in the Masons. A Woman was set to leave due to a broken coffee machine but stayed when the barman told her Charlie Chaplin stayed here.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 12:41:07	@nealu_freelance It's the first time I've heard that story. Could well be true, or blarney from the Irish barman.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 13:07:03	Last RT. I hope Furry Mascot Entrance is a euphemism.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 13:27:14	Sat in a pub and I can see the building where there's a beer festival. Sloppy work Greenall. http://t.co/pRoFdo5BoO
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 15:07:46	All the beer here is served in half or 1/3 pints. There are 110 to choose from. I'm sure someone will get through them all.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 15:16:45	@switzr1 I'm interviewing quite well.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-10 15:25:14	A good sign at this sort of thing is the large percentage of younger people and especially Women. Real ale isn't all old blokes it seems.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-09 08:20:29	John Buckley gets it right in the Free Press today, give the kids a run out for the last few games at #DRFC  http://t.co/JplZPT9QDW
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-09 08:21:59	PD says he hasn't closed the door on Theo Robinson. I'd change the locks. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-09 08:25:35	Good progressive move by #DRFC linking up with the Asian Sports Foundation. Maybe something similar soon with local East European community?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-09 08:26:55	I've met and spoken with Poles &amp; Lithuanians at #DRFC  games this year. Be good to encourage a few more down to the Keepmoat
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-09 09:45:20	@DailyMirror @jonesthescribe I'm disappointed he hasn't changed his porn name to Private Members Bill.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-11 13:06:39	Barcelona v Real Madrid, Celtic v Rangers, Boca v River Plate all weak imitations of today's derby, @BRODSWORTHWAFC v @BCollieryfc .
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-11 13:59:12	Teams just heading out for Brodsworth v Bentley. Plenty of goals and the odd red card today I reckon.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-11 14:12:52	1st yellow of the game to the Broddy #7 for dissent. More commonly known as being a mouthy little get. Lively start, 0-0
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-11 14:25:12	23' Brodsworth 1 Bentley 0, took it round the keeper one on one to tap in
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-12 17:39:23	27-15 loss at Edinburgh for @Donnymustangs ,no disgrace considering the long trip to a good team &amp; the QB sent off early.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-12 19:11:27	Astros - Rangers game on. Altuve of Houston is so small he looks like a Make A Wish kid allowed to open the batting.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-11 14:29:29	27' Brodsworth 2 Bentley 0, header from a corner, almost saved low down by Teale but it sneaks in off the post.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-11 14:49:03	HT Brodsworth 2 Bentley 0, Broddy on top, Colliery did well for 20 minutes but the 2 quick goals knocked the stuffing out of them.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-11 15:37:01	Several delays for injuries, Bentley keeper now going off. We could still be here next Saturday. Still 2-0.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-11 15:56:36	FT Brodsworth Welfare 2 Bentley Colliery 0.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-11 17:01:32	Enjoyed the  game today but I have no clue how Bentley didn't score in the 2nd half. Must have had 20 shots and deserved a point.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-11 17:03:51	Couple of good young players for Brodsworth, but would be more effective with a better attitude. Constant badgering &amp; abuse of officials.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-11 17:05:25	Considering it's the end of the season, the pitch at Brodsworth is in tremendous condition. Plenty of league clubs would be put to shame.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-13 12:46:51	Watching GB ice hockey losing to Croatia. No Canadians in their team of course, Zagreb being full of people called Murray &amp; Macauley.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-13 12:50:12	Even the Croats with Croatian surnames are given away by first names like Andy and Nathan.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-13 14:18:55	Having turned the Ice Hockey off at 2-0 down with 10 minutes left, I'm taking full credit for Great Britain beating Croatia 3-2.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-13 16:52:37	Brigg &amp; Rainworth have resigned from the NPL1. Seems odd as Brigg were down anyway &amp; Rainworth not far off. Hope they're not going bust.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-13 16:54:06	Presumably both will apply for the NCEL next season.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-12 07:24:08	Good luck to @Donnymustangs opening up the new American Football season away to Edinburgh today.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-12 09:36:23	Put WWE Network on to watch the latest NXT and only the live stream is available, no option for the archive. Where did it go?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-12 09:46:53	Found it. New layout has the archive hidden out of the way. Has any update for any app ever avoided making things considerably worse?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-14 08:13:39	Ist election leaflet arrived, homophobic right wing Christian spew from the Coalition For Marriage about same sex marriage.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-14 08:14:52	Ironic that these Christian fundamentalists are clear evidence of an evolutionary dead end.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-15 13:20:05	The Bradford City fire investigation story is interesting, but the Hillsborough anniversary seems an odd day for it to come out.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-15 13:43:54	The UKIP Manifesto has been released. Police hope to have it back behind bars by the end of the day.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-15 14:18:12	Cleveland Indians pitcher Carlos Carrasco took one straight in the face last night. Ouch.  https://t.co/6JOX8ihLaB
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-15 18:39:56	Next door has a new puppy. It's extremely cute. I give it 6 months before it's shit in our garden &amp; bit one of the kids.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-15 18:45:14	Angels game on, there's an ad for a 14" pizza. Wife wonders if they deliver to Doncaster.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 09:08:48	Picked up my prescription, bagged in wise words from James Coppinger &amp; Tim Ryan of @drfc_official http://t.co/hOJSm2Wlvs
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 09:30:22	Great trailer from the people behind the recent @NCEL groundhop for upcoming highlights.   https://t.co/AkaJAlp4tH
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-15 08:32:52	May 10 at Askern FC is the Ella Smith Cup, a charity football match for the young girl killed in Bentley last month. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-15 08:35:57	Many players already set to appear inc. ex #DRFC Leo Fortune-West, Tim Ryan, Steve Foster, Simon Marples, Andy Watson, &amp; Jon Maxted,
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-15 08:37:11	There's also Danny Schofield and Enoch Showunmi with more set to be announced.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-15 08:45:11	@BigGazLaw He is a bit, but he was at Leeds for a while so might live nearby.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 16:30:03	GB v South Korea hockey has been a good game, GB 2 down &amp; now 2-2 at the end of the 2nd.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 16:36:03	Even people who can't stand NFL or Baseball will happily sit and watch Ice Hockey. So why not more on tv or in the papers?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 17:13:11	@jtlovell1979 Or that reading the Express both causes and cures  cancer, as Princess Diana tells a medium exclusively in the Express.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 17:14:54	@pexastete33 Obviously does to you.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 17:15:52	@jtlovell1979 Except the weather of course.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 17:23:11	GB win 3-2, great performance to come back from 2 down and hang on grimly at the end. Get that gold medal polish ready.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 18:02:15	@danharmon Wait until they start on the letter C.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 18:04:35	Went by Ed Milliband's constituency office today, the sign has disappeared. Probably sold off by Cameron &amp; his new 'Right To Buy' scheme.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 18:06:24	Glen Harris seems alarmed at having his hand stuck in the Everton manager's ear. https://t.co/b8azlwMSd8
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 18:16:43	Cheers for the mention @knockernorton1. I picked a good day. https://t.co/2kZ3PFbo9Q
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 19:24:36	While everyone else is on the #BBCDebate , Cameron is finally taking his chance to run round Parliament naked.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 19:39:56	@Scotty_SL Imagine him streaking over the opposition benches, just as the cleaner walks in...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 19:54:49	Wasn't watching the #BBCDebate but having seen tweets of Farage having a breakdown, I've tuned in to see if he invades Poland by the end.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 19:57:01	Farage would deport all Grandmas
#BBCDebate
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 20:06:41	I used to think Farage was an idiot. It's clear tonight that he's actually mad. #BBCDebate
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 20:13:24	The answer to the deal question is every one of them would sell their Mother to get into power. #BBCDebate
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 20:22:44	@switzr1 That's the one. Mad as a bag of badgers.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 20:34:07	From the finish of the #BBCDebate , it looks like they're definitely going with Milliband v Cameron at Wrestlemania.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 20:37:50	Ollie The Owl has his bum on back to front.  https://t.co/c1lbnQ4Man
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 20:51:48	Phone ping sound. Email from Ed. Always calls me Andrew and asks for money.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 20:53:34	No, Ed doesn't want money, he wants me to back him calling out Eton Dave. Leave it I say, it makes you look the better man.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 16:34:00	Amazes me that Ice Hockey doesn't get more coverage in the UK. Relatively successful national team, good crowds at league games.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 16:40:46	@GameofThrowIns Probably. Hype of Sky would publicise it more. Now, probably no more than a result in the papers, rare mention on BBC sport.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 16:42:50	@Scotty_SL I came close to kicking the tv in during the Olympics.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 16:53:05	@Scotty_SL Annoyed me how they'd show the 2nd period on one channel, followed by the 1st on another, then never show the 3rd.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 16:54:15	@Chris_TOMP @DefendersPod Just went to subscribe &amp; I'm amazed how many DD podcasts there are.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 16:59:12	@DefendersPod @Chris_TOMP I've subscribed to yours and look forward to listening.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 21:08:17	For my non league followers, @SLAquaFC have a new fans page on Instagram , @quackingcrew_  , give them a follow.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 21:22:46	EBW Wrestling show tomorrow night in Rotherham, helping raise money for @WPCancerCharity . Bell time 630pm. http://t.co/iKsTWkITvs
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 22:42:05	@switzr1 Ask if they have WiFi.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 17:09:34	@pexastete33 There was always a possibility of the story being drowned out by or disrepectful of Hillsborough related news.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 17:18:46	@DefendersPod @Chris_TOMP Will do.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 22:31:56	The new Star Wars trailer looks good, but after Harrison Ford put that plane down, I can't see him doing the Kessel Run again.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 22:39:34	@the_itch1980 I've worked in hospital theatres for years. A&amp;E is often thought to stand for Alcohol &amp; English.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 22:58:38	@RudyardKipling7 Spoilers don't bother me. I know how Wizard Of Oz ends but still watch it on TV every Christmas.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 23:06:57	@AliceRadley You're lucky they weren't window cleaners, they enter with an elaborate scheme of tunnels and fake passports.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 23:13:25	@AliceRadley I often think they could write a book on the sights they've seen. A whole chapter now on scaring velvet voiced podcasters.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 23:15:38	@AliceRadley Haha! Keep up the fine work.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 22:46:36	@HEGS_com Reasonable ustream one here.  http://t.co/mivsNTYiAb
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 22:49:51	@RudyardKipling7 Trailers certainly look the part. Always possible the story is still shite though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 22:53:25	@RudyardKipling7 I'm sure I'll watch, but probably not at the cinema.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 22:55:00	Boca Juniors v Palestino on. Good piece from @TheFootballPink @thefon the Chilean side.   http://t.co/bPPxEllM0S
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-16 23:19:46	Boca Juniors on for half an hour and not a single shot of Maradona in the stands. Shoddy camera work obviously.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 13:39:34	@chuckie_css Canada are pretty good. Should be fun too in front of a home crowd.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-18 08:00:31	Football day, with an added splash of Cricket.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-18 08:05:04	Not just #DRFC at home today, there's @BCollieryfc v title challengers Westella, a derby between @BWAFC1912 &amp; Askern plus @HCIFC v Sherwood.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-18 08:06:36	Yorkshire League Cricket gets underway at Town Fields as @DoncasterTownCC take on Yorkshire Academy.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-18 08:08:02	@footballspoon Already promised the Little 'Un a walk down to watch Bentley. Should be a good one at Worksop, great ground too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-18 08:13:54	Just saw the Katie Hopkins bit from The S*n today. How is that not breaking laws? Last time papers printed hatred like that was '30s Germany
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-18 08:16:33	Hopkins' bile is usually dismissed as clickbait, but that today has crossed the line into inciting racial hatred.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-18 08:22:16	@sojomiff Exactly how that whole thing reads.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-18 08:28:48	@sojomiff It's time someone did. She's gone from pantomime villain to neo-Nazi.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-18 08:32:55	@grumpyoldfan99 Hopefully something is done about her soon. That kind of incitement is dangerous.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-18 10:56:53	Couple of hours at the Cricket, Doncaster Town v Yorkshire Academy. Academy full of future stars, Root &amp; Bairstow played in recent seasons.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-18 10:58:05	Yorkshire Academy bat first.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-18 11:16:47	Some good bowling from Donny to start. Yorkshire didn't score until the 3rd over &amp; a wicket down in the 4th. Now 10-1.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-18 12:21:28	2nd wicket down, Yorkshire Academy 70-2 after 23.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 14:03:48	Off through to Rotherham for the Wrestling. Friday night in Rotherham &amp; I'm paying money to see 'pretend' fights?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 14:05:20	1 match is a tag with a "mystery partner". Sabu was in Rotherham on Tuesday, so I have suicidal, genocidal, homicidal fingers crossed.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 14:13:33	Non league followers, go give the fans twitter at Shaw Lane a follow.  https://t.co/uo0ahPPcww
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 15:50:03	@tomsbfc @JimmyHavoc You'll need to wear waders for that one.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 15:52:54	Set off to Rovrum early having no clue where the venue is. Of course it's just yards from the bus stop &amp; I'm here an hour early. Pint.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 16:03:44	Venue is a proper old school working men's club. Landlord with a scowl, pints of Stones and all the clocks stopped in 1972.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 16:29:05	Customer " Ow come t'big rooms shut?"
Barman "Wrestlin' on"
Customer "John f**kin' Cena n that?"
Barman "Well probably not 'im like"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 16:33:52	That customer will love 1 wrestler on tonight, the masked, stars &amp; stripes clad Uncle Slam, billed as "The Star Spangled Man With The Plan"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 16:34:54	Almost guaranteed Uncle Slam is from Barnsley.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 16:56:35	Just spoke to a bloke who's son is wrestling tonight. I asked which one he was. "The big lad" he replied. Really narrowed it down.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 17:01:59	@TheIndyCorner Haha! His son is up against Stixx, so he'll need to be a big lad.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 17:18:59	Good to meet up with Kris Travis, swapping some post cancer tips. He's looking &amp; doing very well, hopefully back in the ring end of the year
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 17:46:07	Opening match, 6 man tag with The Kings Court v Dirtbag Danny Debris &amp; Sudden Impact.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 17:56:25	Comedy opener. 1 of Sudden Impact taken out &amp; replaced by Wolfe, who thinks he's a dog. Easily dismissed by throwing a ball for him.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 17:57:34	Wolfe of course brings the ball back and bitea hia opponents to ahouts of "Bad dog"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 18:06:08	Kings Court win, forcing Dirtbag Danny to kneel before King Dangerous. You had to be here really...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 18:07:52	Uncle Slam in the ring. Bit of a goof.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 18:38:48	Heel manager promos in Rotherham are hard to boo. "This place is like a holding cell for Jeremy Kyle &amp; the DNA results are in soon ladies"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 07:50:16	@chuckie_css A bit, yes. I watch Doncaster Belles, my local team, regularly.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 08:26:19	1st silverware for Doncaster football last night, well done Denaby Main who won the Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire Association Cup v AFC Emley.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 18:40:08	"This building is the cantina scene from Star Wars and you sweetheart, are a Wookie".
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 18:56:59	Hot Blooded Males retain the EBW Tag Team Championship thanks to their manager's suitcase. Bless those heel managers.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 19:11:46	Too much comedy on this show, always needs a bit but it's been every match. Stixx on later, never see him smile.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 19:17:10	One bonus is that during the interval, kids have have had photos with wrestlers in the ring, not one heel has appeared. Hate when they do.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 19:19:30	It's one kid's birthday and they've given him a cake in the ring. It's my sister's birthday today, she's missed a trick there.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 19:26:06	EBW Catch Championship, Iceman Sam Goodison v Joey D, who should smile maybe.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 19:30:10	From the way he looks Joey D should call himself Skinny Von Erich.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 19:37:08	Goodison nicked some chips from a kid in a wheelchair at ringside. The kid wheeled after him. Just when you thought you'd seen it all.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 19:41:52	Iceman Sam Goodison retains via submission. He flaunts the belt in front of the kid in the wheelchair. The kid gives him the finger.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 19:47:10	EBW Heavyweight Championship as Solid John Green defends v Caleb Crow &amp; "Romanian Sniper" Radu Bulat.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 20:05:43	Green retains, pinning Crow. Good match, as was the previous one. Swapped comedy for Wrestling 2nd half. Mark Sanders v Stixx to finish.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 20:37:44	Heading back to sunny Doncaster. Fun show from @EBW_NCWA &amp; great to yak with @RealKrisTravis . EBW back at Queens Social, Sheffield May 2nd.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 21:56:17	Uncle Slam, the Star Spangled Man With The Plan. http://t.co/xHrWvHqMHv
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 21:56:23	A passing kid took a pic of me with @RealKrisTravis tonight. Bit blurry bless her! http://t.co/D3l6ddHcMK
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 22:02:58	@RealKrisTravis She didn't do a bad job! Thanks for the pic &amp; the chat. Good to see you.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 22:04:15	@Thesixler New series planned, CSI Harmontown Special Victims Unit.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-17 12:32:21	@chuckie_css That will be good. Hopefully you get one of the top teams like the US or Germany.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-19 06:53:07	Chicago Cubs fan catches a foul ball last night...in her beer.   http://t.co/m0XXtvoYbz
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-19 18:59:18	Angels game on, they just plugged a giveaway at Tuesday's game of a wooly bobble hat. Just what you need in the southern California summer.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-20 12:10:26	@TomSnee Thanks for that.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-20 12:16:36	@TomSnee @GrahamSmyth As long as it keeps them in existence, it needs to be done. Good luck to them.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-20 17:58:27	Little 'Un had homework to draw things longer than a piece of string. I avoided telling him to draw WWE Raw or a #DRFC match.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-20 18:03:20	@jcw_72 @jacknpeat @vivarovers Clearly a painted one.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-20 18:35:52	The @SouthsideWE show in Sheffield on May 10 now sees the ROH Tag Titles on the line in the Daniels &amp; Kazarian v Hunter Brothers match.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-21 11:22:04	@tomsbfc I'd be relieved.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-21 11:24:57	@tomsbfc I've seen conversations with him in. He's a little odd to say the least.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-20 18:56:30	The FA Youth Bend The Rules Cup Final on TV.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-21 17:26:38	Even when Donny Dog did those pics in the Sunday Sport?  https://t.co/vgKBtxtRYa
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-21 17:58:18	@jtlovell1979 The only way that's news is if a man threw a shop which sells kebabs made from stools.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-21 18:02:33	Extra hope of a #DRFC win tonight at Concrete Cow FC, put a smile on every real football fan's face.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-21 18:03:54	Good luck too to @frickleyafc at Ramsbottom to complete the annual staying up mission.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-21 19:00:30	Quite a racket at FCUM v Stourbridge and I don't just mean Swampy's commentary.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-20 12:24:23	Possibly the greatest match report of all time by @jacknpeat  over at @vivarovers , #DRFC 0 Fleetwood Town 0 https://t.co/gmG2w2vcpT
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-21 20:19:38	FCUM with a hand on the NPL title, 1-0 up, not long to go.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-21 20:37:29	#DRFC 3-0 down. There are nuns who have scored more this season.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-21 21:32:54	Seeing FCUM get the NPL troohy, I'm sure it's a different one. I saw Hucknall win it at Worksop &amp; remember it being much bigger.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-21 21:35:32	Ex Man Utd fans club win NPL Premier, ex Man Utd players club wins NPL 1 North.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-21 21:36:34	@jcw_72 Troohy. 1st time since my bladder operation that I've been short of a p.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-21 07:21:38	Hospital appointment this morning, where I get to listen to old people complain that their appointment should have been over a minute ago.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-22 08:25:35	The goal that won the Northern Premier League last night in front of over 3500. https://t.co/YCnNv1mk3s
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-22 08:32:24	@UwdiKrugg Incredible crowd, even by FC Utd standards. Imagine how many will be at games next season v Stockport.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-22 08:39:22	@UwdiKrugg Ha! It's been a while hasn't it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-23 08:11:21	Excellent 10 minute film from FCUM v Stourbridge the other night. Captures why non league is much more fun.  https://t.co/oSUBuwKgmH

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-23 13:59:29	@frankiesloan @RealKingRegal Not heard Johnny Angel in a while. He was always on a show in Doncaster. His Dad wrestled as Pitman Dave Adams
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-23 14:22:33	#DRFC family day advertises a clown. It's wonderful to see the referee join in the fun like that.  https://t.co/kGYKeoK8RP
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-22 17:06:04	Local paper today warns of an "Arctic Blast" &amp; "Killer Hornets" heading to town. These bands have odd names nowadays.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-23 19:31:20	@RobSummerfield1 Mine is the same, have to ring early for an appointment that day. Apparently cuts down on people not turning up.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-23 19:37:34	@themib  @Alan4L Some nice but unofficial ones on Redbubble  http://t.co/2TbV4kANcj
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-23 19:39:52	@RobSummerfield1 That's poor. My Wife's GP is the worst I've seen. Dr rings you back rather than an appointment.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-23 19:46:55	@RobSummerfield1 Wife was prescribed over the phone, didn't work. Felt worse for a week before finally seeing the doc &amp; right treatment
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-23 19:56:22	@RobSummerfield1 And no matter who wins the election, it's unlikely to get better.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-22 17:55:57	@markusparkus75  You should take a look at my medicine cabinet. That's a snack. Hope you're not too injured.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-22 18:02:58	@markusparkus75 Get well soon.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-22 18:49:17	Heard an interview with Dick Flavin, PA announcer at the Boston Red Sox. Asked how he got the job he replied "The previous guy died"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-23 20:31:12	Just had the Mets game on, 11th win in a row. Makes it all the sweeter when they inevitably crash.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-23 20:41:25	Good result for @donnybelles tonight as Oxford nick a point away to Fran Kirby.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-23 20:58:13	I see @SouthsideWE have brought in Gail Kim to replace Vader at Stevenage on July 18. She looks nothing like him...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-23 21:00:14	@iamjaywalker Very true.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-22 20:44:27	Slightly worried about the warning on the bag of nuts I just ate. "May contain nuts" also implies that it may not.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-24 07:18:43	@Sofalife You know you're old when your teenage nephew is listening to Suede &amp; you tell him you saw them play...before he was born.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-24 11:18:24	Rotherham have 3 points deducted for Steve Evans using an ineligible mascara.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 11:08:26	Sunshine all week, 10 minutes before going to the football, it rains.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 11:38:16	From the full pantone set of colouring among the gaggle of drunk Women on this train, I'm guessing there's a fake tan convention in Leeds.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 12:09:25	Free train ride thanks to the usual skiving ticket collector in board. £1.80 a pint of Sams in the pub. Yorkshire wet dream.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 12:15:20	Here early to watch some Cricket before the football. Rain showers mean it's good they haven't yet knocked down every pub in South Elmsall.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 12:23:36	Coach load of Curzon fans just went by. As they're looking to secure a playoff place it looks set to be a decent crowd today.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 12:24:44	@jcw_72 Aye. Watching them try to persuade an old bloke to go home &amp; change after he's pissed himself.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 12:28:10	@jcw_72 It's grim, but in a good way. Wouldn't fancy it at kicking out time tonight though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 12:32:19	@jcw_72 Surprised any old working men's clubs still exist.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 12:49:40	Sun breaks through long enough for the Cricket to start. Frickley Colliery v Askern. Nice little ground, bar &amp; food in the pavilion.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-26 13:06:55	Drew Galloway v Tommy End, Wolfgang v Grado, Nikki Storm v Kay Lee Ray. How can you miss it? https://t.co/rN2xIwymZ3
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 05:25:27	Kids think a weekend sleep in means jumping in bed with you and watching Adventure Time at 6am.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 05:42:30	#DRFC away, fans get down to Armthorpe @thewelfare or @RossingtonMain for their final home games. Rosso with a family fun day from 1230.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 05:45:02	Big game too at Tickhill Square in the County Senior, Denaby Main v Denaby United, 1st v 3rd. About as 6 pointer as you get. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 06:21:58	Don't forget #DRFC fans, @donnybelles are at home tonight v Aston Villa, KO 630 &amp; 3 points sees them top of the league.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 08:13:25	@BadWilf Looks like Marilyn Manson has a new record out.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 09:03:48	@mophead_88 If the flat cap fits :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 09:38:43	@BCollieryfc @EasingtonUtd It's only 1099 miles.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 10:07:03	Too many games to choose from today, so I've stuck a pin in &amp; I'm off to watch Frickley not get relegated v Curzon Ashton.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 13:29:30	The Big Fella's Bar has alot of big fellas in it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 13:31:43	Famed ex St Mirren manager Sir Alex of Ferguson was just playing snooker on TV. They've cheered the visiting Manc's by switching it over.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 13:49:42	Curzon fans begin a pre match chant of "Blue Army". They're in red today. 90 minutes to sort themselves out.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-26 17:51:20	For the old Wrestling fans, currently listening to Tony Schiavone in his Gwinnett Braves Baseball commentary gig http://t.co/h7p7neosRs
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 14:17:47	Hope the bin enjoys that chip butty more than I did.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 14:23:40	Open goal missed by Frickley. They're playing quite well but can't be missing those. 0-0.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 14:30:57	Red card Curzon for a flying two footer. Handbags to follow.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 14:34:39	32' Frickley 1 Curzon Ashton 0, 30 yard free kick top corner. Price of admission right there.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 14:35:11	@markusparkus75 That takes some doing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 15:00:02	Frickley deserve their lead, much the better team 1st half. You can see Curzon are no mugs though, so a long way to go in this.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 15:01:38	Rosso 5-0 up and I missed out on the bouncy castle. Bugger.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 15:06:17	2nd half underway, 45 minutes for Frickley to hang on &amp; avoid relegation.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 15:14:47	Gavin Allott hobbling. He'll score in a minute then.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 15:18:22	Of course Allott scores, but a free kick given by the referee. Still 1-0.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 15:19:11	I've seen some really good referees this season. This bloke isn't one of them.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 15:36:02	75' Frickley 1 Curzon Ashton 1, header following a cross from the left. Out of nowhere really.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 15:58:15	FT Frickley Athletic 1 Curzon Ashton 1. Good performance from Frickley, deserved to win but a draw is enough to keep them up.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 16:20:56	12-1 @RossingtonMain ? Who got the wicket?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 17:54:16	You're off. Red card at Frickley Athletic v Curzon Ashton. https://t.co/9gfjpxzkP2
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 19:29:09	@GrahamSmyth @TheOnionBag1 @frickleyafc @macca_parkinson @CurzonAshton Very nice.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 20:12:02	Allams pulling out of Ferriby? Another reason they should never be allowed near a football club.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 20:14:26	@LiamPMcCausland I wouldn't allow him to build a lego set.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-25 20:23:31	@jcw_72 It seems the family are spitting their dummy out with everything around Hull. Makes you sick.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 09:39:49	@LiamPMcCausland PCW go too far with imports, Rev Pro too. I like a couple as it's a chance to see them live, but not whole cards of them.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 09:43:06	@LiamPMcCausland NGW are good, I like Southside too, always a couple of imports on then top homegrown. Always a top show.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 09:59:57	Some great stuff from ICW in Sheffield last night including a Grado, Kris Travis &amp; Dickie Divers cartwheel contest. Hope they're back soon.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 16:13:43	Football tonight, 630pm kickoff for @BCollieryfc v @BilsthorpeFC. Last of the season for Colliery, visitors looking to win the CMFL North.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 17:52:47	Lively start, both teams had the ball in the net, both given offside.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 11:01:56	Does anyone know if it's legal to put election billboards on telegraph poles? I always thought street furniture was out of bounds.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 11:03:06	No prizes by the way for guessing which party has nailed them up on my street.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 11:11:13	@jonesthescribe Relatively.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 11:15:57	@WPCancerCharity @lynnespantry No idea, but will you be selling Curried Currant buns?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 17:33:48	Teams out, about ready to kick off. Let's see if Bentley can finish with an upset.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 17:57:12	Bentley hit the post. This game will either be 0-0 or 8-8.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 18:01:26	25' Bentley 0 Bilsthorpe 1, header from the spot following a really good spell from Colliery.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 18:13:06	35' Bentley 0 Bilsthorpe 2, scrappy one to double the lead.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 18:17:57	Bilsthorpe with another disallowed for offside. Could be some sort of record.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 18:22:38	HT Bentley 0 Bilsthorpe 2, visitors the better team but Colliery have had their moments. If they can nick the next goal it's not over.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 18:30:23	End of season summed up during half time, watching the sun go down over the Cricket ground across the road.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 11:35:30	@pudp1e I don't buy them, haven't read any that are remotely worthwhile for years. Use the money to try out new indies.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 11:48:54	@pudp1e Manage to fill a few holes in old runs over the next month or 2 with almost nothing to buy from Marvel/DC.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 11:57:48	The Tory small business letter is nothing but a scam. Done the same as an ad to send you a £. Always enough daft enough to make a profit
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 11:59:36	Disappointed with Labour housing plans, does nothing for needed social housing, little difference to status quo.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 12:00:38	As usual with elections, it seems no matter who you vote for, the government gets in.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 18:44:37	Bilsthorpe have it in the net again. You guessed it, offside. That's 4 tonight.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 18:59:40	Still 2-0 &amp; the disallowed goal count is up to 5. I reckon the ref has a bet on 3 goals or under.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 19:01:05	72' Bentley 1 Bilsthorpe 2, deserved goal for Colliery with an overhead kick in the six yard box.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 19:06:36	77' Bentley 1 Bilsthorpe 3, striker slid through the keeper before jumping up to tap it in. Looked a foul to me.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 19:07:57	Bilsthorpe keeper told his centre back he'd have gone mad if that goal had been given against him. Poor decision by the ref.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 19:12:16	84' Bentley 1 Bilsthorpe 4, another scrappy one.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 19:14:27	As the 1st card of the game was dished out the visitors goalie helpfully shouted "You can't call the ref a twat"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 19:15:15	87' Bentley 1 Bilsthorpe 5, long shot hits the bar &amp; the rebound banged in.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 19:22:44	FT Bentley 2 Bilsthorpe 5, last kick of the game a screamer into the top corner from 30 yards. Great way to finish a decent game.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 19:47:27	@PhilDoran21 Not this time.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 19:49:44	@PhilDoran21 Didn't notice who hit the second one but the sort of overhead goal was the lad they call Ozzy
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 20:08:24	Good to meet estimable football fan John McLure who was down from York tonight. Not the furthest traveller though with 2 from Sunderland.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 12:31:46	@DJLazarus That would be the biggest upset since Rovers beat Man City.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 12:39:05	St Mirren captain 'spears' team-mate. He sounds like the brains of the team. http://t.co/EOPtihibMK

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 12:43:17	@cyclingbob1 There are UKIP ones up along the street this morning. 1 just yards from the polling station, which I think is also illegal.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 12:59:22	@cyclingbob1 Ladder at the ready!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 20:10:01	On finding me, Mr McLure said "You don't look like a groundhopper". Must take a carrier bag of programmes &amp; 6 cameras in future.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 20:29:04	@BCollieryfc @liamjscully Thought they played well, looked like getting something at 2-1. Officials not the best.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 20:31:08	Walked into the ground tonight at the same time as the parents of the referee. I never knew they had them.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-28 20:45:00	Congratulations to @SLAquaFC who just wrapped up the NCEL championship with a 3-1 win over Cleethorpes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 14:45:00	Billy Corgan joining TNA creative may not improve storylines but the entrance music will be great.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 14:47:28	Dixie Carter says Corgan makes the product more relevant today, over 20 years since he made a relevant record.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 18:52:11	Kids asleep, snacks &amp; last night's WWE PPV to see me through to bedtime.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 19:06:49	Very progressive of WWE as Harper &amp; Ambrose drive off, head to Vegas, get married...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-27 19:12:03	Pucker up Sheamus #WWEExtremeRules
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-29 10:39:27	Had to restrain myself at the flea market in Doncaster. 1930's football cards, #DRFC programmes from 1972. Could've spent a fortune.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-29 10:43:06	@tomsbfc That's fantastic. My Dad was at that game. I have a 60's one away at Lincoln. Ad in it for Norman Collier appearing that night.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-29 10:45:43	@tomsbfc Can't see us getting 10 any time soon, unless it's in the annual charity cricket match.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-29 11:34:06	Steve Evans said avoiding relegation last night was the greatest moment of his career. I dunno, I'd have had avoiding prison at Boston at #1
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-30 08:44:43	@ferretimp @celticlita15 You should try and visit the Pittsburgh Riverhounds ground Adam, incredible view.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-30 09:36:39	Hull City owner Ehab Allam will only spend ASI money on away fans who change their name to Tiger.  http://t.co/QzmtnX9jGZ
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-30 20:38:28	NFL Draft night, Sky will have Jim White stood outside the Miami Dolphins training ground with a dildo in his ear.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 08:46:01	All the UKIP billboards put up on our street the other day have disappeared. A big 1 on the train station yesterday, gone by evening.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 08:47:29	Now, the kippers have parked up a van with a billboard on the back in the station car park. I bet the whole van is gone by teatime.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 08:57:40	What are the odds on Ravenhill being sent off before the 9th hole? https://t.co/k6fl9eTBYY
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 08:58:49	@graham_williams Happy birthday. It's my Dad's birthday today too, though I imagine he's far older!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 12:22:03	@GrahamSmyth No, they're all local amateurs. Still league fees, officials &amp; travel costs in the thousands.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 15:35:25	@Jamesbuckley7 @drfc_official @SUFCOfficial Max Nicholson, at Rovers early 90s for a year or 2.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 15:44:00	@Jamesbuckley7 @drfc_official @SUFCOfficial I'm old.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 15:48:52	@jonesthescribe @markusparkus75 @jtlovell1979 "Ever a fan of roadkill...", I have visions of him serving Milliband hedgehog for breakfast.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 15:51:38	@markusparkus75 @jonesthescribe @jtlovell1979 Buy it, use it to light a campfire for roadside dining.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-30 08:47:23	@retlivdead Doesn't matter too much in my area, Milliband is the MP. Thousands can not bother voting &amp; Labour still win easily.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-04-30 09:40:55	@LiamPMcCausland That's quite frightening.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 16:02:33	@markusparkus75 @jonesthescribe @jtlovell1979 "What's that laid shattered and bloody in the gutter?"
"Your reputation Martin"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 16:05:30	North Ferriby Utd not to be relegated after all, though the Allams will change their name to the Humber Bridge Toll Booths
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 16:37:49	Wife just nearly knocked herself out picking up the kids toys. How long is it polite to keep laughing for?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 16:40:45	@switzr1 I reckon I can manage that.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-02 08:59:31	With #DRFC  playing tomorrow, just 1 game in town today, Askern v @BilsthorpeFC . Only £3 adults, Bilsthorpe trying to win  the CMFL North.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 08:50:50	The van the kippers are using looks like 1 the local scrap man uses. Rather than nick it, I hope people fill it with broken washing machines
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 12:14:01	@GrahamSmyth 32 at Bentley in the Central Midlands on Tuesday, previous game had 1 paying £3. Ref costs £140
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-01 12:31:28	@GrahamSmyth I'm amazed any survive. Huge contrast with local cricket, many teams afford an overseas player.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-02 18:55:16	2-1 win for Worksop at Tadcaster to finish 2nd in the NCEL today. Not quite the battle at Sandy Lane but still 2 penalties &amp; a busy ref.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-02 18:56:45	Always seems odd to me that a league gives a trophy for coming 2nd, especially when it's not much different to the winners pot.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-02 19:01:13	@odetoweeredbook I'm the opposite, I used to like boxing, couldn't care less about tonight.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-02 19:06:30	@Mustang88Paul I'm at a wrestling show on the Sunday, but I'll be there for the rest of the season.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-02 19:09:59	@Mustang88Paul Good to see. There'll be a few wins before the end of the year.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-03 09:40:35	No Rovers for me today. Can't be bothered paying £24 in pouring rain for bad League 1 football. Even if it is the annual gubbing of Scunny.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-03 09:46:08	I've enjoyed 1 game in League 1 this year, #DRFC v Chesterfield. The thought of going is equal to an impending dental appointment.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-03 09:46:58	@RTR1879 Only thing being crushed at most games this year is my will to live.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-03 09:51:01	A summer of refreshing my enthusiasm will have me queuing for a ticket come August. Once a glutton for punishment...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-03 11:33:11	#DRFC lead with a headed own goal, unsurprising as many from Scunthorpe have 2 heads.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-04 18:05:10	Couple of great wrestling watches/listens today. @realmickfoley 's Cheap Pops a must see &amp; @TheIndyCorner with ECW ref Jim Molineaux superb.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-04 18:50:39	@TheIndyCorner Loved it, thank you. Listened to both episodes in one go, 3 hours flew by.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-03 20:19:39	Angels game on. What on Earth happened to Weaver? 1st two batters hit home runs, 3rd off the wall. He's lost it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-05 16:23:47	A quick look at the Joss Whedon trolls shows they're mostly kids. Does he just move house come trick or treat time?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-06 11:28:15	It seems there's a possibility of a hung parliament. I prefer the old days when they'd all have been beheaded by now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-06 12:03:58	@TheFootballPink If it doesn't dilute the standard, then I'd be happy with monthly.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 02:15:07	@chuckie_css Traditionally quite a bit,  Conservatives are our GOP &amp; Liberals more to the left. They joined to form a coalition last time.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 02:26:26	2nd day in a row awake at 3am and can't get back to sleep. Meh.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 02:52:51	@escobaraloplopp Baby was up at 330 last night, tonight it's just me, he's snoring away.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-06 15:36:29	@chuckie_css That's pretty much right. Just hope the school bully doesn't win again.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 04:32:33	TV van just went by. One side effect of having the potential next Prime Minister's office around the corner. Busy day.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 04:34:49	Plan for the day, take Little 'Un to school, go vote, sit back and watch them argue over who actually won.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 05:20:11	Many experts are predicting today's election will be a draw, replay at Villa Park next Tuesday.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 05:27:31	Never understood the argument that if you don't vote, don't complain. It's those who voted the buggers in that shouldn't moan.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 05:29:14	This time tomorrow we'll either be celebrating the end of the Tories or researching Canadian immigration law.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 07:01:20	@jomillerdonny Make sure no one takes a pic of you eating a bacon sarnie, it never ends well.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-06 11:27:01	Day before an election and it seems the entirety of political discourse has boiled down to which candidate is the messiest eater.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-06 11:50:31	@jomillerdonny I like the sound of count training
"1,2,3,5"
"No no no. Come on everyone, once more from the top"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-06 11:52:03	@jomillerdonny I can imagine it's not the easiest. Best of luck for tomorrow.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 08:38:21	Just voted, waiting for the BBC to report the huge swing to the Monster Raving Loony Party.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 08:40:00	Didn't really vote for the Loonys, but when they're on your ballot paper, the temptation is huge.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 10:24:44	Looking forward to this. https://t.co/77qjgNlggW
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-06 19:46:53	Hartlepool Utd with a curious endorsement of UKIP &amp; Tory candidates, in the town where a monkey mascot was Mayor. http://t.co/7mxBcn23N5
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-06 19:47:52	Here's to Hartlepool getting relegated next season.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-06 19:49:34	@Laurencereade A long history of x in a box related madness then.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 13:36:30	Woman in the local paper complaining she couldn't find the polling station. Perfectly good way to filter out idiots.  http://t.co/jgMdUhgb6h
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 15:56:54	Bit of a shock, Tadcaster Albion haven't renewed the contract of manager Paul Marshall.   http://t.co/3OJxvm2w3i
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 16:00:06	Tadcaster is a good job for someone after their recent success. Wonder if @AdamAcer1978 will be applying.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 17:52:17	Biggest shock of this election so far is that the @DonnyFreePress haven't had pics of Louis Tomlinson outside a polling station.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 15:39:04	A friend of Little Un has been off school for 2 days, hurt on the mini pirate ship in the playground after the kids made him walk the plank.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 15:40:16	Poor lad bust his head open but I haven't stopped laughing since I heard about it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 15:41:55	@markusparkus75 I was worried the blood would attract sharks.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 15:43:33	If that had happened when I was at school the headmaster would have given everyone 50 lashes and withheld their grog ration.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 19:43:28	Plenty of reports of huge queues at polling stations. Good news for Milliband?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-08 04:37:06	Back up in time to see Milliband drive by the remains of Belle Vue. Rest of the country will look the same in 5 years.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-08 04:48:24	The Green bloke behind Cameron looks ready for lamping him.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-08 05:25:37	Cameron's first act of the new parliament will be to change the name of the country to Mordor.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 20:55:52	Channel 4 have an "Alternative Election" results show. Paxman is hardly alternative is he?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 20:57:25	Remember when the C4 alternative would have had Graham Norton presenting the results on ping pong balls fired from a stripper?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 20:59:29	Why did SamCam go and vote dressed as a 1940s midwife?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 21:06:41	If that exit poll is correct, then the entire country can go fuck itself.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 21:21:49	@AliceRadley If they're correct, have you got a spare room?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 21:22:37	@AliceRadley That'll do :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 21:27:33	Rang the Canadian embassy, apparently entry requirements are to name 3 players on the 1984 Toronto Maple Leafs. We're on.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 21:51:07	The exit poll expert on the Beeb basically explaining that his poll is bollocks.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-08 06:07:03	With a ton of medication and more post cancer surgery to come, I may have to get Little Un a chimney sweep job to pay for it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-08 09:47:20	@JoeTeulon Half of it has already been sold off, they now have 5 years to flog the rest.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-08 09:49:16	@peter27afcb If the SNP stood in Yorkshire and the north east, they'd walk it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-08 09:53:07	@JoeTeulon Huge chunks of it are now run by private companies including whole hospitals.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-08 09:55:36	@JoeTeulon Hinchingbrooke is 1 NHS hospital already run by private companies &amp; already a complete mess. http://t.co/leA5hM34ai
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-08 09:58:57	Farage losing is of course wonderful, but seems a bit like a late goal when you're already 6-0 down.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 22:35:53	If the Tories get in again at least it will be an end to foodbanks. They'll replace them with workhouses.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 22:39:34	@RobJonesWrites They'll call it something catchier.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 22:41:57	@RobJonesWrites If the bastards win I despair for my kids and their future. Emigration is a serious option.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 22:42:30	@pudp1e Too right :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 23:27:56	I may have confused some tweets, but it's apparently confirmed that Nick Robinson is a cancer.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 23:29:58	@MnNiceFC @David_5mith @theschief Home of Pontefract cakes and a castle where Henry VIII married one of his wives.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-07 23:37:33	Election so far much like an England test match, Labour 3-0 after nearly 3 hours &amp; I'm off to bed.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 08:01:18	#DRFC over but 3 games in town today, Askern v Welbeck, Thorne v Sherwood &amp; @donnybelles v London at 630 (free entry for Rovers ST holders)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 12:44:47	Rotherham Phoenix CC v Elsecar CC (South Yorkshire Cricket League Div.2)  followed by Phoenix FC v Bilsthorpe... https://t.co/V3QCQqzgCS
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 13:01:51	Watching Cricket before the Football. Huge batsman juat walked out, must be 6'6" with a massive gut. His bat looks like a twig in his hands
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 13:03:10	He isn't wearing a helmet, a rare sight these days. Probably break the ball if it hit him.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 13:18:40	The huge batsman bowled out for 10. Quite an achievement getting the ball round him.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 14:17:49	11' Phoenix 0 Bilsthorpe 2, lofted cross from the right, forward gets his head to it before the keeper.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 14:22:17	16' Phoenix 0 Bilsthorpe 3. This could be higher scoring than the Cricket next door.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 14:41:41	35' Phoenix 0 Bilsthorpe 4, beauty of an own goal.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 14:46:00	40' Phoenix 0 Bilsthorpe 5, tap in after a decent save from the keeper.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 13:19:37	@Saintbarca They just did and took his off stump out.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 13:41:28	Elsecar hit one towards the boundary &amp; the Phoenix wicketkeeper runs and fields it. Er...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 14:03:05	Gone 3pm &amp; the teams just coming out for Phoenix v Bilsthorpe. Visitors can win the CMFL North today.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 14:06:10	One linesman is wearing glasses. Finally taken the advice of every crowd ever.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 14:08:22	2' Phoenix 0 Bilsthorpe 1, penalty smartly put away.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 14:58:17	5-0 Bilsthorpe at halftime. All too easy. Phoenix may be dressed like Barcelona but they're more messy than Messi.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 15:14:00	47' Phoenix 0 Bilsthorpe 6, 2nd half going the same way.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-08 12:46:22	@Mister_Airsign AIR! How are you sir?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-08 12:51:29	@Mister_Airsign We're all miserable, election yesterday and the bad guys won.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-08 13:11:25	@charlielard The only turning purple in Rotherham will be down to Steve Evans' blood pressure.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-08 13:51:19	Plenty surprised at the number of votes UKIP got in solid left wing towns. Sit in a pub for an hour &amp; hear the bigotry. No surprise at all.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-08 13:53:03	Doncaster council election results in soon. Expect the Kippers to get a couple of seats out of the 55.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 15:05:31	There's a golf course fairway behind one goal. Wonder how many golfers have aimed a shot at a corner flag.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 15:10:12	2nd place Westella leading at halftime, CMFL North looks like going to the final day.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 15:56:18	FT Phoenix 0 Bilsthorpe 13. Could have been more.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 15:28:05	61' Phoenix 0 Bilsthorpe 7. Can we get double figures?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 15:35:18	69' Phoenix 0 Bilsthorpe 8, another tap in after a great ball through for a well saved first shot.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 15:36:48	71' Phoenix 0 Bilsthorpe 9, 25 yards screamer.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 15:48:32	81' Phoenix 0 Bilsthorpe 11. Hang on, make it 12 as I tweet this.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-09 15:51:03	84' Phoenix 0 Bilsthorpe 13. Equals the highest score I've ever seen in a senior game when Bentley beat Welbeck a couple of years ago.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 06:09:48	Wrestling today, looking forward to Mark Haskins v Tommy End &amp;  @facdaniels &amp; @FrankieKazarian defending the ROH Tag Team Championship.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 06:14:32	Mind you, whatever happens at the Wrestling this afternoon, I doubt there'll be a beating like the one @BilsthorpeFC dished out yesterday.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 07:03:58	Ella Smith Memorial Cup charity game today at Askern FC, 1pm. Features plenty of current &amp; ex #DRFC #LUFC #HTFC &amp; #BCFC players.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 07:06:35	Excellent raffle prizes at that game inc. signed #DRFC , Wigan Warriors &amp; Castleford Tigers shirts plus VIP tickets for Cas v St Helens.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 08:23:41	Happy Sir Francis Tierney day. #DRFC https://t.co/X6Nk7KVHmr
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 21:19:49	Hope Matt Hardy is coming out to call his brother an idiot. #impactUK
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 21:20:33	@BCAFCBH @derekabsundecks @littlerich007 Are Leigh still going? ;)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 21:58:47	Wonderful to meet @PWNradio tonight at Southside. Spot that voice a mile away. Go give them a listen.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 22:07:27	@FlexBuffington You were in a room next to @carolsmillie1 Flex? Hope you got an autograph.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 23:13:35	@BeerNBodyslams Took a few on my phone but they're not great. Couple of nice videos though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 23:16:26	@BeerNBodyslams How do you want me to send them, email?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 23:19:32	@BeerNBodyslams No problem, I'll sort it in the morning. Some of them will be quite nice with a filter or 2. Hopefully do the job.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 13:52:16	Necking a pint in the Devonshire Cat before the Wrestling. Not been here before, good place if real ale is your thing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 13:54:34	Wrestling shows, much like seeing bands, are good for seeing who is popular by t shirt spotting. Grado is winning in Sheffield so far.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 14:00:04	No hipster obscurities on the shirts so far, nearest is a Fozzy one.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 14:06:27	Kayfabe moment of the day, Tommy End &amp; Tyler Bate getting out of a car with the ref. It's still real to me dammit.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 14:23:43	Southside Wrestling (@ Corporation - @corpsheffield in Sheffield, South Yorkshire) https://t.co/AD3vbzYiDz
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 23:42:20	@chuckie_css @facdaniels @FrankieKazarian Best in the Biz-i-ness apparently. Fantastic tonight.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 15:21:02	Aaaand we're off Dynamite Dunne v Stixx #Southside #RiskyBusiness
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 15:34:35	Stixx beats Done after a powerbomb. Cracking match, hot crowd. #Southside
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 15:37:11	Ryan Smile cuts a promo in the ring, cut off with a chant of "Andy Peters". Brilliant #Southside
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 15:41:30	4 way match, Ryan Smile v BT Gunn v Martin Kirby v He's hot, he's spicy...CURRY MAN!! #Southside
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 15:56:11	Gunn pins Smile for win but Smile is joined by Dunne to beat up BT.#Southside
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 16:01:42	Pete Dunne v Tyler Bate on now. Bate one of the best wrestlers I've seen for years and he's only about 20. #Southside
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 16:13:03	Dunne submits Bates. Excellent match. #Southside
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 16:20:19	Robbie X &amp; El Ligero v Righteous Army (Joseph Conners &amp; The Pledge w/ Kay Lee Ray) #Southside
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 16:37:43	Ligero pins Pledge to chants of "Ole! Ole!" Stunning match. Absolutely fantastic #Southside
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 16:39:38	Interval. Superb show &amp; there's still the ROH Tag Team Championship &amp; a 3 way SWE Women's Championship match. #Southside
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 17:11:32	2nd half starts with the SWE Women's Championship. Kay Lee Ray v Viper v Toni Storm #Southside
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 17:23:35	Kay Lee Ray wins then El Ligero squares up to her in the ring. Righteous Army run in &amp; kick the tamales out of him #Southside
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 17:31:49	Time for the ROH Tag Team Championship. Daniels &amp; Kazarian v The Hunter Brothers #Southside
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 17:55:27	Daniels &amp; Kazarian retain the ROH Tag Team Championship. Wonderful stuff #Southside
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 17:57:02	Final match, Mark Haskins &amp; Tommy End kicking the shit out of each other.  #Southside
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 18:03:17	End with the double foot stomp off the merch table after slamming Haskins into the bar. Fuck.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 18:13:05	Haskins wins. Brutal. Brilliant #Southside
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 18:40:42	@gozhawk2006 Good pub, like it alot.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 20:13:01	Back home. Thank you to @SouthsideWE for a fantastic show tonight. Showing once again why British Wrestling is on top of the world right now
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 20:18:51	TNA Anti-Climax is on at home. Why not.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 20:31:30	Discovered where Wrestlers live tonight, went to the toilet twice, said hello to @RealKrisTravis 1st trip &amp; Haskins in full gear 2nd time.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 20:34:11	Mark Haskins walking out of a cubicle 5 minutes before facing Tommy End isn't too surprising. I'd be shitting myself too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-11 06:43:45	@susan1878 @LabourUK Middle aged white men dressed like that and using words like brand and team. That's what's wrong.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-11 06:45:25	Little ' Un said "Daddy, I want to look more like you. Can you show me how to grow a beard?"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-11 06:49:15	@susan1878 @LabourUK That was the main thing to let them down last week. Didn't stand for anything, didn't make a case against austerity.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-11 06:54:27	@susan1878 @LabourUK Politicians living in their own little bubble, need someone with a bit of real life behind them to be party leader.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-10 21:07:48	As a big Wrestling &amp; Comics fan, @facdaniels &amp; @FrankieKazarian signing a copy of Aw Yeah is momentous. Thanks guys http://t.co/f1uwmiJRIV
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-11 06:56:59	@susan1878 @LabourUK I've always quite liked Andy Burnham but they'll see a Scouser from a council estate as unmarketable.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-11 07:01:25	@susan1878 They'll have to get it right or they can kiss goodbye to the next election too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-11 07:03:14	@susan1878 Canadian winter better than perpetual Tory government.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-12 17:34:43	Just another day in sunny Donny... https://t.co/NSppeWx7Ln
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-12 19:56:08	Congratulations @BilsthorpeFC , a 2-0 win at Sherwood this evening has wrapped up the CMFL North championship.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-12 19:43:03	.@RealKrisTravis for #WWEToughEnough ? No one tougher. https://t.co/kO9eb3zJnt
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-13 15:29:51	@markusparkus75 @jonesthescribe Or leading a dog with a box on its back, containing a small child?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-13 15:41:27	@markusparkus75 @jonesthescribe Not really.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-13 17:11:23	@BeerNBodyslams Great review of a great show. Glad the pics were useful too. Southside posted on facebook they're back Oct 10 with 2 shows.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-14 04:43:30	@AliceRadley Not again? Best wishes Alice.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-14 16:17:18	@footballspoon Makes sense for Shaw Lane, derbies with Stocksbridge &amp; Sheffield.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-14 16:30:16	@footballspoon Always end up with a few odd ones, like Gloucester in the Conference North a couple of years ago.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-15 16:18:20	@Aggerscricket @jimmycarr That depends, do they have a tax office?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-15 17:43:14	Hull City holding their own investigation to Jake Livermore's cocaine use. They'll blame it on the fans and change his name to Jake Tigers.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-16 05:38:39	630 tonight, @donnybelles v Reading at the Keepmoat, even this early in the season a possible title decider. £5 &amp; free for #DRFC ST holders
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-15 07:05:20	Madness at Boca Juniors v River Plate overnight, River players attacked with pepper spray.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-15 07:06:36	That incident perhaps highlights 1 benefit to the gentrification of the Premier League, no player was ever blinded by quinoa.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-15 07:09:25	@Simply_Souvik It's just my luck that last night was the 1st in a while I didn't watch.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-15 09:44:23	Saw #DRFC CEO Gavin Baldwin on his phone outside Savers. Fans will now claim Rovers should show more ambition &amp; buy toiletries from Boots.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-15 09:52:08	@barneyfarmer @jonesthescribe Did they find out he was a Tory all along?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-16 12:14:07	Aston Fournilla.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-15 11:16:12	Eating an apple, which I have never done without first shining one side &amp; spinning it round like I'm about to open the bowling at Headingley
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-15 12:10:26	So, what were they doing before now?  https://t.co/ApcY2BeRkB
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-15 12:32:17	@Scotty_SL  And doughnuts.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-16 16:32:39	Hype around Gerrard's last game is understandable, but looking at Liverpool's history, he wouldn't have got a game from about 1965-1990.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-16 16:37:12	@JulianJJHart Stolen word for word from the catchphrase of ex-WWF Wrestler Bret Hart.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-16 16:48:03	@JulianJJHart @EssOpie Should have gone with "It's a small step for man..." or "I have a dream..." :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-16 18:44:35	54' Doncaster 0 Reading 1, Bruton for the Royals, brutal for the Belles.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-16 18:46:18	Yeovil lead at Everton too. Doncaster sport, keeping it uncomfortable for almost 150 years.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-16 18:54:14	2-0 Reading. Call it a night folks. Don't take chances against a good team playing on the break, you'll usually lose.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-16 19:23:29	FT Doncaster 0 Reading 3, no excuses for Belles, didn't take chances 1st half, didn't turn up 2nd.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-16 19:26:31	Reading quite a physical team but so were last year's champions Sunderland. Sometimes you have to forget the nice stuff &amp; get stuck in.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-16 20:32:47	More football tomorrow, 1030 at @BCollieryfc , Doncaster Sunday Alliance Cup final, Bullcroft Sports v Rossington United.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-18 14:04:50	It seems #DRFC have accidentally released the Dons manager too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-18 11:58:43	No surprises in the released #DRFC players. Good to see a few kids retained &amp; Old Man Jones is probably more for coaching than playing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-18 12:07:57	@rainedonparade Same here, needed a clear out. Look forward to seeing who comes in now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-18 12:45:17	Goodbye Theo Robinson, a player so bad even a Turkish prison would release him. #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-18 12:52:54	@NickQuantrill Anything is an improvement at Scunny.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-18 15:49:43	@vivarovers Spotted, @ReeceWabara looking for his keys at a wife swapping party.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-18 17:01:35	Surely it would be easier for the Belfast Giants to move to Sheffield and change their name to Steelers?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-18 11:11:13	Wabara gone from #DRFC . Blocked more fans on twitter than opposition crosses last season.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-18 12:04:48	@rainedonparade He's been touted for a move since January.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-20 20:04:18	@TomSnee @GrahamSmyth They'll take some beating in that division next year.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-20 20:17:19	@BCAFCBH Donny were so bad last year they're letting fans in free...just charging £25 to get out again.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-20 15:45:12	Asked Little 'Un if he learnt any new words at school. "I know them all" he said. "Even antidisestablishmentarianism?","Especially that one"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-21 05:32:02	@chuckie_css Here you go, the charm of the Italian football president.  http://t.co/pzgoKO3ODo
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-21 06:16:27	@WestStandBogs @bfc_official It's the same at Donny in recent years, ton of local non league clubs yet went to Cleethorpes &amp; Park Avenue.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-20 19:08:59	Copa Italia final on, not watching. A more despicable football nation it's hard to find. More match fixing revelations again today.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-20 19:10:32	Add to that the Women's final called off after the federation president said he "didn't see why they give money to those lesbians"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-20 19:56:50	Hearing Shaw Lane have signed Gavin Allott from Frickley. Blimey.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-21 07:09:39	@WestStandBogs @bfc_official Rovers played at Rossington a couple of years back, 2000 turned up. Makes a huge difference to those clubs.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-20 19:01:47	Read an article on David Letterman retiring tonight, the entire tribute of a CBS exec was " He made us alot of money". Classy.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-20 19:11:33	If FIFA wasn't so corrupt, you'd have to think Italy would have been suspended by now.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-20 19:59:48	@GrahamSmyth Plenty. Surprised at the move, must have been an offer too good to turn down.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-20 20:06:59	@GrahamSmyth @TomSnee Feel sorry for defenders up against a Morris/Allott front pair.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-21 18:20:56	@jcw_72 Have to hope they can find someone to score a couple next season.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-21 18:22:31	Couple of great home pre season games announced for @RossingtonMain , July 14 v Boston United &amp; July 28 v Hull City Academy
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-21 18:23:06	@jcw_72 Not sure he's worth the huge wages at Westfield Lane.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-21 18:25:13	Good luck @donnybelles up at Durham tonight. Back to winning ways hopefully.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-22 10:51:58	Charities really need to stop employing people who leap around in front of you like a children's tv presenter after too many energy drinks.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-22 10:55:22	To the Red Cross chugger in town today, I'm not your "mate" or "dude" &amp; my "cute kid" is in a pushchair I will run you over with.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-22 13:56:46	@jtlovell1979 They have them too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-22 12:18:36	@chuckie_css I'll happily do it for free.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-23 09:59:54	Can we get the Irish to do the voting for everything, everywhere from now on? #MarRef
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-23 10:12:35	A first football free weekend in 10 months. I'll be aimlessly wandering the streets in a zombie like state.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-22 13:52:43	@jtlovell1979 Best way to get a fiver off Tesco prices? Go to Lidl.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-22 13:54:06	@jtlovell1979 I was in Sainsburys earlier. That's my posh bit for the week.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-22 13:56:15	Almost time to pick up Little 'Un from school. Then it's half term, a week of "No. Put that down. Don't eat that. Don't hit your brother"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-23 18:52:13	When your Mother said wear your best underwear in case you're hit by a car? Just watched @TheJimCornette at Starrcade 85. Nice.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-22 15:50:34	@jtlovell1979 @markusparkus75 Confusion will only begin when #Arndalegate trends.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-23 16:53:04	Wife spoke to a couple last night with the stupidest named baby. Harbour. Perhaps the kid will grow up to be a Dock-tor.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-22 15:52:39	@jtlovell1979 @markusparkus75 I noticed that. It's horrendous!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-22 15:54:23	@markusparkus75 @jtlovell1979 I remember it as a kid, with its multi coloured fountain. Always ugly.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-22 15:55:32	@jtlovell1979 @markusparkus75 So you can download music...next to the record shop.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-22 15:59:08	@markusparkus75 @jtlovell1979 Careful now, we only just had Morris Men last week.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-22 17:26:57	The excited screech of our toddler seeing Grandad on skype is the most deafened I've been since I saw Napalm Death in Leeds .
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-24 18:20:39	Great 1st win of the season for @Donnymustangs up at previously unbeaten Gateshead, 18-12.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-25 11:14:03	Very surprised at Clough getting the sack. Strange decision.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-25 11:24:05	@DrMuttley Weird, they were on death's door when he took over. Still think they're a Premier League team I think.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-26 07:39:53	Off to Leeds today, Little 'Un all trained up to boo as we pass Elland Road. Though pointing and laughing may be more appropriate these days
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 17:31:06	@Saintbarca Of course not, the national FA's are just as bad on a smaller scale.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 17:57:40	ROH announced for Destination America? Wonder if TNA will go with a six sided coffin.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 18:00:13	Clearly not accidentally cc'd into the email.  https://t.co/djQvd3c5hC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 18:32:37	Anyone worked out a way to link Steve Evans to the FIFA scandal yet? Surely he took a bung for selling official mascara rights?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 18:39:43	@footballspoon Always a running joke among big wrestling fans like me is that wrestling isn't always necessarily the fake sport.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 18:43:21	@footballspoon Definitely. Money talks, from disciplinary decisions, through refereeing decisions all the way to actual results.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 18:47:59	@footballspoon All just as bad, if on a smaller scale. Brown envelopes, funny handshakes, smoke and mirrors.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-28 08:02:47	Also won the Superbowl, Eurovision Song Contest &amp; the Nobel prize for rewriting history.  https://t.co/WkJfbwUvRy
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-28 08:11:34	Here's a factual this week in history for @lufc .  https://t.co/kavL2gIb4X #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 08:46:34	How long until Sepp Blatter awards the World Cup to a country without an extradition treaty with the US?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 12:08:41	Seems to me little will change at FIFA. Swiss statement has FIFA as complainant. Just clearing out potential opposition to Blatter.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 12:11:43	World Cups will still go to Russia &amp; Qatar, if national FA's are any less corrupt, they'll boycott them.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 12:30:57	Dave Penney arrested for assaulting a Police officer. You can take the man out of Doncaster...  #DRFC  http://t.co/WAyCvyGz2o
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 12:35:51	I'd like to think that as Dave Penney swung for that copper, Mickey Walker was behind him shouting "Leave it Dave, he's not worth it" #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 12:44:37	@Scotty_SL Haven't seen one from last week, though I remember him doing a good one a while ago.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 12:46:54	@Scotty_SL Haha! I'm being a bit dim today! I've seen that one then.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 15:04:19	Perfectly American mixing of sporting metaphors at the US Attorney's FIFA conference, describing the job as "batting clean up"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 15:11:03	US Attorney General finds FIFA corrupt. Coming up next, the FBI discover Wrestling is fixed.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-28 20:39:34	I just earned the 'Apprentice' badge on @untappd! http://t.co/lwOdwLffBk
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-28 20:39:38	I just earned the 'God Save the Queen (Level 5)' badge on @untappd! http://t.co/U7jNqRHTcb
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-27 16:02:22	@WestStandBogs @bfc_official Next step is to go to their houses and shout through the letter box.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-29 14:58:40	Blatter says he will fix FIFA. Shouldn't be too difficult for him having managed to fix elections &amp; half the games in the last World Cup.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-29 15:07:15	Blatter's speech was quite creepy. "I'm here with you", want "to continue with you, stay with you". Like a love letter from Jimmy Saville.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-29 08:23:19	Thanks to @StuHFR for issue 1 of Hopeless Football Romantic. A fine addition to the growing list of independent football writing. Go get one
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-29 15:39:39	When people like Andy Burnham are spouting policies straight out of the Tory handbook, then I think Labour are done.  http://t.co/9Af75gOZQP
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-29 16:27:49	Caught up with the latest NXT. Disappointingly jobberific. Highlight was no inane commentary for the first 15 minutes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-29 16:45:58	Ahead of the FIFA election results, here comes Dimbleby with an exclusive exit poll...the Blatter party have 319 seats.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-29 16:49:51	Looking forward to the Disney version of the #FIFACongress , Ali,Blatter &amp; the 40 Thieves.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-29 17:00:19	Prince Ali goes through to the 2nd round where he'll be away to Plymouth Argyle. #FIFACongress
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-29 17:03:10	The winner of the 2nd round will be hoping for a Premier League team at home #FIFACongress
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-30 07:30:37	The annoying thing with the US involvement with the FIFA shenanigans is the constant pronunciation of Qatar as "Kudder"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-29 19:06:46	Scunthorpe United to be sponsored by Prostate Cancer UK. Appropriate, as Scunny have needed to pull their finger out of their arse for years
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-30 09:58:09	It's true the FA Cup Final isn't as good as it used to be. Nothing with Aston Villa in it ever is.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-31 06:53:29	@jonesthescribe Best of luck. If you pass a shop could you pick up a loaf of bread?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-31 07:02:32	The grandly named Doncaster Cycling Grand Prix in town today, though I can't help thinking they should have called it the Tour de Donny.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-31 07:03:50	Weather not the best for watching a bike race, but there may be a pub or two en route...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-31 07:05:30	Best of luck to @donnybelles at Yeovil today &amp; @Donnymustangs up at Clyde Valley. Wins all round I reckon.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-05-31 07:11:32	@DrMuttley Couple of shop windows may be boarded up in the morning.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-02 21:09:13	Interesting game about to get underway, Cuba v New York Cosmos.   http://t.co/PexW6ScXXS
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-02 11:33:25	Dean Furman linked with a move to Kaizer Chiefs...having already turning down a loan to Arctic Monkeys #DRFC
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-02 11:37:20	#DRFC trying to sign French lower league players with poor records sounds worryingly familiar.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-03 12:33:56	The BBC Belles bit seems slightly exaggerated to me. If liquidation came, local community would have saved the club. Demotion sped it up
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-03 12:36:33	Club does seem better run now, but certainly imperfect, season tickets not being issued etc. Still a small fish in a small pond.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-03 12:43:31	Main effect of the Belles demotion not mentioned in the BBC piece is the introduction &amp; expansion of promotion/relegation over franchising.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-03 12:44:29	It showed a small number of fans organising and kicking up a stink can change things for the better. If only there was more of it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 17:08:24	ROH time. Wonder how much Kushida paid for the rights to Back To The Future?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 17:35:23	@Delaware_Dolfan I quite like the look of Bernie Sanders. He won't win though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 17:37:54	@Delaware_Dolfan Same over here. Winning party got 30% of the vote in the recent election. We all lose.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-02 17:02:49	Watching the latest CMLL with an appearance from Tetsuya Naito. He's up against a mini &amp; an exotico. Won't get that in New Japan.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-02 17:06:19	Blatter going won't make much difference to FIFA. Cut the head off the snake &amp; 7 more appear.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-03 14:43:39	Baseball on the radio, a game at the Altoona Curve, which must be the only stadium in the world with a rollercoaster. http://t.co/BUQ2rXpcnG
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 17:42:50	How long until Steve Corino has one more match, slapping the taste out of BJ Whitmer? #ROH
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 17:54:26	Love the new ads on ROH. "I'm a professional cowboy &amp; I use painless catheters. You don't know until you try 'em" Ironically, pissing myself
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 17:56:52	Plenty of talk this week that TNA can't sell advertising. Clearly, catheters are where the money is.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 19:17:00	What if KO was one of us? Just a stranger on the bus, trying to make his way home.  @BeerNBodyslams on Kevin Owens https://t.co/NFOr0q29cT
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 19:17:24	@BeerNBodyslams Good stuff as always.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-03 15:57:23	@WestStandBogs It's probably taken so long as Mansfield Town will be booked up years in advance.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 21:46:39	So enthusiastic about this week's new comics releases that my main purchase was John Byrne's Next Men #3 &amp; 4 from almost 25 years ago.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 22:00:34	More places to hide evidence... https://t.co/hV3jFv51mn
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 22:31:49	@themib @steveaustinBSR @ImGeeze Being Geeze for the working man.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 22:34:37	I sense Stone Cold muting the phrase Geeze.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 22:36:40	@neillyfabi Or buying Only Fools &amp; Horses box sets.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 22:37:42	@neillyfabi And a suitcase in his SUV.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 22:46:14	Mind you,  that Irvin &amp; Seb 'Geeze' video ended with them saying "Tweet Us". Didn't include their twitter. Geeze = Nice but dim.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-03 17:31:04	@Ligero1 Just wait until they pull your mask off &amp; we discover you were the old caretaker all along.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 22:49:14	@neillyfabi I'm still amazed by these things, yet our 4 year old just said "seen it" the last time it came over. Like a car.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 22:54:54	@BCAFCBH I was at the 1st one in Hamilton. Spent 20 mins nodding &amp; smiling at some bikers from Dunbar who questioned my Bobby Charlton shirt
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 22:57:35	@themib Give him credit, he didn't ring the cops when some hooligans put his window through.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 23:00:16	@DennisCricket_  Australian $? So... about £1.38?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 23:05:33	@spacegirlcurtis Happy Birthday.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 23:14:40	@Nic_Nik I have the LiveNow! Tv app on my tablet. It's wonderful for trashy scifi &amp; horror b movies. You'd love it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 23:19:11	@Nic_Nik Quite a few good channels on there, Prehistoric Women From Mars v Zombie Godzilla type of thing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 23:23:13	@Nic_Nik I just looked what's on. One channel has Teenage Zombies followed by Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things. All classy stuff,
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-05 07:57:24	Have to go shopping today, trying to put it off until there's a pub open.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-05 07:59:35	Worst thing about shopping since I started with the vegan thing is discovering almost everything has milk in it,
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-05 08:01:42	Wife had a curry Pot Noodle yesterday, I thought "Yum! Haven't had one of those for ages." It has cheese powder in it. Buggered again.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 09:24:39	Jet Ski racing championship in Doncaster this weekend is described as "star studded". Really? Go on then, name 1 jet ski racer.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 09:30:30	@GrahamSmyth Journalists possibly covering the event are barred from entering. Sorry :)
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 09:32:24	@GrahamSmyth The Worksop Water Wizard should be his official name, written on his prize cheque.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 14:26:32	Onto the now traditional Thursday evening, Lucha Underground, ROH and NXT. Showing WWE Raw that 3 hours of Wrestling can be entertaining.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 14:45:55	End of Lucha Underground made me interested in a possible Vampiro match for the first time since...well, ever.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 14:51:51	Lineker's new 5 year BBC Football deal must be good. There isn't enough money in the world to make me share an office with Clem &amp; Crooks
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 15:31:08	Watching NXT. Always talk of Balor, Zayn, Itami going up to the main roster but why not Tyler Breeze? Good wrestler and tremendous character
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 16:12:17	@BustyRhodes If they were honest he'd be introduced as "They call him Bro"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 16:18:08	Showing Sami Zayn's surgery on NXT. If it was Cena he'd have kicked out.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 16:36:05	FIFA paying off the FAI over the Henry handball just goes to show, doesn't matter who runs things, who gets the World Cup, they're all bent.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 16:38:13	FA want a World Cup? They offered gifts and funny handshakes, Aussies? Paid a fortune. All crooked all day long.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 16:40:52	@Fydsy Olympics just as bad, as was shown in Salt Lake a few years ago. Bribes are bribes.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-04 16:45:04	@Fydsy Back scratching big bucks. Money is made off tournaments to go to development etc. Paying up front to get the tournament is dodgy.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-06 18:47:49	Neither team wearing an unnecessary away kit?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-06 18:53:05	That's the thing with Italian defences, always difficult to break down... #UCLfinal
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-06 19:12:07	Had to wipe the TV screen. I can never be sure if one of the kids has smeared snot on it or a footballer has a new haircut.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-06 19:36:04	I think 45 minutes of ridiculous haircuts falling over is quite enough for one evening.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-06 19:42:28	@neillyfabi Tremendous amount of diving too as usual.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 17:16:02	Once again,  American Police considering it illegal to be Black in public.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 17:25:36	#WWC2015 on the BBC over on the red button due to live car parking on the main channels.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 18:10:26	@magic_bert @HOPEWrestling @C_garzz Tremendous, even by your standards Mr Hadley.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 18:18:37	@mophead_88 I lived Doncaster town centre for a while and once suffered a distant Tinchy Stryder at the Keepmoat.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 18:27:54	@footballspoon @mophead_88 Saw Red Hot Chilli Peppers when Wet Wet Wet had that number 1 for months, they played it as an encore.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 18:33:24	"Not the worst penalty you've ever seen" says the commentator as Norway miss one. Must be a close runner up though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 18:47:58	@footballspoon Getting there.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 20:03:38	Yay Sue Smith on commentary...oh, Jonathan Pearce. #mutebutton
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 20:21:02	On the bright side for the Ivory Coast team, Canada is very nice this time of year.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 20:29:45	3-0 Germany. Get your coat d'ivoire. #WWC2015
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 20:35:14	@rainedonparade @ferretimp Wouldn't be like Lincoln City then .
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 20:38:58	Not sure if the Ivory Coast goalie was injured there or contemplating suicide #WWC2015
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 20:42:55	German coach diving now. #AgainstModernFootball
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 20:46:55	Ivory Coast goalie at halftime will make demands. "We're in Canada, get me a helmet, pads and a bloody big stick or I'm off home" #WWC2015
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 20:57:21	Germany v Ivory Coast is one sided, but it's no Germany v Brazil semi final.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 20:59:37	I can't see a performance quite like the Ivory Coast goalie for the rest of the tournament. Get a medal made for her right now. #WWC2015
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 07:45:20	Watching last night's #WWC2015 Canada v China game. Pitchside billboards say #bethedifference .Not sure who Beth Edifference plays for.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 08:38:40	Iplayer only has the 1st half of Canada v China. Let's hope the rest of the tournament is a little better treated.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 08:40:49	@footballspoon Not sure what's happened. It says 145 minutes on the page, but goes off at half time after 75 minutes of the programme.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 08:44:50	@footballspoon Or Golf. There'd be 8 hours solid of that.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-08 10:35:21	Warm and sunny for a couple of days, but of course just as a load of washing finishes, it turns black over the back of Bill's Mother's.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 12:51:15	Sprotbrough v Hoylandswaine, Barnsley Cricket League. (@ The Ivanhoe) https://t.co/CM0rrGvjsQ
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 13:07:18	Must read website fixture lists more attentively. Walked up to watch a Cricket match which doesn't start until next Sunday.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 13:08:29	Still, every cloud and that. Gorgeous day &amp; the pub at the ground has Sam Smiths at £1.80 a pint.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 13:14:30	Another advantage to heading out this afternoon is I appear to be missing a predictably horrendous England friendly.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 15:26:30	@pudp1e Luckily a pub on the ground.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 17:35:53	6 foot Norwegian Vikings 3, 4 foot 6 Thai Ladyboys 0. Very competitive game this one #WWC2015
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 17:45:38	When a team is clearly outclassed at a tournament you hope they win a game, score a goal or like Thailand at #WWC2015 , complete a pass.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 17:54:34	@SCFCRoss I was added to an "Influential UK Writers" list last week. Blogs and fanzines clearly going up in the world.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 18:02:03	Definitely worth a read, go grab one. https://t.co/LAGQszWuPq
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 18:26:17	4th goal for Norway. Thailand certainly making a great deal of effort 2nd half, but are pretty inept with the ball.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 20:01:19	#WWC2015 begins properly now, Germany are on.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 21:36:25	I saw #DRFC lose 8-0 twice in the same season. This is nothing Ivory Coast, nothing. #WWC2015
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 21:40:36	"Have Germany scored"
"Nine"
"So it's still 0-0?"
"Nein"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 21:48:40	@chris_sharp18 @newhallunitedfc I was at a 13-0 a few weeks ago, Germany have work to do.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 21:52:37	I'd like one more goal as Elf is my 2nd favourite German number after Funf.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 22:05:10	Put Wrestletalk TV on for the first time in months. Vince Russo is on. Switch Wrestletalk TV off for months.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-07 22:10:31	Another point on that show, Marty Scurll, Mark Haskins &amp; Tommy End are almost certainly triplets.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 09:27:07	If #DRFC were after Tom Pope, it doesn't say much for our allure now he's reportedly signing for Bury today.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 09:32:06	@markusparkus75 He's OK at our level, hardly the final piece in a promotion push but better than what we have.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 09:33:01	@markusparkus75 Also suggests we have bugger all budget if we lose out on players like that to Bury.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 09:37:49	@markusparkus75 I'd assume we have a couple more irons in the fire, but you have to wonder how good they'll be.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 09:46:26	@markusparkus75 They were the days, rickets, smallpox, Saunders.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 09:50:27	@markusparkus75 Read a groundhopper's blog end of season awards the other day. Raffle prize of the year was at Atherton, a bag of meat.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 09:57:05	@markusparkus75 They're classy in Lancashire. Probably lucky to get the bag.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 10:15:48	@RealKrisTravis By next year, become a fitness model &amp; have a boob job. You'll walk it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 11:13:16	Catching up on the #WWC2015 games, Cameroon are alot of fun to watch. Look forward to seeing them against 1 of the top teams.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 18:41:19	Whoever made that "Go teams go" placard needs to be throttled with a half and half scarf.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 18:42:58	@ian601 Then beat them with a hockey stick.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 18:51:54	Very poor England. Colombia &amp; Mexico are no mugs, may not even get out of the group.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 19:02:45	@neillyfabi My Wife pointed out that while other teams look like athletes, we look like typical dumpy Brits with big backsides.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 15:20:43	Watching last night's USA v Australia game. With a name like Umpierez, there's only one job the ref was ever going to do.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-10 13:16:42	#DRFC sign a goalie who last season lost his place to the goalie we used to have.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-10 13:18:17	It is appropriate of #DRFC though that a team with a Viking badge sign a player named Thor. Just hope we don't get hammered...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-10 13:43:56	Paid a visit to @abite2eatscawsb earlier, really good food &amp; friendly. Will be a regular haunt from now on.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-10 13:45:34	Picked up some of @enchantedbakeri 's chocolate &amp; strawberry cupcakes from there too. Glorious. If I wasn't already married...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 17:01:47	England v France on. Not enthusiastic about our chances, but you never know. #WWC2015
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 17:06:13	Windswept rainy weather. Should have played somewhere warmer. I hear Qatar is nice. #WWC2015
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 17:30:52	Predictably, England huff and puff and go 1-0 down.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 17:43:35	Sue Smith talking about all the support staff in the French setup. We have an inspirational hashtag.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 17:47:40	Painful to watch from England.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 17:59:38	@jcw_72 Won't have to think too long about that.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 18:04:09	Winterton Rangers must be one of the more obscure teams represented on a flag at an England game.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 18:14:38	French player tried to do Jill Scott there. Not just late, knew exactly what she was doing.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 18:27:03	Elbow to the face followed by a headbutt on Houghton. Is the ref actually watching this game?
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 18:29:58	@NonLeagueCrowd The ref of Cameroon v Ecuador yesterday was awful, 3 penalties &amp; 1 red card, all of which were wrong.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 18:31:37	@rainedonparade Deliberate headbutt on Houghton immediately after too. Should be 3 off for France today.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-09 18:35:52	@rainedonparade Some awful refereeing in the tournament so far.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 19:36:28	On Meadowhall station with a couple of Scunthorpe fans who left too. Takes a great deal of frustration to agree with our 6 fingered cousins.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 21:12:02	The entirety of my football tonight. Cracking warm up... http://t.co/RQ19Q7JXYT
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 09:35:36	Watched some cricket, had some sunshine, off to my first match of 2015/16 tonight, England u21s v Belarus at Oakwell. Winter is on the way.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-12 11:39:01	South Yorkshire Wrestling fans, @EBW_NCWA are running Montgomery Hall in Wath tonight, all their regulars plus @Ligero1 &amp; Antonio Thomas.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-12 11:41:17	One for the diary , August 15, Queens Social, Sheffield, @phoenixevents4 have Grado, Drew Galloway, Chris Masters, Rampage Brown &amp; Lionheart
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 09:41:15	Look forward to seeing Harry Kane tonight, before his inevitable pop star marriage, nightclub fights &amp; ends up in the reserves at Rochdale.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 09:48:07	Clay Cross move to CMFL South (via @gibbons_craig ). Westella &amp; Bilsthorpe moved, chance for a Doncaster winner? https://t.co/NCMxhxLU9E
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 09:50:29	@gibbons_craig I seem to remember them saying at the end of last season they'd probably move south.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 09:52:46	@gibbons_craig @BilsthorpeFC Just looked down their twitter. Mentions that with all the other movement they'll probably stay north.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 09:59:09	@gibbons_craig @BilsthorpeFC Not heard of anyone moving in South Yorks, either from the County Senior or Doncaster Senior leagues.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 10:04:10	@gibbons_craig Always possible. It could make things awkward for the Notts teams to move a couple north.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 10:31:30	@Saintbarca @SexPissedDolls I'll keep an eye out for them.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-12 16:25:59	Little Plough, ordered a pint of Barnsley. After last night I'll probably choke on it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-12 18:42:45	@jmsutton I left early, went on the train &amp; didn't want to get stuck with the last one after the delayed kickoff.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-12 21:02:41	In Donny wearing a @vivarovers shirt. Told twice in Cask Corner &amp; once in the street the same "It's fucking ace". Good job Glen.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-12 21:09:27	@Lee_Hodgkinson I'll post a pic later for you with wifi at home. In the Woolpack back yard at the moment.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-12 21:32:40	Band in the Diamond Lounge with the best singer I've heard in years. A young Jania Joplin. As they say round here, a reyt gob on her.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 16:56:44	In the glamour capital of The North, Barnsley. Football begins again, mere moments after it finished.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 16:58:52	In the Old No.7 pub, great little place with a wide choice of real ale. Sadly, Dawkins Green Barrel is the wrong choice. #swampwater
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 17:08:46	Pubs are different before international games. A Dad with a rucksack of provisions while his kid sits with an England shirt &amp; colouring book
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-12 23:31:52	@vivarovers The stylish one. Just posted a pic with you tagged.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-12 23:35:05	Here's one for @Lee_Hodgkinson who wanted to know that @vivarovers shirts are available at http://t.co/jBU3SjrmR3 http://t.co/lFTUfTK32k
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 17:33:17	Tried to go all @mophead_88 &amp; grab a pint in the Joseph Bramah 'Spoons, but the 3 Lion-ed horde at the bar would have put him off too.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 17:35:55	Sat out front of the Courthouse pub after discovering my usual Barnsley go to, The Grogger's Rest, is boarded up. A sad day.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 17:39:18	The other late lamented Barnsley pub was the Iron Engine, where I was once served by a teen with a baby on her hip &amp; a roll up on her lip.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 18:25:52	Beer offering at Oakwell tonight is cans of Worthingtons. A bit like at @SLAquaFC ,except they give you Johns &amp; a smile.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 18:28:57	Just saw Dusty Rhodes has died. Dammit. Sweet dreams Dream.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 18:43:13	Kickoff delayed til 815 "due to congestion". Every time I come to Oakwell there's some organisational cock up. Bunch of fucking amateurs.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 18:46:37	KO delay means a later train and not home until half past midnight. There's a brewery nearby, Barnsley couldn't organise a piss up in it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-12 23:53:46	@MattBeaverESPN Do the @WWE not realise dinosaurs are predetermined? #kayfabosaurus
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-13 00:37:09	@jtlovell1979 Summer's here at last.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-13 00:39:14	Off to bed. Going to tell my Wife I'm the Welsh football team. She won't be expecting much but I might surprise her...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 19:06:12	On Barnsley station. A train is arriving on time. Says alot when Northern Rail are more organised than an international football match.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-11 19:11:25	Barnsley can't get under 10,000 in a ground by 745. Try not closing the West Stand idiots. Shan't step foot in the place again.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-14 16:03:17	Time for the living death of an England game.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-14 16:09:08	@ian601 Probably for the best.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-13 19:16:00	Kirby starts for England tonight, hopefully a sign of some actual attacking intent. Set up like they did v France &amp; they may as well go home
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-13 19:59:13	I may watch far too much wrestling, but I'm always disappointed when Mexican footballers don't play in masks &amp; a cape.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-13 20:10:23	Why is Kirby having to defend near the England corner flag? #WWC2015
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-13 20:18:35	@neillyfabi I always think that. Style of play is very pedestrian, a bit unorganised, easily picked off by good teams.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-13 20:51:46	After a game and a half, no goals &amp; no real sign of any forthcoming. A long pointless trip to  Canada. #WWC2015
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-13 21:26:41	About time. Scruffy goal but they all count #WWC2015
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-13 21:38:25	Lovely goal from Carney. Different team since she &amp; Greenwood came on.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-13 21:47:35	Bardsley is horrendous. If she tried to catch a cold she'd fumble it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-14 16:15:46	Sterling is very good at looking disappointed with himself.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-14 16:40:39	Always good that England games occasionally break up the boredom with huge peals of laughter.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-14 17:22:07	ITV "Sorry for the disruption, we're working to fix the issue" Oh good, they're going to show Wales again.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-14 17:36:02	Rooney takes elbow to the jaw, goes down holding his bald patch.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-12 15:34:53	@markusparkus75 Yes, I'll head to the Plough for a bit.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-12 15:50:59	@markusparkus75 I'll grab the train to town in half an hour, so should be there 530-6.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-14 07:07:13	Football today, American version this time. @Donnymustangs take on division leading Edinburgh Wolves at the Keepmoat Athletics stadium.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-14 17:17:08	Surely no coincidence that England score while Sterling is on the floor out of the way.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-14 17:54:59	Entertaining enough 2nd half, but England still showing why they'll be slapped by the 1st good team they face in the finals.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-15 17:06:05	Just watched Alpha Papa. Sloppy of Sean Pertwee sending Alan Partridge into the siege when his Dad was Doctor Who &amp; he raised Batman.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-17 06:51:04	Wife's birthday, when the kids get jump up and down on her while finding new ways to rhyme 'Happy birthday to you' with 'poo'.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-17 16:39:24	Kids watching the new Clangers on CBeebies. Probably the first remake without Tom Cruise in it.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-17 16:50:06	@Scotty_SL Not quite CGI, but it's an upgrade on the old wool Clangers.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-17 16:53:19	@Scotty_SL I wish they'd leave the old stuff alone and make decent new ones.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-17 16:59:53	@Scotty_SL  The new Thunderbirds is awful. British TV is just cheap and unimaginative currently.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-17 17:01:22	@Scotty_SL Ha! I might actually watch that.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-17 17:07:28	@Scotty_SL Geoffrey in a Sailor Moon outfit would make it all worthwhile.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-17 17:16:49	@Scotty_SL Parliament is full of them.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-17 18:13:00	BBC3 has David Beckham Into The Unknown, in tonight's episode he plays beach football. While stretching the definition of "unknown"...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-17 18:43:53	Labour leader's debate, winner gets a 5 year term as Michael Foot. #onefortheteenagers
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 16:26:22	#DRFC chasing a namesake of a classic singer. All the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 17:19:40	The DFP #DRFC questionnaire. Shallow, lazy &amp; failed to ask the important questions like "Is Louis Tomlinson your favourite popstar?"
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-17 19:58:57	Typically polite of the Canadians to host the England game in a Colombian coloured stadium.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-17 20:17:22	Colombia on the ropes here, if England can grab a second it's game over.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-17 21:04:02	TV camerawork at the Women's World Cup very different from the Men's. We're yet to have a single crowd shot of a huge breasted Man.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-19 13:41:29	#DRFC sign Andy Williams, your job now @BlackBank_DRFC is to raid your Grandad's record collection &amp; knock up a decent chant.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-17 21:54:06	England made hard work of that, should have won by more. Need to be much sharper up front in the KO rounds.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-19 13:43:22	@tomsbfc @BlackBank_DRFC And hopefully not shoot wider than a mile.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 19:23:37	Watching the new #WWEToughEnough in despair at the contestants, then up pops Michael Hayes from OVW. Reason to keep watching.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-19 18:02:28	@markusparkus75 Not out tonight I'm afraid.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 21:11:34	With @MonkeySquadOne &amp; @Aswimtobirds in there, I may need some of that. https://t.co/hcCEXVAeu5
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 22:30:23	@Lee_Hodgkinson It's the kind of thing you'd expect to fill a high school paper. Lazy.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 22:46:10	Ending the night with episode 2 of @TrekkerTalk , great podcast about the mighty @Ron_Randall 's Trekker series. If you read it, go listen.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 22:54:11	@TrekkerTalk @Ron_Randall Keep up the great work.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 19:47:21	Huge list of pre season Non League Football fixtures courtesy of @robhornby . Some great games around.

185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 19:52:22	12-5 Saturday, Hillsborough Arena, is the @sheffREDSvBLUES charity game. South Yorks ex pros &amp; other sportsmen play &amp; events all day.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-19 07:52:48	Revamp rundown 60's shopping centre by re-erecting revamped rundown 60's statue. https://t.co/FZxwwGWV3p
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 20:00:56	Diary filling up. Hull Utd v Barnton, Hemsworth v Willington Quay Saints, @RossingtonMain v Ilkeston...Football is back kids!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 21:17:00	@MonkeySquadOne @Aswimtobirds Secret, Schmecret.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 21:17:43	@Aswimtobirds Definitely keeping an eye out for the release.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 21:33:03	@AliceRadley Did you ever see Air Force One by Bolin? Looks very similar, just cheap.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 21:34:04	@AliceRadley Upside down though.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 21:34:57	@AliceRadley Bless his little cotton socks.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 21:38:12	@Grasberry73 @AliceRadley Well, she has to earn her keep...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 22:15:41	Always enjoy Angels winning games on the radio, but if I hear it's Super Summer Saver Sizzler time at Irvine Auto Centre one more time...
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 22:28:22	7-1 Angels win. You see what happens when you play at a respectable time for UK fans? Enough of this 330am nonsense.
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 23:00:45	I got a mention near the end of @TrekkerTalk ! Fame at last!
185177025	TonyCSGreenall	2015-06-18 23:02:08	@Ron_Randall @TrekkerTalk No, thank you Mr Randall.
