1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:17:32	Shasta LAFCO action.  http://t.co/Vd4zeweaeB
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:17:58	LAFCO board member Les Baugh questioned timing of report to Bella Vista. Says reports aren't going out in a timely fashion.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:19:45	LAFCO CEO Jan Lopez says it's up to LAFCO, but they haven't been maintained in the past.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:20:20	Lopez took over last year with goal of getting LAFCO back on track (lot of backstory there).
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:23:33	Kehoe asks attorney Jim Underwood if board could act on Baugh's observations. Moves to discuss notice process for public hearings.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:25:33	But since it's not on the agenda today Kehoe rescinds motion. Talking now about placing it on future agenda for action.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:26:21	Brenda Haynes says that may be a good move to uphold LAFCO's credibility, but notes past litigation that led to fast timeline.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:26:47	I hope I'm being coherent here. This is a lot of info to fit in 120 character updates...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:27:34	Irwin Fust notes the board approved the aggressive timeline months ago, so LAFCO is just following orders.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:28:11	LAFCO's fast timeline may be too fast for some district, Fust says. Creek Creek on today's agenda needed changes even today.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:28:48	*Clear Creek. Not Creek Creek. #autocorrectfail
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:30:49	Dick Fyten says previous CEO created bad habits for local districts, and the commission allowed it. Fingers points back at the board, too.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:31:50	Baugh and Kehoe take issue. Baugh says he's not pointing fingers, but trying to clarify process.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:32:17	Ok. Moving on. Public hearing for Bella Vista Water Dist opens. No one speaks. Continued to Dec 18 meeting.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:33:10	Clear Creek CSD pub hearing up now. Kurt Born, GM of Dist, at mic. Says there are still a few small issues with MSR/SOI doc, but satisfied.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:37:00	Haynes notes preparing the docs is a big undertaking and thanks Born for working on it.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:39:58	Twitter is showing me an ad from the auction company the just sold Anselmo Vineyards.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:40:17	Yes, I'm definitely in the market for $1 mill+ real estate...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:43:05	Clear Creek CSD received about 1/5 of normal water amount from Bureau of Reclamation this year due to drought, Born says.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:48:47	After much discussion, Irwin Fust says there are still a number of deets in the doc that still need to be cleared up.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:49:33	The board  is going over a number of discrepancies now, including how many wells can pump at once in the district. (It's 2, not 3)
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:51:15	Can the doc be approved today with updates discussed added on? Attorney Underwood says he thinks so. Pub hearing closed.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:58:07	This would be the first sphere of influence update for Clear Creek CSD since 1986. A vote could be coming soon...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:58:58	Bam. There's the voted. Update to Clear Creek CSD passes unanimously with minor changes discussed.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:59:54	Kent Manual (sp) with city of Redding is addressing LAFCO on proposed Redding update now. Says the city need a few more weeks to review.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 18:00:41	@jennyespino_RS thank you! Go team.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 18:01:11	Manuel says Dec 18 meeting would likely work for city.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 18:02:06	Haynes says she wants to see details about Redding's unfunded pension liabilities in report to gauge financial health.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 18:03:11	Baugh said that info is already in there under the budget section. I haven't made it through all my light reading yet..
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 18:04:00	Baugh questions why LAFCO would highlight one budget item over another. Haynes says she's not an auditor and would like a paragraph noting..
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 18:04:58	Larry Farr wonders what impact those obligations would have for LAFCO decisions. Lopez says little to none.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 18:05:28	BUT it could come up if city seeks to annex land sometime in the future, Lopez says.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 18:09:34	Board still discussing if pension liability notes would be relevant in any way. The short: maybe, kind of, possibly, or not.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 18:10:51	Board moves to have city of Redding include pension liability obligations. Baugh says every agency should be required to produce same info.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 18:11:19	That would require a separate vote, which Baugh says should happen if required of Redding.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 18:12:26	Motion fails 5-2 vote. Pension liability discuss now over (I think). Public hearing continued to Dec 18 meeting.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 18:14:00	On to Buckeye Fire Protection District public hearing. Lopez says district has shrunk in size but unsure how it got there.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 18:14:36	Lopez says she plans to review docs recently unearthed by Redding officials. It could impact Redding and Shasta Lake boundaries.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 18:14:52	Buckeye hearing also continued to Dec 18.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 18:20:15	Ok. This LAFCO meeting is over.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:06:32	Hearing on Bella Vista Water District SOI, scheduled for today, may be continue at district's request.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:09:34	Yep. City of Redding will also be seeking a continuance today.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:10:24	They way it works, they'll open public comment on Bella Vista and Redding, but continue it until next meeting w/o resolving.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:11:24	At issue in Redding are old agreements between the Buckeye special district and city of Redding. Evidently docs were hard to find.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:12:10	Buckeye Fire District hearing was also on agenda today but may be pushed out for same reason.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:18:38	Baugh says LAFCO should rethink spending money to notice public hearing when docs aren't going out in time. Kehoe agrees.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:19:15	James Yarbrough questions who maintains those documents and related files.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-11-20 17:24:36	Motion: 1) reschedule fast-pace public hearing goals 2) send out notice for pub hearing only after draft docs are prepared.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-02 17:22:24	34-page annual report should be available on county's website by Friday, Morgan says.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-02 17:26:43	Not sure if this is legible, but here's the breakdown of stats Morgan was just discussing: http://t.co/WQQHrQ9Ax0

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-02 18:21:10	I missed her name, but she says while raises for those county employees are appreciated, pay is still very low. $9.64 hr

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-02 18:40:18	Kehoe says closure seems irrational on surface. Local mail would be trucked 160 miles to Sac for sorting, then back to Redding area.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-02 19:11:06	Fields-Hosler says it would apply to the entire county, not just unincorporated areas, b/c cities have deferred pub health matters to county
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-02 19:12:17	Kehoe asks if ban would cover federal and tribal buildings in county..
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-02 19:13:07	County Counsel Rubin Cruse says he hasn't researched that but doesn't believe those buildings would be covered under county jurisdiction.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-12 20:35:09	Cal trans says 1 lane of WB 44 should be closes next 1-2 hours as they chop off any loose concrete. I'm going to leave them to it.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-12 20:35:19	I'm heading back to the office now.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-12 20:46:12	I'm back in the office. Dispatchers on the scanner say Cal Trans workers called in and said it was unsafe for us reporters to be out there.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-12 15:16:35	If you're heading toward Reno this morn, heads up. Dispatchers are reporting a jack knifed big rig blocking Hwy 44 east of Old Station.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-12 19:46:44	.@CaltransD2 crews have most of the concrete off WB Hwy 44 now. Traffic slowed, but passing http://t.co/OgdUnpU6gV
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-12 19:52:24	Here's a better pic of the damage. Debris is cleaned up but crews still discussing next steps. http://t.co/7sb8CFmyG6
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-12 20:13:13	I got a little turned around. The overpass hit is the off ramp from NB I5 to WB 44 heading toward downtown Redding. Not I5 proper.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-12 20:21:19	Chris Brace, an associate bridge engineer with @CaltransD2, says there appears to be no structural damage to the bridge.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-12 20:21:38	Crews may have to close a lane of WB 44 to knock off any loose concrete tho.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-12 21:03:49	Updates on backhoe vs. overpass --&gt; http://t.co/sWgVCMdiYq Traffic may be slow on WB Hwy 44 heading into downtown Redding for a bit..
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-12 23:14:49	@i5trucker On the side of Hwy 44, re: http://t.co/ghAUDVS8nn

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:47:43	@graciouspalmer yes he talked with the thief that robbed him.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:49:21	Cassano says he has a press release from NJ where 3M paid for polluting streams near quarry there.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:50:07	Bosenko up again. Asks Brandon Williams (I think) to come down. http://t.co/XXW4gihcgS
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:50:54	Bosenko says Williams, who owns Sunrise Excavating, stepped up and donated tons of sand, bags and manpower to help w/ storm prep.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:51:11	Bosenko presents a certificate of appreciation. Crowd applauds.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:51:28	Williams: "it's all we could do to help"
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:53:39	Williams: "We didn't get much other business done but hopefully we helped save a few homes"
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:58:43	Janice Powell now speaking about Moody Flats Quarry. Says she's a local activist doing what she can to stop this "environmental disaster"
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:00:14	Powell says gov't has failed to protect environment for people.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:01:00	Powell says fines for violating rules are considered costs of doing business for many companies.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:02:20	Cassandra Carter up now. She's with the CA United Homecare Workers, whose bargaining unite is currently negotiating with county.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:08:11	Moving on, consent calendar passed unanimously.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:16:42	10 minute break at #shastagov supervisors meeting before getting to rest of agenda.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:21:38	Ok. Supervisors back in action.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:22:08	@mariasaporta welcome to the west coast. Thanks for the follow.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:23:10	To be clear this letter would be in response to the Shasta County Grand Jurors Association, not he grand jury itself.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:23:47	Moty says he's kind of wondering what's going on with 2 grand jury groups doing separate work.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:25:38	Kehoe says he'd like some clarification. County spends staff time prepping responses to grand jury, then a sep group asks for more info?
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:27:43	Moty motions to send letter. Kehoe notes it's being sent as a courtesy. Passes unanimously.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:34:18	Baugh says he wants to recognize someone w/ 15 yrs of service to county, tho he knows that person will object. Calls Kehoe down to podium.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:35:00	Baugh presents Kehoe with a pin commemorating his service. http://t.co/Hk8VnwAYG3
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:35:19	Kehoe gets standing ovation.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:36:45	Next, R7: MOU with Teamsters Local #137  would give 5% pay raises over next 2 yr period.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 19:38:02	Moty notes raises are part of county's efforts to restore pay cuts workers saw during recession.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:01:36	Hess takes issues with prezo Andrew Deckert gave on negative impacts of e-cigs.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:03:43	Hess asks for an exemption allowing e-cig testing indoors at Vape-only stores
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:04:34	Robert Jensen (sp) asks for Vape shop exemption. Says LA County made same exemption for Vape shops.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:05:37	I missed this lady's name, but she is also asking for an exemption for Vape shops. Says e-cigs helped ween her of cigarettes.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:08:39	Jeff Hess now up. Thanks supervisors for looking at all info presented about electronic smoking devices and what's known about their impacts
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:09:38	Jeff Hess says they collected 433 signatures supporting exemptions for Vape shops.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:10:01	Jeff Hess worries ban could put his biz, Nor Cal Vape, out of business.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:10:22	They are in process of relocating to former Vintner Cellar space in downtown Redding.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:11:48	Hess supports exemptions for 100% Vape shops and would like county to create permit process for Vape shops.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:13:12	Sorry I missed this lady's name too. She works at Shasta Community Health and supports ban.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:14:13	She says its a nation-wide issue, but ordinance is a good local step to promote health.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:14:54	Beth Thompson w/ tobacco education coalition says she talks to people in LA and exemption for Vape shops there has created confusion.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:16:54	Psy Rose (sp) up now. Says there's a lot of info flying around not citing sources.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:18:56	Rose is giving a demo on how vaporizing works http://t.co/b5f2ft9s7p
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:19:38	He supports an exemption for Vape shops. Says hose stores could pay a fee and be inspected.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:20:32	Charles Zink up now. Apologies if thoughts are scattered. Says he forgot his notes at home.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:21:47	Zink says he supports ban but asks for an exemption for exclusive e-cig stores.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:24:05	Charles Alexander asks, if supervisors ban e-cigs, where does it end? Banning fast food to keep kids from eating it?
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:25:29	Alexander calls on board to rescind earlier action a approving e-cig ban.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:27:43	John Murphy says he's a certified addiction specialist.Says ppl need to be able to test Vape before purchase to know it works.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:29:17	Public comment period on e-cig ban now wrapping up. Kehoe asks Deckert to come back up and share his medical perspective.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:31:52	Deckert pulls out an FDA recommendation for regulating e-cigs. Org wants all e-cigs approved and to include health warnings.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:36:11	County counsel Rubin Cruse says any exemption would have to be based on reason. Allowing exempt may open county up to legal action.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:36:44	Moty points out ordinance does ban e-cigs, just limits where you can use them.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:37:20	Sorry if not clear. I do what I can with 120 characters.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:39:48	Moty says he doesn't support an exemption and would like to move forward with ordinance as passed.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:40:20	Moty says he realizes testing is important but thinks industry will adapt. Makes motion to approve ordinance. Giacomini seconds.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:41:29	Baugh says he thinks an exemption would open the door for other businesses to ask for exemptions.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:42:03	Bam. Motion passes unanimously. Supervisors uphold early vote to ban smoking e-cigs in businesses, county buildings.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:43:23	Last public agenda item, transferring land to Pacheco Elem School Dist in exchange for fence construction along Knighton Rd.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:43:42	Baugh says it is a massive public safety issue. Will elaborate.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:44:28	This vote would not transfer the land, but would start discussion with the school district to potential find an agreement.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:45:01	Really, this is to see if supervisors have the appetite to consider the idea.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:45:55	@NewsFletch @CityofRoseville thanks for not calling it a traffic circle. Not sure why but that's one of my pet peeves.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:49:00	The problem is people drop kids off on Knighton Road to avoid the time it takes to get into school parking lot, and it's dangerous.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:49:29	That's paraphrased from Pat Minturn, who is presenting on the topic. Says there are still details to work out, but...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:49:56	School wants to build fence to prevent that from happening and protect kids.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:50:33	School district wants land to build fence, and in return would build and maintain fence, which could be expensive.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:51:40	@graciouspalmer I just don't like the term 'traffic circle' I have no problem with use of roundabouts.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 20:53:41	Wow. I just turned around. 50 people here at start of meeting. 6 left now. Half of those speaking on last agenda item.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 21:04:05	Supervisors are going over map of Pacheco Elementary to understand proposal for fence.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 21:04:35	Would be 6-foot iron fence to stop kids from getting dropped on Knighton Rd. At least that's the idea.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 21:10:14	Kehoe questions if parents are really dropping kids on the side of Knighton Road if it's not safe. Baugh says he has seen it himself.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 21:13:19	Moty: what about kids biking or walking to school? Superintendent says there aren't any kids walking in except a few from immediate side st.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 21:14:43	Schappell asks what would county liabilities be if it just did a land lease? County counsel says docs could be drafted to provide protection
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 21:16:18	Kehoe says he's not particularly interested in the county giving up the property.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 21:17:04	This isn't a vote. It would be to direct county staff to look at finding a favorable agreement for property and fence.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 21:18:44	Moty says he is concerned that property may be needed for future widening of Knighton Road and doesn't want to give t up if that's he case
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 21:19:24	Giacomini says there seems to be numerous options forward and the county should look into them, even w/o selling property.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 21:20:03	@graciouspalmer they're discussing that idea too. This decision would just direct staff to consider options.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 21:21:05	Ok. Board votes 4-1 to look into options. Moty qualifies his vote saying he has 'serious reservations.' Kehoe votes against.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 21:21:45	Sorry I miss-tweeted earlier. There was a vote to direct staff, but not a final vote to decide anything related to property/fence
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 21:22:10	Supes now heading to closed session. For me this meeting is over.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 23:43:41	@LovesMoose Ha! I'm a journalist and suck at math. That's the best I've got.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 16:54:37	About 7 minutes to start of #shastagov supervisors meeting. 40+ folks in the room today. http://t.co/CcEjMONip9
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:03:15	There's the gavel. This #shastagov supervisors meeting has started.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:03:46	Board chair Les Baugh says there are many many many requests to speak today.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:05:57	Up first, supes will present a certificate to Senior Veteran Services Rep Elizabeth Galos, who is retiring after 14 yrs.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-17 02:02:05	Bit of a crowd at Anderson council meeting tonight. Wonder if they heard a police puppy would be here... http://t.co/jUBgfJcMmp
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-17 02:07:55	Anderson City Council is finishing up interviews for Planning Commission appointments. 5 in hot seats. http://t.co/50j2jfxbPa
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-17 02:25:49	Anderson council wrapping up planning commission interviews now. On the regular agenda.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:10:08	Baugh presents certificate of recognition to Elizabeth Gallos. http://t.co/j2RLjuQVxs
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:11:18	Up next, another certificate for Assistant Programmer Analyst Bruce Sutton, who is retiring after 36 years.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:12:03	Sutton has been helping keep the county's computer systems running since the 1970s.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:13:31	Baugh presents certificate of recognition on behalf of The Board of Supervisors to Bruce Sutton. http://t.co/KECpJo5CKp
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:15:16	Shasta County Court CEO Melissa Fowler-Bradley and Judge Greg Gaul to now present update on courthouse progress.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:16:12	Fowler-Bradley (MFB) up now. Says Gaul sends apologies, but couldn't attend. http://t.co/0mUMcpdxrT
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:16:35	MFB says they're working with architect and should complete prelim plans for new courthouse by June.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:17:24	MFB says the plan is to be moving into the new courthouse by early 2019, though hey hope it's sooner. Building will cost $78 mill
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:18:25	MFB says new courthouse should last county 50-75 years. Current court is 58 years old.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:19:09	New courthouse will go directly across Court St. from where current courthouse  is.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:19:56	MFB says jurors will enjoy a nice jury assembly room. There will be a six-story tower that contains courtrooms.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:20:42	That would make the two tallest buildings in Shasta County the courthouse and the jail, if I'm not mistaking.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 17:22:17	MFB says they've down scaled courthouse plans some but still plans for 14 courtrooms. Juvy courtroom would also be in new building.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:13:56	Says her suggestions aren't new ones, but did help put a spotlight on importance of issues.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:14:22	Bosenko says funding, of course, is biggest hurdle.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:14:42	Bosenko wraps up. Supes now asking questions.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:15:25	Pam Giacomini asks what Sheriff would do with patrol ops of jail annex reopened. Operations currently based out of that building.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:15:58	Bosenko says they're looking at moving into another county building that would be vacated by new court construction.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:16:41	Bosenko says capacity of annex would have to be reevaluated due to new state standards. Right now estimates to hold 65-80.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:20:34	Bosenko notes county has contract now to send inmates to fire camps but no inmates yet have qualified.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:21:49	Bosenko also says work camp inmates gets 2/3 credit for time incarcerated, meaning they're released much sooner.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:22:18	Bosenko says sheriff department is down 20 or more deputies compared with a decade ago.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:24:02	Moty says that brings up tough choices on priority for spending, if the county had money to spend.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:25:29	Bosenko says he'd like to have the board hold a workshop after first of year to look at sheriff operations.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:26:09	Baugh is making a proposal now to hold that workshop and find a path forward working with Safe City Project.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:31:16	Baugh stays workshop would be a huge undertaking to be led by CEO Larry Lees and his staff, but needs to be done.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:35:24	Lees says the county needs to go back and look at the recommendations to see what makes sense and where $ could come from ...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:35:46	... Hints that it would have to come from other programs/areas within county budget.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-16 18:38:52	Moty says board should maybe hold off on directing staff to start prepping workshop until talking with city of Redding about strategic plan

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:13:33	Letter relates to LAFCO approved of city of Shasta Lake sphere of influence update passed earlier this year...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:14:42	Baugh: Duckett says SL's request was to maintain same sphere equal to city limit boundaries, but LAFCO expanded.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:15:36	Baugh asks that letter be placed on next LAFCO agenda for reconsideration of  Shasta Lake's updated sphere.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:16:02	That ties into the proposed Moody Flats Quarry up in that next of the woods, but we'll wait until next meeting to get into that.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:26:20	Baugh: "my concern is there is a lot of things happening not at the direction of this board"
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:28:15	Baugh says Lopez and board chair Steve Morgan are out of line. This issue is way too thick to sum up in tweets.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:37:02	Back in session. Lopez is back. It appears her brief departure was unrelated to the discussion/agenda.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:44:03	Sorry for delay. It has been a busy morning, but there is now a story online about today's LAFCO meeting + some bg http://t.co/U93IezyFMi

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:48:48	For those that don't speak LAFCO lingo, SOI = sphere of influence, MSR = municipal service review.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:49:34	Bam. That update is approved. 8 left on the ballot. Up now, CSA #17 - Cottonwood.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:21:30	Stead wonders why the district should have to wait another 5 years to revisit updates to SOI/MSR.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:21:47	Stead asks his written comments be included with the Jones Valley report.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:28:28	Wallen says they knew water loss was an issue but was told by county 20%+ water loss rates were normal. Said she later learned that not true
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:29:12	Wallen: "because CSA 6 pushed for this (leak detection) survey there is now a strained relationship with Pub Works"

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:59:16	Up next, Bella Vista Water District.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 16:14:37	Dozens of kids &amp; families - &amp; even Santa himself - braved the rains for this Christmas shindig http://t.co/hSIXZNdZU8 http://t.co/vY84BfLoSj
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 16:15:49	Starting at 9 a.m. today I'll be rocking what will likely be a marathon Shasta LAFCO meeting as it works to complete 10 (!) studies/reviews.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:00:37	The good news? Redding City Council chambers have free wifi :) I'll be tweeting most of the day from Shasta LAFCO meeting here.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:02:31	And here we go. This #shastagov LAFCO meeting has started. Here's today's agenda: http://t.co/k7bgKK2wG5
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:04:21	Public comment now open. Chris Coby (sp) up first.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:06:16	Coby thanks LAFCO for work on Mnt. Gate CSD so her could (legally) get water from the district.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:06:34	"I think LAFCO is doing a good job at it," Coby says.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:07:13	And Coby is the only one that speaks during opening public comment. Moving on to agenda.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:07:31	@KGillespie_RS Don't worry, I packed a lunch.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:10:25	Kehoe pulls a letter regarding the Fall River Mills Fire Protection District off the consent calendar for discussion.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:29:56	Shasta Co Fire Chief Mike Hebrard takes to the podium. Baugh says one of Lopez's emails essentially called Hebrard a liar.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:31:03	Hebrard: I was not notified of a document combining fire districts in eastern ShastaCo before last meeting.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:31:32	Hebrard says he could spend all day refuting Lopez's response to his earlier comments and correspondence, but he's not going to do it.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:12:26	Aaanad we're back. For those just tuning in we're in the middle of a marathon Shasta LAFCO meeting.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:18:21	Lopez says there are still some issues related to boundaries between Redding and the Buckeye FPD, which caused continuation last meeting.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:18:59	Good news. My laptop power cord reaches the nearest outlet. #juicedup #partlikeajournalist
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:19:53	Lopez: "Reddign was expecting to have its SOI approved in 2008, but it never came back for a final reading."
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:20:04	*Redding
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:20:58	Kent Manuel, hubby of ex-RS reporter Laura Christman and Redding senior planner, now up to answer questions.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:26:39	Commish Dick Fyten asks if Redding plans to serve 3,000+ water customers in city limits currently served by other districts.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:30:05	No one stands to speak during public comment period. LAFCO passes update to Redding sphere unanimously.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:32:04	Lopez is offering update on status of Buckeye FPD. Says it's really confusing and unclear about boundaries and other issues.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:33:25	Gerry Gary, Dep. Fire Chief with city of Redding, is speaking. Says there has been no discuss of annexation b/w city and that district.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:34:54	.@ggfire343 says the fire department sent LAFCO all of the necessary info about Buckeye boundaries back in 2013.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:36:52	LAFCO this year told the dept it would have to resubmit relevant info, but @ggfire343 says the department told LAFCO it didn't have time
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:37:42	@zbonnin Thanks. I could remember his exact title, so I turned to Google.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:39:09	Lopez says she needed a lot of info from Buckeye FPD that LAFCO didn't get.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:40:36	Lopez says Buckeye FPD needs updated sphere, but doesn't make sense to do it w/o knowing exact boundaries.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:06:17	Public hearing now open. 7 requests to speak, chair Steve Morgan says.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:11:50	Hebrard says one map still shows Cassel included in the sphere for combined fire districts, which needs to be fixed if that passes.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:19:42	Hebrard says he has met with each fire district chief about this proposal to consolidate. Many district reps are here at the meeting.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:21:43	Hebrard hands LAFCO a map with sphere of influence boundaries he would like to see for the fire districts. Says he can't rep Lassen dist tho
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:22:19	...and the others to retain their autonomy.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:28:20	If 3 districts became 1, then they would only need 1 chief, for example, not 3.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:30:06	Cassity: "I don't know know what the correct answer is today in terms of the sphere of influence."
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:36:51	@mrogers_RS LOL. I'm still nowhere close to being done with this meeting.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:45:05	Bruce said it seemed simple for the McArthur and NW Lassen fire districts to combine to work together.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:45:31	Greg Marin, Chief of the Soldier Mnt. Fire Department up in that area, is speaking. They would like to stay independent.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:47:07	Don Sanberg (sp), assistant chief at Solider Mnt. FD, now speaking.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:50:33	And now Gene Rogers of Soldier Mnt. FD is speaking. Says future potential annex of their service area by other could hurt residents..
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 21:15:38	Sorry, Terry Briggs, not Jerry Briggs.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:32:41	I just looked up and it seems Lopez has stepped out of the room. Not sure why, or even if its related to discussion.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:33:06	Hebrard sums up saying he stands by his earlier comments regarding questions of eastern county fire district boundaries.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:35:48	Board takes a 5 min recess to figure out what happened to Lopez...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:53:04	Minturn says the district has the lowest sewer rates of in system in NorCal, but that will probably have to change soon.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:53:32	Minturn says those hikes are a must to help funded needed upgrades and maintenance in Cottonwood.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:54:00	I believe Cottonwood CSA #17 is the only sewer system the county runs. All of these other CSAs are water districts.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:55:02	I see a couple folks from CSA 6 - Jones Valley in the audience.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:55:30	Update to Cottonwood CSA pases unanimously. Making progress.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 17:59:34	There was about 40 people here at start of meeting. Looks like about 10 of those have left so far.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:05:32	@KGillespie_RS Yeah, I did, but not sure if it will reach. I may try when/if we take a recess. Didn't expect it to go quite so fast.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:07:11	And there goes Keswick. Updates to SOI/MSR approved unanimously. Jones Valley, CSA #6 now up.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:15:54	Steve Boyd of Jones Valley up to speak on CSA 6.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:24:11	Roy Vincent up now. Also a Jones Valley guy. Serves on the Community Advisory Board there. Talking to water loss in the district.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:33:28	Correct spelling: RT @ashulman_RS: @ClayDuda_RS Clydene Buchanan. I know my Elk Trail!
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:34:16	Scales says Pat Minturn took advantage of his ignorance and "screwed me to the max" when he was seeking water connection years ago.(2005ish)
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:37:15	A lot was just said. To sum up: Scales is not a fan of Pat Minturn. Public hearing on CSA 6 now closed.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 22:58:00	Former Trinity County undersheriff found not guilty in hit-run case despite leaving crash scene http://t.co/a19DS1OAyg
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-19 00:11:16	If you didn't get your fix already, here's a roundup of tweets from today's marathon Shasta LAFCO meeting http://t.co/s4Xn20HRUg
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:52:44	Commission is debatign whether to leave in comments from Jones Valley citizens.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:53:01	Baugh says he didnt see those types of comments included on any other SOI/MSR for other districts.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:54:13	Baugh says he's not trying to disenfranchise people, their comments would still be included in meeting minutes/admin records, but...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:54:47	but passing this with included comments would set precident to include all future comments from citizens.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:55:22	Baugh says he plans to vote no on the motion. Kehoe says he tends to agree.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:56:17	Both say including those comments would degrade the quality of the MSR doc.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 18:56:56	Haynes motion fails with a 3-4 vote. Baugh is making new motion removing those citizen comments from the MSR, plus other minor changes.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:00:08	Bella Vista Water District Manager David Coxey now speaking. Points to one correction, but says overalldoc looks pretty good.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:03:49	Unanimous vote passes Bella Vista Water District SOI/MSR update. 5 minute recess before hitting city of Redding.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:13:04	Up now, updates to city of Redding's sphere of influence. They want to scale it back.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:13:40	I have been told before that the city wants to reduce its sphere because it's unrealistic to expand into some areas currently covered.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:22:09	Manuel says LAFCO has made some needed updates to doc, but there are still a few others that need to be addressed.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:27:26	Manuel says no, mainly because exisitng water rights make it easier to keep things as-is.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:32:39	Lopez is requesting updates to Buckeye FPD be continued to next meeting in Feb. 2015.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:41:11	Answering questions, @ggfire343 says he isn't sure exactly what was submitted in 2013 b/c he didn't do it personally.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:41:44	Buckeye currently has a 0 sphere of influence and is being service by city of Redding under contract. Baugh asks if it should be resolved.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:42:06	Lopez says she can't make any sort of recommendation until she knows more about the district.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:43:14	LAFCO board decides to continue the Buckeye FPD update. Now to Fall Rivier Valley Coordination Fire Protection District.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:43:31	Lopez says last time this area was reviewed for fire protection services was 1986.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:44:02	@coalminersboy Thanks for clarifying!
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:45:17	Lopez is recommending two smaller fire districts near Fall River Mills combine to better serve the area.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:46:34	correction: would combine 3 districts, not 2, and expnad sphere of influence for new district.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:46:56	This ties in with earlier discussion and e-mails regardign Cal Fire chief and LAFCO CEO.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:47:41	It's also a topic that brought down both a reporter and editor from the Mountain Echo, which is rare.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:49:48	These are the fire districts and proposed sphere of influence for new district, if formed: http://t.co/cR9i6NgbXJ
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 19:51:10	Fall River Mills FPD has requested not to be included, tho, and if board honors that there are alternatives maps/options to consider.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:05:54	Lots of discussion on the intricacies of LAFCO regulations and its role.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:08:29	Jerry Monath of Fall River Mills up now. Says sphere or influence doesn't do 'a heck of a lot' but helps settles any service issues.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:09:18	Monath: "I live in the valley and the fire districts, they all repsond to fires in that valley."
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:09:40	Monath said he'd really like to see all of these fire districts combine because they all work together already.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:09:51	Cal Fire Chief Mike Hebrard now up.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:11:17	@mrogers_RS My stomach is already growling. Don't rub it in!
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:18:36	Hebrard takes issue with parts of the report, says earlier input from him and other fire officials should be taken seriously.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:22:07	I dont have a copy of that map (yet) but Hebrard says it would allow two districts that want to combine to do so...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:27:24	Hebrard wraps up. Brent Cassity w/ NW Lassen Fire Protect District now speaking.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:27:50	Cassity says it would make sense for some fire districts in the area to combine to cut overhead, if nothing else.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:38:51	Cassity is done. Joe Bruce w/ McArthur fire department up now.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:47:37	@mrogers_RS @C_Ferguson_RS I would if I could. They're on the interesting stuff now.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:48:05	@mrogers_RS @C_Ferguson_RS Y'all can pick me a prize, tho ;)
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:51:18	@mrogers_RS That gem? Why would@ashulman_RS give it up?!?
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:52:10	If y'all grow weary of my LAFCO tweets, check out @mrogers_RS updates from the RS holiday party. Gifts abound.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 20:58:55	Don Shay (sp) with Cassel Fire says he drove down because of an issue with the map that was erroneously included in some versions of agenda
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 21:00:15	Most of the folks left at this LAFCO meeting are East County firefighters. I wonder if they all carpooled...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 21:14:18	Jerry Briggs, who filed class action lawsuit a/g LAFCO, upnow. Says previous director didn't do in 8 yrs what Lopez has done in 8 mnths.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 21:16:03	Briggs: "We wouldnt be here today had the job gotten done 7 or 8 years ago."
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 21:16:43	Public hearing closed. Baugh thanks each person that took time to speak, thanking firefighters for their work.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 21:17:04	Baugh: "It's clear we're not going to be able to adopt this as it is today."
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 21:19:59	Baugh says he can't approve the reorganization as proposed today and makes motiont to continue public hearing until LAFCO meeting on Feb. 5.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 21:20:42	Kehoe seconds. Commissioners now talking details.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 21:24:20	After discussion, Shasta LAFCO votes unanimously to continue bid to consolidate NW Lassen &amp; McArthur FPDs to Feb. 5.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 21:24:56	Welp, tune in Feb. 5 for another public hearing on the same thing, with  potential boundary changes.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 21:26:09	LAFCO now looking at declaring a "0" sphere of influence for 9 districts it didn't know existed a year ago.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 21:26:22	These are old districts no longer active.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 21:26:50	...previously lost in the sands of Shasta County history. Lopez says ultimate intent would be to dissolve them. This is a first step.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 21:29:23	Bam. LAFCO approves a 0 SOI for all 9 districts with a single vote.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2014-12-18 21:37:35	This LAFCO meeting is over. Commission decides to move Feb. meeting to Feb. 12 to accomodate Sierra Logging Conference.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:14:05	This ShastaCo supervisors is well underway. Sorry for the delay. My Twitter app decided to stop working this morning.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:14:44	About 40 people here today. As first order of biz supervisors named new chairman for 2015... *drum roll*
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:15:13	Leonard Moty has been named Chairman of ShastaCo BOS. Pam Goacomini will serve as vice chair.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:17:02	Miller has worked for the SC probation department since 1988.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:17:16	As first matter as chair, Moty presents Ed Miller with employee of the year plaque. http://t.co/JENtfpQHP0

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:21:24	Public comment period now open.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:22:48	Maggie Fair with the California United Healthcare Workers speaking now. Says county is trying to suspend overtime pay for those workers.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:23:11	The CUHW has been in negotiations with county over past several weeks.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:23:39	CUHW workers are seeking a pay increase, but now worry they may lose overtime pay.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:25:28	Randall Faulkner now up. Says the crime rate in Redding area is a problem.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:26:13	Faulkner says sheriff and other officials routinely ignore white collar crimes "committed by your friends"
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:28:50	Millie Martinez up now. Also with CUHW Union. "We are very disappointed in the suspension of overtime pay"
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:30:17	Martinez says many fast workers now make more than CUHW caregivers make.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:31:24	Martinez: "please consider our request to increase our minimum wages"
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:32:15	Shirley (missed last name) with CUHW now up. Also asks supervisors to consider giving a raise. Overtime suspension hurts.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:39:32	Bam. Supervisors vote unanimously to send letters to Lassen MF about both Eiler and Bald fire plans.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:43:24	Another letter would take issue with state grazing project. Giacomini moves approval.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:44:00	Kehoe asks if letter has been removed by local grazing committee. Lees says no because of tight timeline. Kehoe says he supports letter but
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:44:39	The point of having grazing committee is to review things like this. Giacomini says she has talked with some members, including her husband.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-06 17:47:24	Grazing letter passes unanimously. One to go.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-08 17:21:07	Dick Fyten recaps LAFCO expenses over past yr, agency went over budget by $17k. That's because of increased workload and costs, he says.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-08 17:22:07	Fyten figures LAFCO workload in 2015 should be about 65% of 2014 workload. Projected budget surplus would cover 2014 overage, he says.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-01-08 17:23:05	That's provided LAFCO renews Lopez's contract for another year at proposed rate (think its $65/hr if I heard right).

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 16:51:51	Sorry. That should have been spelled Mickelson-Beadle.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 16:58:46	A number of local govt officials at today's LAFCO meeting, including county CEO andPublic Works head, Anderson mayor and city manager...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 16:59:44	...Shasta County Cal Fire officials, most folks on the Jones Valley water district board and others.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:03:53	There's the gavel. This Shasta LAFCO meeting has started. Commissioners Les Baugh, Pan Giacomini and Brent Weaver are absent today.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:04:04	Those absent have alternatives sitting in for them.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:05:41	First thing, commish David Kehoe asks if this meeting is legal under Brown Act since meeting location was changed after initial notice.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:07:49	Counsel Jim Underwood defers to LAFCO CEO Jan Lopez about notice timing, which should be done 24 hrs in advance. http://t.co/GM6KbayviB
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:09:48	Lopez says notice was posted and changes made in timely fashion. Meeting is legal, she says.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:10:25	Kehoe says there is a difference of fact, but says he'll continue if Underwood concurs its a legal meeting.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:10:50	Underwood says he hasn't confirmed beyond what he has been told.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:12:21	Lopez says 98% of people got the correct meeting notice, but apologizes for the confusion.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:16:27	Commissioners vote to move forward with this meeting 5-1, with Kehoe dissenting.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:16:52	Public comment period now open. Numerous folks have signed up to speak.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:18:18	Former director Amy Mickelson-beadle up first. Says she received an inappropriate tax document from LAFCO for 2014.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:18:52	Mickelson says that W9 covers amount of money involved in pending lawsuit.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:20:29	Mickelson says some commissioners have said she was terminated, which isn't true and is a breach of their agreement.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:21:38	Jacob Swindle now up, via cell phone. He sent cease and desist to Baugh last month over comments made to Linda Romig.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:22:12	Swindle takes issue with Facebook post from Baugh that called him "just a kid"
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:24:11	Jerry Monath up now. He's from Fall River Valley CSD. They settled a legal dispute with LAFCO last year.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:24:46	Monath said he came to speak because Jan Lopez's evaluation is on agenda. Says she is a true professional.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:26:16	Eedy Balser (so) of Cassel says Jan Lopez is using her influence at LAFCO to forward long-term plans for area she developed as consultant.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:29:11	Anderson City Manager Jeff Kiser now up. He thanks LAFCO for helping finalize the city's annexation, which went through this week.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:29:41	"We are celebrating in Anderson," Kiser says. That wraps public comment period.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:31:13	3 times pulled from consent: 5b1, 5b3, 5b7.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:31:45	*3 items. Autocorrect got me.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:32:28	Mickelson asks another item be pulled for discussion, 5a3, which covers minutes from Jan 8 meeting.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:33:13	Commissioner Dick Fyten now presenting on extraordinary expenses from past year. LAFCO did a lot more an normal that year.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:33:58	In other news, Baugh recently resigned from his post on LAFCO's fiscal committee. I was going to ask him why today, but he's not here.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:57:46	To sum up, LAFCO stayed within budget despite a huge workload this fiscal year...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 17:58:33	... But the agency may ask the county for a short-term low to cover operating costs due to cash shortage.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:02:09	Mickelson is asking her comments at Jan 8 meeting be included in minutes. Lopez says they are usually, but Mickelson says they weren't.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:04:47	Mickelson says some expenses for travel expenses are in violation of Jan Lopez's contract. Also says some of the numbers don't add up.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:05:54	Commission voted 5-1 to pass pulled consent calendar items. Kehoe dissents.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:06:25	Kehoe says he believes all commissioners should be present for such an important vote and worries about financial health of agency.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:06:45	Kehoe says he is also concerned at some observations just brought up by Mickelson.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:09:58	Moving on to public hearings. Fire districts merger up first.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:10:27	If passed, this item would combine the McArthur and NW Lassen Fire districts into one.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:20:06	Lopez says a lot of talk and planning has gone into prepping updated boundaries for the merger and she doesn't think it with impact Cal Fire
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:20:38	Public comment, Jerry Monath says he's in favor of the merger.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:25:34	Shasta County Cal Fire Deputy Chief Bret Gouvea now up. Says his agency can't support any changes that doesn't improve levels of service.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:26:06	Gouvea notes multiple agencies already respond to fires in that east county area based on mutual aid agreements.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:26:32	Kehoe asks specifically: does Shasta County Cal Fire support these changes. Gouvea says no.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:27:12	Gene Rogers (sp), a volunteer firefighter at nearby Cal Fire Soldier Mountain station, now up.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:33:23	Greg Myer (sp), fire chief at Soldier Mnt, is up now.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:34:24	Myer and Rogers both oppose the merger/change in sphere of influence for the fire districts.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:35:41	Myer says part of concern is proposed map could clear way for the new, merged fire district to eventually annex part of their coverage area
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:40:24	Joe Bruce, director of a fire department (he didn't say which one, but one we're talking about I guess) up now.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:44:11	This is most recent map for proposed fire district merger. Pink=primary areas, dots=sphere where they can respond http://t.co/eZv3zRH6vD
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:44:44	We'll that may be an over simplified explanation, but that's at core of the issue.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:45:51	Burt Cathy (sp) with NW Lassen Fire District now up. Says he doesn't understand what cal fire is afraid of. Says they have no plan to annex.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:46:55	Cathy just laid it out: sphere is response area but not full area. Many FDs respond to bigger areas under mutual aid agreements.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 18:51:10	Don Stanberg (sp), with Soldier Mnt, now up. Says recent meeting to find middle ground for districts didn't include any compromise.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 19:04:18	Public comment period now closed on fire district merger. Commission now discussing.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 19:22:00	Brenda Haynes notes this is an update tot the sphere of influence, not an annexation that would have to be voted on by people affected.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 19:22:17	Haynes says she supports the map, merger plans.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 19:25:09	Commissioner Farr says he supports Shasta County Fire's map and not LAFCOs.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 19:25:46	Kehoe says he is concerned about the process. Says comments should be accompanied by a motion... Moves not to accept second recommendation.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 19:25:54	Here comes the vote...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-17 16:30:50	A bogus 911 call led to an hours-long standoff with police in Red Bluff yesterday http://t.co/cSbZIAdvWz via @ashulman_RS
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 19:28:12	Fyten says he doesn't understand why Cal Fire opposes the plans. Says he can't back motion.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 19:30:27	After months of comment, map drawing and discussion, LAFCO votes 3-3 on motion to not accept merger... 1 commish absent.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 19:30:50	LAFCO commissioners are now trying to figure out what's next.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-19 19:31:39	Legally an updated sphere needs to be approved for this district to complete terms of a class action lawsuit against LAFCO.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 16:59:40	About 50 people have turned out for today's #shastagov supervisors meeting. http://t.co/pkzwecRUl7
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:02:15	And there's the gavel. This Shasta County Board of Supervisors meeting has started.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:03:26	Ann Stow to be honored upon her retirement after 27 years (!) with Shasta County. She directs Juvenile Division. http://t.co/yZBy872oWd
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:07:23	Shasta County Probation Chief Tracie Neal honors Ann Stow upon her retirement after 27 years of service.  http://t.co/NbAPH44sDw
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:12:01	Supervisors will now consider naming March 1-7 'Weights and Measures Week' in Shasta County.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:17:31	And a unanimous vote approves it. The first week of March will be Weights and Measures Week in Shasta County.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:19:24	Up next: a presentation on Rock Creek Road, which recently earned the county a citation from the Dept of Fish and Wildlife due to runoff.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:19:59	Public Works head Pat Minturn now presenting. Here's a map of area, near Shingletown. http://t.co/QhQZbPRcgD
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:23:12	Sediment has been washing over Rock Creek Road and into Battle Creek Watershed. 2012 Ponderosa Fire exacerbated the problem, Minturn says.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:23:28	The county and local property owners have already spent $1 mill+ to try and fix issue, but still a problem.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:27:38	Minturn is proposing a closure of Rock Creek Road during the winter months to help control erosion and trespassing concerns.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:27:49	Road would still be open to locals that need access, he says.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:28:47	Minturn says the county will spend at least another $100,000 making road improvements to help address runoff issues.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:29:36	Supervisor Baugh says he spent about a day touring Rock Creek Road. Had to clear a number of trees but only saw 1 vehicle.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:31:53	Baugh says he may support permanent closure of parts of Rock Creek Road if analysis supports that decision. Sparsely used.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:32:20	Supervisor Schappell asks how the county is being held responsible for an actor nature?
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:32:58	Minturn says the road does play a small role, and a small volume of road debris is going into stream.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:35:02	Board chair Moty says he favors working withy property owners and looking j to temp closures. No official action taken today.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:38:37	Rick Simon now up to present on marijuana enforcement plans.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:44:50	Simon says it has been a learning curve since Shasta county first introduced marijuana growing regulations in 2012.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:45:14	Since them code enforcement and other county departments have been working to streamline and improve the nuisance abatement process.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:50:11	Simon says his department has become more efficient over the last couple of years, cutting process time and improving success rate...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:50:33	...for marijuana grows in violation of county regulations.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:54:41	Simon says building department has already seen an increase in applications for buildings that would comply with new indoor mj grow rules.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:58:28	Simon wrapping up. Says process has been honed and hopes to have better enforcement numbers this year.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:58:57	Schappell says he has heard more folks moving their grows to Trinity County because of outdoor ban.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 17:59:40	Supervisor Giacomini says she has heard the same from Lassen county folks, more mj grows moving that way too.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:01:22	Baugh: "we are closed for business in terms of outdoor grows"
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:03:53	Simon says he expects to have increased success policing mj grows this year, but says keeping eye on indoor grows will likely be a challenge
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:07:10	Giacomini wonders if ban may be forcing more grows onto public lands. Simon says they're already seeing some of that.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:07:57	Simon: "it's very conceivable that some of those - especially larger grows - might migrate back to public lands"
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:09:37	Moty says the federal government has a lot more resources to deal with illegal grows than Shasta County does.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:11:19	Sheriff Bosenko at mic now. Will talk about SCSO needs for enforcement.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:12:39	Bosenko says he need more deputies. The department is already stretched thin.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:13:08	Bosenko points to Butte County, where they just hired 6 new code enforcement officers to enforce similar ban.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:16:24	Baugh says he'd like to see the board take action to find $$ to hire additional help during grow season.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:18:41	County CEO Larry Lees says he think temp help is a good option, but the money would have to come from something else.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:21:19	Lees notes the ordinance only bans outdoor marijuana grows in unincorporated areas of the county, some incorporated cities here still allow.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:23:55	Baugh and Kehoe say they're for trying to find $50,000 or more to fund temporary enforcement help.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:24:34	I'm sorry. That last tweet should have said Baugh and Moty support, but Kehoe is now also voicing his support for the needed resources.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:27:09	Moty says he'd like county staff to come back with a plan showing what they need and how much it would costs.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:28:20	Marijuana presentation wraps up. No official action. Public comment now open.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:32:29	Russ Wade of Mnt Gate up fist. Says he is against the proposed Moody Flats quarry in that area.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:33:14	On to consent calendar. 31 items on today's list.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:39:08	Supervisors are now recounting what they have done since last meeting. Up next: mid-year budget report.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:51:25	County Fiscal Chief Bebe Palin now presenting mid-year update on county budget.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 18:54:17	Overall the numbers look good, Palin says. County more or less in line with its ~$400 million budget.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 19:17:44	Palin says 71% of the counties discretionary general funds go to support public safety.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 19:26:36	Moty says he has looked at the prospect of reopening the shuttered jail annex in Redding and the numbers don't make sense.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-24 19:26:36	Supervisors approve mid-year budget report. For me this meeting is over.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 21:59:50	A green Chevrolet car merged into fast lane, clipping gray sedan and causing it to roll, he said.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:00:26	SB I5 near Lake Blvd should be completely reopened by 2:30pm or so, Montgomery said. I'm heading on to city council meeting.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:47:01	1 = very high priority, 4 = low priority.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:56:57	2. Find money to keep code enforcement beefed up following initially six-month plan. $125,000+ depending on plan. http://t.co/M0revbV6MH
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:59:38	4. This government speak about being fiscally responsible for healthcare offered to city of Redding retirees. http://t.co/NpbVZ5yopi

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:17:20	13. Redding has had a storm drain utility since 1993 but never a master plan for it. Should it develop one? http://t.co/cNnfZmepq3
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:18:02	Don't worry, y'all. Only 2 more to go then you can tweet me your favorites...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:19:14	14. Work on the streets, or at least do more so city isn't falling further behind on needed repairs. http://t.co/iyk3w21XUE
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:21:32	15. Last one. The city of Redding has about $200 million in unfunded pension liabilities. http://t.co/BEncLB5D6D
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:22:49	So what say you Twitterverse? What should be Redding's top priority from that list of 15?
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:26:28	Alright. Here we go. Councilors are getting ready to start discussing and penning down priorities.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:27:36	Alan Cost (sp) speaking now during public comment period. Says we shouldn't neglect trails simply b/c we don't have enough police officers.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:27:55	Cost notes money comes from different pots, and some may be available for transit that isn't for cops.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:28:21	Cost: please give fair consideration to the active transportation plan.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:29:32	Brent Weaver says he'd like to see the impact top ranked priorities would have on city reserves following today's tally.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:31:33	Kristen Schreider says she may rank some projects high if they have lower costs and are already part of city biz that needs to happen.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:33:32	Active transportation plan up first. Missy McArthur says she gives it a 2. Weaver does the same.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:34:17	Gary Caad lays down a 4, saying no general funds should go to it but grants or outside money could.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:34:57	Schreider gives it a 2. Sullivan goes for a 1.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:35:47	On code enforcement, McArthur gives a 1 for a 6-month extension to fund position. Sullivan concurs, also gives a 1.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:36:40	Transit plan earned 11 points total. I'm going to try and track this like a scoreboard/baseball game. Any pointers, @tjholmes_RS? LOL
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:38:26	Weaver also gives code enforcement a 1. Caad goes for a 2. Schreider also offers a 1, but says she's for $285k annually to fund FT position.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:39:28	Wow. Code enforcement just earned fours 1s and a 2. Going to be tough to beat, but public safety is up next.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:40:00	Specifically, the COPS grant is being discussed now. 1s across the board. Next.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:40:53	4. Is GASB 45, which deals with healthcare for city retirees.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:50:55	Here's the scoreboard so far: http://t.co/Ot0s1p9Bib
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:51:14	Weaver says any short term public safety measures should have a clear end for financing.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:54:00	1s across the board for short term public safety solutions.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:57:48	Caad says the city needs to work on public safety now and keep convo going about long-term fixes.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:59:39	On REU oversight meetings, Sullivan says she doesn't want to just have meetings for the sake of getting info.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:11:33	Now: ranking need/funding for existing school resource officer at Oasis Comm School.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:14:10	Ok. Made it to Redding City Council meeting in time to catch some of mid-year budget presentation. About 50 people here.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:28:34	"Mr. Kirk" speaking during public comment. Says he'd rather see money allocated to parks and trails go to police.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:29:09	Kirk says he uses and loves trails, but when you call 911 and an officer doesn't arrive, that's a higher priority.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:30:26	Mayor Francie Sullivan notes the city has never run a deficit, as Mr. Kirk said during speech. Kurt Starman says they plan to grow reserves.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:31:18	Missy McArthur moves to accept midyear budget, which increases appropriations by $545,630 to cover extra expenses.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:31:30	Budget measure passes unanimously.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:37:53	City Manager Kurt Starman says local economy has stabilized but growth is slow, hasn't returned to pre-recession levels.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:41:46	Starman says 13 RPD and 9 RFD positions are funded by grants set to expire. Would cost city $1.4 mill annually to keep all of them on staff.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:02:12	Missy McArthur says she didn't introduce the massage parlor related its, as Starman just said. Councilors vote to take it off list.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:03:33	6. An update to the Oasis Road Specific Plan to make sure city is using related finds effectively. http://t.co/Zs0NVQxwQk
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:04:09	Starman also notes that redoing the EIR for Oasis Road would be involved, which could open a can of worms.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:11:19	City would also be looking to apply to other grants to keep those positions on staff. It has reapplied for same grant but there may be a gap
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:13:20	11. SCOE can no longer help pay 1/2 costs for resource officer at Oasis Community School. Should Redding cover $? http://t.co/5Ej0ZW3Onw
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:14:22	... But should Redding find that position to keep it on at RPD????

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:13:23	Caad gives a 4 for resource officer since it's unclear if Oasis Community School will stay open.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:17:18	Starman notes that even if school closes that position could be redirected to patrol if money is there to fund it.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:18:27	Resource officer earned 10 points overall, the first pub safety related topic to fall to double digits.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:19:20	Weaver gives plans to enlist volunteers to help run Redding social media a 2. Says it's important to connect on those channels.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:20:57	Weaver says he likes the idea of starting with Instagram because interaction is limited. Would help establish good model and practices.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:22:38	Sullivan: "I've never even seen Instagram." Asks if training might be available. Cc: @530MediaProject
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:23:31	Wow. Social media earns all 2s and one 3 from the council. One upshot? It's free.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:24:42	McArthur goes for a 1 on storm drain master plan. Says it may save city money when it comes to flooding.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:26:29	Storm drain master plan earns 1s from all except Caad, who hands out a 3.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:27:41	Calls for a storm drain master plan beats out keep resource officer by 3 points.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:31:36	Street repairs hears some debate. Caad gives it a 3 because of $ issues, but says it deserves a 1.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:32:03	Sullivan says he city has money, but the challenge is deciding where to spend it, thus priority setting.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:32:50	Caad gives pension liability a 1, says he wants to pay it up soon as possible, would save $ in long run.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:33:33	Sullivan dishes out a 4, says CalPers payments are paying it down and for now that's enough for her.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:37:32	Finally tally is in. Starman says he'll sick some dollar amounts to a few of these &amp; bring it back to council soon. http://t.co/7pdSmbwu7o

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 21:53:22	Wrong place at the wrong time. I was heading to Redding City Council meeting and stumbled on the wreck.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:43:08	Starman encourages councilors to be stingy withe their "1" votes during priority workshop.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:43:41	Sullivan says the process is pretty painful. Most all of these topics/projects are important or wouldn't be on list.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:46:17	Ok, we're get to priorities now. Starman will recap Courtney projects and initiatives before councilors rate them each 1-4.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 22:59:53	*funding
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:10:44	10. Keep funding 9 Redding Fire Department positions after grant funds run out in August. Would cost a/b $817,000 yr http://t.co/C4tv6z20L5
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-25 23:13:45	Starman says Oasis Comm School is likely to close next year, so wouldn't need a resource officer.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:02:08	REU meeting idea earns 3s and 4s from all councilors.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:02:33	Weaver says he'd like to see Kids Kingdom fixed up, but city has higher priorities right now.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:02:49	Caad says he'd like to see a grant to cover renovation costs.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:04:07	Sullivan gives Kids Kingdom renovation a 2 because "we need to have balance in our community."
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:06:04	Here's the scoreboard. Moving on to SAFER grant. http://t.co/2VojVzJEni
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:07:11	As this meeting drags on fewer and fewer folks are sticking around. Started with about 50 in attendance, down to about 30 now.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-02-26 00:08:23	Sullivan: "I'm giving it a 1 and I hope you join me, and if we can hire more firefighters in the future even better."

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-01 01:05:05	I'm heading out to rollover crash on Keswick Dam Rd. involving off-duty RPD officer. Unclear if officer is the one trapped. Standby.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-01 01:13:29	Keswick Dam Rd. Is closed at Lake Blvd. I don't know how far down the crash is but I'm walking towards it.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-01 01:16:22	A couple of CHP cruisers just flew past me. Couple folks living on Keswick Dam Rd say the crash is a ways soun of Lake Blvd.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-01 01:24:29	There are about a dozen cop cars on scene, plus fire, tow and EMS http://t.co/YlCU7y97G7
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-01 01:24:54	CHP officers tells me the peeps trapped has been freed, but still a pretty chaotic scene.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-01 01:25:29	Truck is on it's side wedged between 2 trees. I'll try to find out more.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-01 01:33:33	Witnesses say the man was conscious when he was freed from the wreck. He's heading to Mercy Medical.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-01 01:34:37	Redding Fire Division Chief Don Lacy said it was definitely a traumatic injury but unsure of the extent.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-01 01:37:29	Keswick Dam Road is completely shutdown about a mile south of Lake Blvd.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-01 01:45:55	CHP Sgt. Ron Farris says injuries appear minor to moderate. 1 person involved, alcohol appears to be a factor.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-01 01:46:17	Farris says he heard reports the accident involved an off-duty RPD officer but could not confirm that.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-01 01:46:32	I am heading back to the office. More updates on http://t.co/EVkKN2vMmt soon.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:38:40	Baugh: how long will it take to hire additional deputies and code enforcement? Lees says it takes a year to get a FT deputy on board, but...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:39:05	...but part-time help could come much quicker (in time for this marijuana grow season).
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:41:40	Baugh notes if original ordinance banning outdoor mj grows wasn't put on ballot this conversation would have happened more than a year ago.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:41:54	Supervisors originally approved ban on Jan 2014.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:42:33	Baugh asks Lees if these resources will be enough. Lees says he doesn't know because there's no telling what challenges they'll face.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:44:05	Supervisor David Kehoe says a majority of voters approved Measure A, and there's an obligation by the county to provide necessary resources
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:44:58	But Kehoe says thee should be some performance standard put in place to gauge effectiveness, ROI on dollars spent.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:48:31	Kehoe asks County Counsel Rubin Cruse what sort of financial penalties those in violation face? $1,000 a day per violation, Cruse says.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:49:10	Abatement hearing officers have the ability to waive that. Moty asks how much in fees were collected last year.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:49:46	David Yorton says fees average $5,000-$30,000 in 2014, plus applicable attorney fees.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:50:09	Moty wonders how much of those fees were actually collected by the county. Yorton says he doesn't know off hand.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:52:18	Kehoe asks sheriff Bosenko if there is a priority of enforcement... I'm no sure I know what that means.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:52:40	Bosenko says he doesn't have enough staff to enforce the ordinance county wide.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:53:08	Kehoe says he hopes they don't ignore smaller mj grows. Bosenko says the department will still have to prioritize.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:53:37	An mj garden with 3 plants is going to be lower on that list than a garden with 100 plants.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:54:34	Bosenko says information shows many rural growers don't think ordinance will affect them since county can't enforce.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:55:50	Kehoe tells Lees he'd like to see something on how mj grows/raids are prioritized and who is making those calls.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:56:13	Bill Schappell says he agrees that heroin is a big issue in the community, also marijuana.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:57:03	Schappell says the state is the keeper of the money, and it's not really generous.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:58:08	Schappell says not only is the sheriff's office understaffed, but so is RPD and CHP. Blames the state.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 17:59:50	Schappell says making a violation a misdemeanor + financial penalties should deter some folks from growing.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:01:21	Pam Gaicomini asks if the additional code enforcement officer would be full time? Lees says they'd be temporary help.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:02:19	Leonard Moty says he agrees there should be a focus on heroin and meth. Says sheriff is on a task force and that's a separate issue.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:02:51	Moty: "That has not fallen off the radar ... There are just many pieces to the puzzle"
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:03:38	Moty asks who is responsible for enforcement of the ordinance. Lees says since its a land use issue its Resource Management.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:08:14	Moty says county also has to consider the new jail opening. Says costs projects to run annually have gone up from $2.5 to $3 million.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:08:55	Bosenko says the department currently has 5 openings for deputies, but those are all 'in the pipeline' to be filled.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:09:31	Bosenko says it's tougher to fill correctional officer openings, but doesn't know off hand how many vacancies.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:09:50	Moty says he foresees a lot of needs for the sheriff's office in the future.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:10:03	Lees says this money would come from the general fund.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:11:10	Kehoe asks if count could hire the part-time enforcement help as contract employees? Lees says yes but thee could be issues.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:15:22	Baugh says he supports committing additional resources for policing mj grows, but worries the proposal isn't enough.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:16:44	Baugh says he is getting a lot of calls from his district about mj grows that have been taken out but not cleaned up.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:17:11	Baugh: "I believe we are not quite keeping up now and the growing season hasn't even started."
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:18:03	Moty says he thinks the proposal for 2 PT deputies and another PT code enforcement officer should be enough.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:18:30	Moty notes that water quality control board is working on mj issues this year and should be a help.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:19:43	Kehoe asks if county has flexibility to make adjustments mid-year if needed. Lees says yes.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:20:34	Lees notes again that the mj ordinance only covers unincorporated areas of Shasta County.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:21:13	That's it. Presentation wraps up without any action. County staff can bri back proposal as action item in the future.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:21:41	General public comment period now open. Steve Boys of Jones Valley up first.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:22:52	Sorry, Steve *Boyd. Says the Jones Valley water dist, CSA #6, needs county's help 2 address issues that would lead to increased water rates.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-03 18:52:08	The ordinance is designed to help homes establish 100 feet of defensible space even if it goes over property lines.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-12 21:19:35	Simon: "The local wine industry is concerned that current regulations are difficult to understand and cumbersome to navigate."

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-12 21:39:09	Parham notes wines can be made from other ag products besides grapes, so what about those?
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-12 21:40:14	Simon said they discussed including other fruits used for wine making, but issue at hand was updating current ord which just covers grapes.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-18 02:23:37	Councilor Pam Morgan says "we're not Anderson" and says she thinks they should approve.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-18 02:25:01	Duckett is proposing reducing most impact fees by 50%.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-18 02:52:16	Alternatively councilors may chose to pay $7500 for an evaluation laying out costs to remodel current city hall buildings.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-18 02:54:12	City could cover bulk of costs to build new city hall and comm center but would need loans/bonds to cover $1.7 million.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-18 03:07:41	Head of two of the affected nonprofits say they support the idea of relocating, building new city hall and comm center.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-18 03:09:25	Farr asks if $7500 would be enough to evaluation of existing building. City staffer says yes, they've talked with a firm.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-18 03:09:48	Says work on existing city hall building would be more like a rebuild than a rehab.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-18 03:32:27	... Will also consider doing eval on existing building during a future meet. Duckett says staff will hold off on new city hall til then.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:25:27	It's beginning to look a lot like spring around Redding these days. I didn't realize we even had a winter... http://t.co/uuZIs3PJOf
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:26:49	Two public hearings on today's agenda. Up first is one from Public Works. Here are text of both: http://t.co/HdR78oBoeh

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:28:38	R5: zoning amendment in Cottonwood (see previous tweet for full text).

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:31:47	Sheriff Bosenko coming up now to talk Sheriff's Office staffing. He'd like $910k to hire 5 new deputies + 2 service officers.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:33:16	Sheriff Tom Bosenko starts by highlighting cuts in 09-10 fiscal year = 11 layoffs and the elimination of 26 positions.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:33:34	15 sheriff's positions were also axed in 2005, Bosenko says.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:34:02	Says attrition, recruitment and retention have been issues for the department.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:35:22	Here are some stats Bosenko is showing: http://t.co/9cxgLtJ7Yl
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:36:08	Bosenko says there has  been an increase in crime on recent years, partly due to Prop 47 and AB 109.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:37:02	Bosenko hopes to reopen the Burney substation this year, which would allow services for east county folks w/o 2-3 hr round trip to Reddinng.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:37:40	Bosenko says from 3-7am no deputies are on patrol in eastern Shasta County. They respond to emergencies from home.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:37:55	"Of course the criminals know," Bosenko says.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:39:21	Bosenko says 4 ppl currently in hiring process to be deputies would like to be based in Burney.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:40:26	Bosenko said there used to be resident deputies in French Gulch and Platina/Igo/Ono areas, but those have been cut.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:40:39	3 deputies used to cover Lakehead. Now there's 1.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:41:17	More stats: http://t.co/sbayGZXOYi
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:41:38	Bosenko says attrition is due to retirement and deputies leaving for better pay/benefit packages at other agencies, some local.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:43:14	Bosenko says in 2014 there were 810 applications for jobs and the SCSO successfully hired 13... Success rate of 1.6%
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:43:55	Bosenko says some applicants don't show for tests, others have failed drug tests for pot, prescription meds and hard drugs.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:44:58	Bosenko says nation-wide criticism of law enforcement could factor into issues of hiring qualified deputies.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:46:00	Bosenko: DOJ recommends 1.8 officers per 1,000 people. There's about 76k people living in uninc ShastaCo, so needs 136 deputies. Has 84.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:46:07	Of those 84 positions, 59 are currently filled.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:47:55	Orange on blue is hard to read, but here's a timeline of sheriff's cutbacks/closures since 1992: http://t.co/JdoCSqM9c6
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:49:31	Hard-to-read timeline stats continued: http://t.co/0HON0Mv7Hj
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:52:08	Bosenko says jail culture is turning to prison culture with more long-term offenders sentenced under AB109. Inmate assaults are up, he says.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:53:26	Bosenko says there's a need for another jail to house pre-trial offenders, which make up majority of current jail population.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:54:32	In 2004 there were 270 total positions at Sheriff's office, but that was reduced to under 240 in 2009-10 due to cuts, Bosenko says.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:55:30	Calls for service since 2000: http://t.co/n6eBNYMKL1
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:56:44	"This is probably the most concerning graph," Bosenko says. Population up, # of deputies down by comparison: http://t.co/tenuVDdnBg
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-18 16:02:16	Shasta Lake councilors back plans for new city hall, community center ($) http://t.co/SZlOTkUsTP http://t.co/N5JCnmK5Nk
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:57:05	$910,000 would also pay for 2 new vehicles in addition to 5 deputies, 2 service officers.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:57:42	Bosenko wraps up presentation. Now supervisors can ask questions, discuss.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:58:05	"None of these things are inexpensive," Bosenko notes.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 16:58:19	Count CEO Larry Lees to offer a few words/insights.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:01:17	Lees says Sheriff's Department was allocated $40.8 million this fiscal year, the highest amount ever. "But it's never enough"
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:02:04	Lees notes costs continue to rise.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:06:21	Lees: "with all that said I support the sheriff's recommendation" for an additional $910,000.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:06:53	Lees says he'd like to work with fiscal officer to provide additional money until those positions are filled, then transfer it over.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:07:32	"With all the things we've been talking about, this has to be it," Lees says. "It is going to come from somewhere else."
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:09:35	Lees says he believes increased economic activity and sales tax revenue will help sustain the additional $910,000 in expenses.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:09:49	He's talking about revenue from existing sales tax, not a new one.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:11:40	Kehoe asks what the community would get for the $910k, a reduction in crime?
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:11:55	Bosenko says you can't control criminal intent, but that's the hope.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:12:24	Kehoe suggests setting a goal for crime reduction. Bosenko says that can be tough because there's some fluctuation in crime year to year.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:13:56	Kehoe to Lees: "where is the money coming from?" Lees says they'll look to revenue form sales tax. If that does pan out, well...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:15:53	Lees talking other funding obligations and constraints of spending more on public safety: http://t.co/kTkjHpebds
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:16:18	Les Baugh asks if the resources can be tied to a statistical reduction in crime. "What is gee next AB109 the stage of Ca pushes upon us?"
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:16:47	I've been trying to tweet that video for the last 15 minutes and it kept failing.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:17:35	Baugh says recent stats published in RS showing decrease in crime since 1990s aren't true. Those #s came straight from law enforcement...
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:19:30	Pam Giacomini: "are we going to be able to fill these positions?" Bosenko: (in short) yes.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:20:35	Bosenko says new "millennial" recruits look more at salary, benefits offered than older recruits did.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:22:07	Giacomini asks what areas are going to lose funding if Sheriff gets more $. Lees says that hasn't been determined yet.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:24:21	Bosenko says he could see being back in front of supervisors again next year looking at needs of department.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:26:11	@sethsteph67 oh I'm not saying crime was good back in the 90s. Stats just show fewer calls for service last year in Redding than late 90s.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:28:38	Lees says 75-80% of discretionary county funds go toward public safety (which isn't just sheriff's office).
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:33:18	Leonard Moty says county is in a delicate position. Also has to fund other departments, including mental health which relates to pub safety.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:38:42	Bosenko says initial costs to hire the 7 positions will be less than $910k b/c they're hired at lower wage and eventually step up.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:40:43	Baugh says he supports hiring additional deputies but county should also look to increase pay/benefits to stay competitive.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:41:26	Kehoe makes a motion to approve staff recommendation. Baugh seconds. Supervisors vote unanimously to allocate $910k to sheriff's office.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-17 17:42:24	Shasta Country supervisors vote unanimously to spend $910k to hire 5 new sheriff's deputies, 2 service officers.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-18 01:54:37	Details about costs of needed improvements to Flanagan substation: http://t.co/IQauSUgEyc

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-18 02:06:27	The building was originally built to house small businesses that could expand to larger offices in industrial park. Didn't really work out.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-18 02:08:05	Market value for the ~15,000 sq ft building is about $600,000. City could use that money toward new city hall, if council moves forward.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-24 16:03:24	And here we go. This #shastagov supervisors meeting has started.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-24 16:03:46	Supervisor Les Baugh is absent today.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-24 16:04:35	First up, will supervisors name April "child abuse prevention awareness month?" Probably, but let's wait and see for sure.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-24 16:07:31	A unanimous votes passes it. April will be "child abuse prevention awareness month" in Shasta County.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-03-24 16:08:06	April could also be "sexual assault awareness month" in Shasta County, which supervisors will vote on next.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-08 01:30:16	Knoll says if trails were named or marked it would have helped tell emergency crews how to get to their location.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-08 01:51:01	Kiser: "this only applies to city-hosted events," so folks can still drink their own brews in Anderson River Park.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-08 01:54:06	City is concerned current structure for alcohol sales at events may open city up to litigation.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-08 02:46:18	Maybe Moody Flats? That's the only one proposed in the county right now.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-08 02:46:46	A quick unanimous vote passes the motion. The city will now take steps to remove itself from that board.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-08 02:57:32	City Manager Jeff Kiser says stricter water standards aren't city's idea, but are standards mandated from the governor.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-08 03:01:40	Kiser said reducing water use by 25% would cost the city as much as $100k I. Lost revenue. But would reduce pumping costs by $30-35k.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-08 03:02:05	If approved stage 2 of water cutbacks would limit watering to 3 days a week.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-08 03:02:54	Kiser warns the council that city parks will be impacted this year. "It's not going to be the lush green fields you've seen in the past."

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 17:28:32	So much going on I can't keep up. A lady that said she is Jim Young's significant other says you has retired and isn't returning.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 17:31:30	County CEO Larry Lees says temp employees and others working overtime have been keeping VSO going.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 17:36:42	Lees says the county will honor people that just hose the retire or leave the VSO.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 17:39:49	Lees says he was excited to hear Dunlap would come back on an interim basis.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 17:42:00	Supervisor Kehoe asks county counsel Rubin Cruse to explain why personnel issues can't be talked about.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 17:42:32	Cruse says there is the right to privacy plus media reports says litigation may be in the pipeline, and they don't comment on pending cases.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 17:43:33	Moty: "veteran services are right up there with public safety. Vet services have always been a major concern and goal for this county"

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 17:56:41	Ok. Supervisors back in session. Water issue, drought update now up.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:00:30	Minturn: "Shasta Lake is all we've got and it's down 70 feet. It's going to drop fast."
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:01:29	This meeting started with a crowd of about 100 people, now down to about 12.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:07:27	Minturn says folks in county water district will pay a surcharge to cover costs of $62,500 in water purchased from McConnell.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:07:52	Minturn says expenditures are outpacing revenue from these small, rural water districts.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:08:22	Minturn says revenue has declined slightly as people conserve during the drought.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:11:10	@RJswanee so you work at the Shasta VSO?
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:12:06	@RJswanee sorry I meant to ask*do you work at Shasta VSO?

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:23:32	"It doesn't seem to be managed very well," Hunter says.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:30:36	Interesting stat: Minturn says half of all water customers in Shasta County get water from the city of Redding.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:33:27	Well, Boyd and Stead just walked out as Minturn was talking about water loss and leak detection in their district. Lot of history there.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:35:10	Baugh says it's ironic Boyd and Stead calls on Supervisors to listen, but get up and walk out when Supes start asking questions.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:38:47	Moty says he was also disappointed to see Boyd and Stead walk out.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:42:15	Supervisors pass stricter water restrictions, continue local drought emergency with unanimous vote.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:44:08	Wait. I misspoke. Tighter water restrictions are a separate agenda item being discussed now.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:45:58	Last item on the agenda, final vote on updated winery zoning changes.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:48:35	A number of folks spoke in favor of the updated standards for wineries at a previous meeting.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 18:54:17	The main change? Update would allow wineries on parcels as small as 2 acres, opposed to 5 acres under current standards.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-14 19:04:48	Lane McLain tells supervisors he like the new rules and looks forward to officially own a (small) winery recognized by the county.

1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-30 16:06:28	Underwood says there has been challenges with figuring out actual finances b/c there were some reporting issues under former EO Jan Lopez.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-30 16:07:54	LAFCO just picked up another commission. Brent Weaver walked in.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-30 16:10:34	In new internal controls, Underwood says use of debit cards has already been eliminated.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-30 16:11:11	An issue arose a few months ago when Lopez charged a couple thousand $ for local hotel stays in Redding &amp; Fall River Mills.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-30 16:11:31	She charged those expenses to a LAFCO debit card. Sorry if that wasn't clear.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-30 16:15:49	Underwood says it's mostly legal expenses being deferred until next year. He's fine with that, he says, b/c it's payments to his law firm.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-30 16:18:57	Underwood says LAFCO needs to appoint an interim executive officer to meet statutory obligations.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-30 16:19:13	Underwood says he can do it, or the office manager can, or maybe a commissioner.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-30 16:26:09	David Kehoe motions to approve cash-flow plan. Underwood asks who should be interim executive officer.
1881154128	ClayDuda_RS	2015-04-30 16:26:29	Kehoe says he he'd like to see underwood fill that role. Commission approves unanimously.
