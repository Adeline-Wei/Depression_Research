19368770	SiriusXMNHL	2015-04-30 16:33:01	Boomer lists off some surprising stats from the 1st round of the NHL playoffs
19368770	SiriusXMNHL	2015-04-30 16:36:38	In 47 first round games there was 234 goals scores (4.98gpg), games were a lot tighter compared to last years playoffs
19368770	SiriusXMNHL	2015-04-30 16:38:13	There was 2804 shots faced by 1st round goaltenders and 2587 were stopped for a .923 save % and 6 shutouts #YearOfTheGoalie
19368770	SiriusXMNHL	2015-04-30 16:39:33	10 of the 47 first round games went to overtime (21.3%), lower than the average of the regular season
19368770	SiriusXMNHL	2015-04-30 16:41:19	Scoring first does not mean a "sure win" as the team scoring first in the 1st round went 28-19
19368770	SiriusXMNHL	2015-04-30 16:42:14	If you can hold a lead going into the 3rd you have a better shot to take home the win, in the 1st round teams leading after 2 went 28-9
19368770	SiriusXMNHL	2015-04-30 16:43:18	"Home Ice" isn't as effective as it used to be...home team records were 27-20 only a 57.4% winning percentage
