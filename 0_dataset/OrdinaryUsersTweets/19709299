19709299	Alicia1985	2015-05-21 20:45:16	Alison King's dress is gorgeous! I want! She's always looks gorgeous 😍 #Corrie #SoapAwards #Stylish
19709299	Alicia1985	2015-05-21 20:48:13	It's obvious Eastenders are only winning because it's their 30th. There's no way Who Killed Lucy? was the best storyline. #SoapAwards
19709299	Alicia1985	2015-05-21 20:57:08	Why is that woman off Eastenders dressed like a quality street?! #SoapAwards
