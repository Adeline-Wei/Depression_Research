1976603018	cnazty15	2014-05-31 17:40:30	Stop telling girls how dress. 
Start telling people to respect them regardless of what they're wearing and how they look.

1976603018	cnazty15	2014-06-03 00:51:54	Once a relationship is over, leave, don't continue watering a dead flower.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-06-04 21:57:50	You ever write a really long message and about halfway through you're like, "You know what, they prob don't even care." and delete all of it
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-06-04 20:54:41	i don't have a lot of friends. I just know a lot of people.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-06-04 21:01:57	I hate when people say "It's a long story", Bitch, I'm bored lemme hear it.

1976603018	cnazty15	2014-06-06 20:17:57	my worst fear is getting cheated on/played while being loyal.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-06-06 20:18:15	If I learned one thing from video games, it is that when you meet enemies, it means you're going in the right direction.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-06-06 20:19:12	Sext: I'll share my weed with u, eat pizza with u, give u kisses, play video games with u, listen to music with u, and cuddle with u
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-06-06 20:45:59	all i'm doing today is staying in my bed all day listening to sad music, crying and sleeping
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-06-08 18:14:01	Idk why I keep getting sad over people that don’t give a shit about me.

1976603018	cnazty15	2014-07-02 22:34:32	my sleep schedule is so fucked up.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-07-02 22:34:56	summer is going by really fast and i have done nothing productive at all.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-07-02 22:50:21	pretty much.. http://t.co/asBtXiOztP
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-07-09 21:14:25	people who constantly tweet celebs to follow them or notice them, are my least favorite kind of people. like stop.

1976603018	cnazty15	2014-07-15 20:38:58	Nothing scars you more than the negative shit your own parents tell you.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-07-20 02:58:16	i fucked around and caught feelings..
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-07-22 23:58:55	I’m in love with the idea of you and me still together in the future.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-07-26 01:20:06	you're losing interest in me and it hurts to know that there is nothing i can do about it.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-07-26 02:31:09	take me back to when you'd reply faster and not take hours.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-07-30 03:37:03	@alelihpop awaw ilysm, you're gr8-er
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-08-01 22:05:36	in my opinion, "i love you", "love you", and "ily" each have different meanings.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-08-02 23:07:30	i get annoyed easily, especially by children.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-08-10 17:41:02	Thank to @Ayyooo_Lyssaa for helping me find my quince dress!!!
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-08-16 21:00:46	@Jellamae16 Happy Birthday, cutie! ☺️💕

1976603018	cnazty15	2014-08-23 18:11:34	i always joke about killing myself to hide the fact that i actually want to kill myself

1976603018	cnazty15	2014-09-03 02:59:45	i just want to be happy.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-09-03 03:02:50	i'm getting bad again, but i'm too tired to care.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-09-05 01:42:51	lmao, 
pretty ironic how Joan Rivers said Palestine people deserve to die, and look at her, dead.
oh, how karma works in mysterious ways.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-09-05 22:49:36	i will never change myself for someone.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-09-10 23:40:46	i don't know whether to keep trying to make things work or just give up.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-09-12 13:43:50	@alelihpop you never look ugly.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-09-18 21:55:27	if we dated and the relationship lasted less than four months, i do not even consider you as my ex.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-09-20 18:24:01	i got told that i look like "Letty" from The Fast And Furious movie..
Hmm..
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-09-21 02:45:25	"I have wanted to kill myself over a hundred times, but somehow I am still in love with life."

😂😂😂
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-09-30 00:04:58	it's sad how some people just simply do not care about their education.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-10-02 22:31:23	my anxiety ruins a lot of things for me.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-10-01 14:00:49	i hate having my hair up. 😩
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-10-01 23:21:30	sadly, i'm starting to become the ones who broke my heart.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-10-03 13:19:56	@speedyrivera82 suck mine, tf
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-10-08 22:43:02	I get along with guys a lot better than I do with girls.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-10-09 02:15:13	i flirt a lot.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-10-11 20:47:33	i wish i had perfect teeth 😩
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-10-12 01:32:42	it's like i'm too young to die but, old enough to choose a career i want to do for the rest of my life.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-10-12 19:09:46	putting on makeup is such a spiritual experience. i watch myself go from a 3 to atleast at 10, i love it.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-10-23 13:42:55	keep your negativity away from me.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-10-20 22:24:40	It's pretty sad how my parents care more about how I'm doing in school than my mental health.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-10-29 01:15:48	it's so annoying when people ask me about the things i post.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-10-31 01:52:16	i just wish that everyone would accept my decision, and stop trying to make me feel bad or give them an explaination.
especially you.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-11-01 02:35:39	i wish my parents would give me more freedom.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-11-13 23:20:42	one thing i recently noticed about myself, is that everytime i hug someone i always close my eyes.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-12-02 02:23:14	I want to be spoiled but I also feel extremely guilty when people use money on me.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-12-05 02:18:21	DON’T EVER FEEL BAD ABOUT SAYING NO.
YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE OPTION TO SAY NO.
YOU DO NOT OWE ANYONE A ‘YES’, OR AN EXPLAINATION.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-12-07 22:49:42	Taking naked pictures of yourself does not make you a bad person. People who share them without your permission are bad people.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-12-06 03:17:10	people keep telling me that i look like Letty from the Fast &amp; The Furious movies 😭
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-12-10 02:59:51	sometimes you just outgrow people, and that's okay.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-12-10 18:18:53	omg I hugged my friend and he took a misletoe out of his pocket and kissed my cheek.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-12-16 14:36:40	i have a love-hate relationship with JROTC
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-12-14 20:44:20	my mom said that she is growing out her eyebrows so she can get them done to look like mine 😂
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-12-18 21:37:56	It bothers me how some girls cover their cleavage in their pictures. Like, there is nothing wrong with showing some skin.
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-12-27 23:21:41	i'm a 'in the house' person, i hardly ever go out. 😩😂
1976603018	cnazty15	2014-12-25 02:05:58	one day you're all about me then the next you're distant, like make up your mind already, either you want me or you don't, damn.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-01-08 23:28:57	I want to be in a relationship, but at the same time I want to remain single as long as I can.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-01-08 23:31:31	My mistakes/decisions do not define who I am.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-01-11 22:08:55	@vomitspits wtf hella bandwagoning 😂😂
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-01-18 00:29:20	Things don't even hurt the same no more, I'm so numb to the pain.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-01-18 00:49:31	I joke about killing myself to hide the fact that I actually do want to die..
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-01-22 20:07:31	The hardest thing I learned, was that some people are better left in your past, no matter how bad you want them in your present.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-01-25 02:38:43	Gender doesn’t determine what you can and cannot enjoy, what you can and cannot look like or what you can and cannot do.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-01-28 01:52:43	It's crazy how busy I've gotten with JROTC, Soccer &amp; other school things, but I still manage to keep my grades up...
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-01-29 14:18:05	can i stay home from school please, i'm not mentally/emotionally okay right now.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-01-30 23:53:32	I’m literally so afraid to grow up, and go into adult life..
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-01-29 03:26:00	Whenever things are going good I somehow manage to always fuck everything up. I can never do anything right.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-01-29 03:26:06	I hate myself
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-02-07 21:43:00	All my friends ignore me and leave me out of things and it makes me sad..
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-02-10 02:40:52	I hate shopping so much.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-02-14 14:08:58	"Fuck school", I say as I do all my homework and aim for A’s &amp; B's..
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-02-15 06:52:33	@vomitspits I can't dance for shit, I hella suuck
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-02-15 06:55:02	@vomitspits I'm shy, me and dancing aren't a good mix haha
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-02-15 06:09:48	Military Ball wasn't as fun as I expected it to be. But I still had a good time..
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-02-22 02:38:12	@alelihpop sorta thinking of not going to six flags just so i can see this fight....
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-02-23 14:16:40	Don't invest your time &amp; energy on people. Invest on your education, career, yourself. Ya'know things that are permanent in your life..
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-02-24 05:03:27	Whatever happens, happens.
Life goes on.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-02-24 05:09:52	Sure, I may have made some stupid decisions/mistakes, but that's all apart life. You gotta go through stuff and learn from it.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-02-27 02:20:11	Man, someone took #15 so i had to get #8 😩
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-02-27 03:36:52	"Omg i got a busy life am sorry but i try and make as much time for u baby girl"
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-02-25 21:06:02	I hate presenting so much.

1976603018	cnazty15	2015-03-04 15:21:38	You do not need to feel obligated to sacrifice your own self for the sake of someone else all of the time.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-03-06 22:49:28	I just wish I had smooth, clear skin &amp; perfect teeth.

"Can I go out?"

1976603018	cnazty15	2015-03-09 02:12:22	I may want/like you a lot, but please don't ever think I need you.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-03-12 23:12:04	I'm so used to always being left out.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-03-14 05:49:55	I hate how I always fuck things up when things are going good.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-03-14 19:05:14	If a woman rejects you, have some pride and move on. You’re not everyone’s cup of tea, live with it.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-03-18 01:33:28	hey mom &amp; dad, even when I come home smelling like weed with bloodshot eyes, or dilated pupils, I love you, and none of it is your fault.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-03-22 16:41:02	Someone told me I could pass off as Egyptian?
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-03-20 21:42:54	If you're proud of your body and you want to show it off, then fucking do, fuck what anyone says.

1976603018	cnazty15	2015-04-04 23:21:02	I love myself, and I am finally happy with who I am.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-04-06 01:07:10	If there are people that are getting angry over the fact that you feel so good about yourself, you’re doing it right.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-04-07 01:10:14	@jellaisthename @alelihpop oh my god

1976603018	cnazty15	2015-04-14 18:33:28	"I can't insult you because I feel like it doesn't affect you whatsoever, so what would be the point of insulting you."
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-04-14 18:35:13	"There's something about you, it scares me."
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-04-14 03:04:48	@alelihpop This means a lot to me, thank you so much. Love you Alelih ❤️
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-04-23 22:20:51	I don’t chase people anymore. I learned that I’m here, and I’m important. I’m not going to run after people to prove that I matter.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-04-28 03:17:42	1 month and many more to come...
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-04-29 02:57:21	BLACK LIVES MATTER.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-04-29 04:37:15	I just wish you would try and make time for me, just like how I make time for you.

1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-02 21:41:09	He doesn't care about me He doesn't care about me He doesn't care about me He doesn't care about me He doesn't care about me He doesn't care
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-04 00:37:03	I don't deserve to keep being hurt over and over again by the same person.

1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-08 23:17:11	"What happened to your gangster raider fan look, now you look like a nerd."
- SFC Reyes, when he saw me wearing my glasses
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-09 02:03:17	"Do you know who my dad is"
"No"
"Tupac is my dad"
"You're white, he's black"
"I bleached myself"
"R.I.P My daddy"

1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-13 15:33:12	So I got ranked up to Corporal and they're having me do colorgaurd. 😅
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-12 22:16:08	You have trash friends if they don’t make sure you eat, like if I eat you eat whether I gotta pay for yours or we gotta share the plate.

1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-19 02:40:32	Don’t send pictures unless you want to. If you do take a picture, don’t include your face. Keep yourself safe.
#YourBodyYourChoice
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-19 02:42:53	If he makes you feel uncomftorable or insecure about any part of your body, leave him.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-19 23:35:15	It's sad how I have to take his phone away from him whenever we're together so he could pay attention to me..
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-21 17:27:04	The fact that my Digital Photo teacher said I did really great this year and that she wants me in Adavanced Photo next year, is great. 😭
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-21 17:36:31	IF ME AND MY BESTFRIEND DONT TALK FOR THE LONGEST THEY STILL MY BFF AND I'M STILL GONNA HIT THEM UP LIKE ITS NOTHING CAUSE THATS WHAT WE DO.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-21 17:37:03	"Honestly you were really happy at the beginning and then like when he started trying less that's when I noticed you started being unhappy."

1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-24 05:02:42	The Quince was amazing, so glad I got to be a part of it, but sad I had to leave early.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-23 03:23:39	😊

1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-24 18:34:22	Fave place to eat. ❤️ http://t.co/pnLCvwtzUw
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-24 21:18:22	Nothing saddens and scares me like the thought that I can become ugly to someone who once thought all the stars were in my eyes.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-25 02:30:56	Whatever you do, make sure you do it for you.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-25 03:08:25	Maybe I'm just too hard to love and easy to leave.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-28 00:24:54	My bf gets mad because apparently I "sleep too much."
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-30 03:30:10	I hope one day I can wake up and be glad I did.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-29 19:31:27	if you don’t provide access to or education about safe sex, people are still going to have sex, they’re just going to have unsafe sex.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-05-31 23:31:02	I was attempting to hop a fence and I was stuck and almost fell and my bf was on his phone..
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-06-02 01:49:32	The feeling I get after working-out is amazing, and it makes me feel soo good about myself. This is what I live for.

1976603018	cnazty15	2015-06-02 20:55:37	My current situation is not my final destination, I’ve survived a lot of things, and I’ll probably survive this.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-06-04 21:32:52	If you truly love someone accept their past and leave it there, don't keep bringing it up.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-06-04 02:02:41	I'm too pretty and amazing for you to be treating me like I'm nothing, fuck you.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-06-06 22:33:49	I hate the way you say you miss me and don't make efforts to see me.

1976603018	cnazty15	2015-06-15 22:31:50	I came to the decision that I'm going to try out Cross Country and see if I like it or not.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-06-15 22:43:01	@alelihpop I know!! I'm going too omg
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-06-16 03:05:20	So I didn't make it all the way because I became lightheaded and had to go home, but hey, atleast I tried it out.
1976603018	cnazty15	2015-06-18 03:07:11	I always fuck things up, I can never do anything right.
