20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-04 13:01:54	Eating a sandwich and trying to work out what the point of Twitter actually is!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-04 21:09:32	I'm loving my new phone
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-05 12:30:02	@claireangel and virtually healthy. Weightwatchers recommend them apparently! Or something like that.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-05 13:17:29	@davidlabbett don't worry, she'll help me get over it!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-05 13:52:16	Off to FrontPage training....
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-06 13:07:35	I'm also not sure there's any point going to Ikea if I have to go on my own. I'm no good at making important decisions.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-07 13:51:42	Been to the beach. Lovely and sunny but a bit chilly. Thinking about playing Mario Kart now.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-09 17:04:41	Off for food and drinks with some mates. Maybe a beer will cure my headache?!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-10 11:43:45	Had a great night out last night. Long journey home on a coach though. At least the trains were just about working this morning.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-12 12:37:04	I'm surprised there are no big queues at Ikea. Should have gone for meatballs after all.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-22 20:55:59	Had a great weekend but spent too much money in Snow and Rock. Stowe here I come - soon...
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-22 21:09:04	I'm watching Lost. Apparently tonight's episode is the best ever!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-04 21:50:48	l'm online on my new phone - genius. And l've worked out how to send a text message!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-05 13:09:06	Just had chicken korma, and I'm still hungry.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-06 13:03:55	I want to know if it's still snowing in Bournemouth.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-06 13:09:39	@davidlabbett No cancellations yet apparently. But what you see on the web site isn't always what happens in real life.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-06 16:38:43	Rubbish. The snow disappeared before I got home
20050557	alilabbett	2009-02-16 20:21:23	I absolutely love my new sofas. Better try not to spill my dinner on them ;-)
20050557	alilabbett	2009-03-06 13:04:25	I'm debating whether to go and spend some money or to save it for my holiday? Only 8 days to go!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-03-13 17:36:27	I'm on holiday! Well, nearly...
20050557	alilabbett	2009-03-14 09:34:54	We're off on our American adventure!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-03-14 14:13:08	finally on the plane after probably the most lengthy check-in ever!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-03-16 00:04:08	Off for a burger, i am in america after all!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-03-16 13:21:47	We're off to the slopes. It's another beautiful sunny day here!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-03-16 19:42:20	A great days skiing. Good to get the boots off tho and get some feeling back in my toes!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-03-17 12:32:40	Off for another sunny day of skiing. Cheap lift passes today because it's St Patrick's day!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-03-17 17:53:25	skiing done for the day. Off to Ye Olde England Inn now for lunch!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-03-17 20:54:07	i'm eating home made cookies and playing connect 4 while listening to jazz!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-03-22 14:33:30	This is more like it. Proper snow - 7 inches so far today and it's still falling.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-08 12:12:13	Yay. I really have!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-08 16:28:05	A rough looking stinky alcohol man has come and plonked himself next to me on the train. Nice.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-08 16:49:53	Ok, he was alright really. Shouldn't judge by appearance. Or smell.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-03-08 20:35:54	Less than 6 days to go!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-03-16 01:18:59	What a lovely burger that was! Off to bed now. This fresh mountain air is knackering.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-03-17 22:06:34	Mmmm free guinness!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-03-18 22:07:46	i'm watching Caddyshack cos american news is more depressing than our own shut up about AIG for 5 minutes!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-08 12:09:46	Now i think i've worked out the texting Twitter thing. Maybe.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-08 16:44:32	Now he's talking to me. Seems ok really but he's got dodgy teeth.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-14 16:38:45	wondering why twitter won't update on my mobile? I'm sure someone must have updated since 9 this morning.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-20 16:37:42	Got to stop blinking hard. Makes the back of my head hurt. Is that normal?
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-21 07:39:34	I'm very pleased the giant spider only decided to show itself once i got out the shower!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-22 07:27:56	Thank you to Dave for giving me a lift to the station just so I could eat a pain au chocolat.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-22 08:09:17	You don't 'give' someone a text, you 'send' them a text or you 'give' them a call. Simple.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-22 16:43:44	Why would you wear a baseball cap with a suit?
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-28 16:31:07	my head is spinning
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-30 16:38:12	I'm done for if the man on the train who won't stop coughing has swine flu.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-05-13 21:03:48	Should have been Debra
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-10 19:45:59	http://twitpic.com/346g1 - Star Wars show at the o2! Fantastic!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-14 16:45:36	Aha! Updating made it work.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-15 16:34:30	Going home to see my lovely new tv.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-20 16:28:29	it's a bit smelly on the train today. Hope it's not going to be smelly all summer.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-21 16:44:59	Train's not smelly tonight but they have been a bit over zealous with the air conditioning!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-22 16:31:52	I'm hungry. The person in front of me has a lovely looking baguette.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-23 19:01:28	Why is it that the last tweet i can see is from 9 hours ago?
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-24 07:32:43	So pleased everything in the news is so cheerful again today. We're all doomed as usual.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-24 16:25:53	yay it's friday! I shall mostly be eating and drinking this weekend
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-24 19:38:48	drinking woo woos!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-27 16:36:45	I can see a rainbow :-)
20050557	alilabbett	2009-04-28 16:44:37	Why would you throw Hula Hoops around? Such a waste.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-05-13 16:44:42	Why do men wear braces? What's wrong with a belt?
20050557	alilabbett	2009-06-24 09:10:16	Mmmm. McDonald's breakfast!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-06-23 20:05:16	Three days off and the sun's going to shine. I'm off camping!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-06-26 16:01:22	Even the umpire sounds fed up of all the noise Azarenka's making. Shut up woman, hit the ball quietly!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-06-24 16:25:54	Having a beer in the sunshine. Camping's brilliant!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-06-28 19:14:09	Richard Hammond's hair is just ridiculous now.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-06-29 18:21:03	Come on Andy, sort yourself out.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-06-29 21:48:51	Wow, what a match - an absolute epic! Well done Andy Murray.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-10 16:21:26	@jimmycarr I hope you're funny too because i'm coming to see you!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-17 14:28:46	@paullabbett you're so behind the times. We've had it at work for ages!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-28 06:39:40	Ok. He stinks of booze. Might explain why he's topless at 7.30 in the morning at the station too. Or Maybe he's just a tw*t!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-29 07:12:16	Bit knackered today. Must have done too much canoeing and cycling in my lounge yesterday
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-30 12:44:44	I get it now. Rainy and miserable in southampton. Beautiful blue skies and sunshine in bournemouth. I forget it's always sunny at home!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-31 16:17:35	The man next to me on the train is having a coughing fit while rolling cigarettes. Think there's an irony there. Wish he'd stop coughing tho
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-28 06:37:10	Why would any self respecting man think jeans half way down his arse and pink pants on view is a good look?
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-28 17:11:37	Stupid stupid buses
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-30 12:27:43	It was supposed to be sunny all day today so how come i just got caught in a huge downpour?
20050557	alilabbett	2009-08-01 15:12:36	Watching Dave play frisbee golf on Wii Sports Resort
20050557	alilabbett	2009-08-05 07:08:27	Watch out for the flying ants. They're everywhere!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-08-07 08:07:28	Just had a very lucky escape. The biggest bird poo in the world ever just missed my head by centimetres
20050557	alilabbett	2009-08-10 16:29:15	Why can't everyone just get along?
20050557	alilabbett	2009-08-11 19:50:51	You don't have no 'r', you have noir. Stupid man.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-05 19:23:48	@kes1981 I'm getting the impression you're not a Federer fan! Mind you, I agree with everything you've said!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-11 18:35:51	We've cleared out the loft and i've just cleaned the oven. Rock and roll!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-12 17:36:33	Loving the cricket. Come on England!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-12 19:14:50	Richard Hammond's hair gets more stupid every week.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-08-06 17:09:59	Rubbish. Think i left my headphones on the train. Too distracted by the fact facebook wouldn't work
20050557	alilabbett	2009-08-17 16:44:58	Manic looking sweaty and slightly smelly man sat on train in front of me. Bit scared.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-08-19 21:05:12	Found the stupid woman on location location location really annoying. What was all that energy stuff about?
20050557	alilabbett	2009-08-23 16:19:11	Come on England - nearly there!!
20050557	alilabbett	2009-08-23 16:51:09	Woohooo! Well done England! All credit to the Aussies though, they put up a good fight.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-09-05 20:00:18	Why are things so difficult in the stupid cube?
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-23 06:50:10	@davidlabbett No! What about the darts? What about Bobby George?
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-24 07:09:52	Why are 9 million people an hour visiting the swine flu web site?! Ridiculous.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-09-02 16:29:30	Think i just saw Chris Martin from Coldplay on the train. Would he be travelling from waterloo to weymouth in standard class?
20050557	alilabbett	2009-07-28 09:29:42	@davidlabbett i should have taken a picture of his friend's hairy bum when he mooned at the train after he got off.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-08-06 16:29:08	Had a lovely time at Cowes. Chips, Pimms and ice cream! Left before the rain came too.
20050557	alilabbett	2009-08-06 17:37:27	The bus driver's just asked an old lady how she is and she said "drunk" then she gave him a Mars bar
20050557	alilabbett	2010-01-20 21:15:30	@kes1981 Seriously. How did they win anything. And why are there so many of them?
20050557	alilabbett	2010-01-20 21:32:08	Well done Stephen Fry, well deserved.
20050557	alilabbett	2010-01-27 21:31:18	Stupid freight train. Why is freight more important  than people.
20050557	alilabbett	2010-01-10 20:39:10	Well done Wolfie. Great match! Loved the 170 checkout too!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-02-06 18:48:04	Well done England. Great result. I love beating the Welsh!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-02-13 16:29:23	Although I would have loved to  have seen Scotland beat Wales, the way they lost was hilarious!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-01-11 11:43:15	@GemmaSaint Yep i'll be there. Looking forward to catching up x
20050557	alilabbett	2010-02-26 21:11:46	At Dave Gorman. Very funny
20050557	alilabbett	2010-03-02 18:54:14	@kes1981 completely agree. They're both rubbish.
20050557	alilabbett	2010-01-31 21:14:35	Since when was the baddie in 24 called Davros?!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-05-06 12:49:27	I'm fed us with Twitter celebs telling people how to vote. Yes, tell them to vote, but we're all capable of making our own minds up.
20050557	alilabbett	2010-09-16 14:21:17	I love Stephen Fry and hate the Daily Mail, so loved this.
http://www.stephenfry.com/2010/09/16/dailymailhate/
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-17 12:49:57	@kes1981 I was there yesterday!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-01 07:27:45	Was planning on settling in to watch the golf all day but looks like the weather may put paid to that.
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-20 07:46:47	@claireangel Bet it's going to be an interesting few days too ...
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-20 18:17:51	@GemmaSaint Is there something she's not telling you about her future ambitions...
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-20 18:20:53	@claireangel There's a shock! Can't wait to hear all the gossip x
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-20 20:42:38	I really don't like Melissa #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-20 20:52:39	@claireangel Hilarious that she wanted to charge £1.82 for one bread roll too.
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-01 21:46:53	@GemmaSaint Good thanks Gem. Hope you enjoyed Center Parcs. How was family cheerleading?
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-03 22:09:57	@themills23 It's a travesty!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-24 14:49:28	@GemmaSaint Well done Gemma! You doing it again next year?!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-07 15:15:58	At BBC TV Centre for Harry Hill
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-07 15:17:34	Panicked when I saw the queue then realised they were all waiting for Alan Titchmarsh!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-08 18:33:47	Mmmmm...Ikea meatballs!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-13 20:58:03	Loving how shocked Joanna was every time someone criticised her crappy bookease #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-27 20:13:03	@kes1981 Me too. So annoying
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-27 20:20:52	You're shit Melissa, that's why he doesn't want you to pitch #Apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-27 21:01:39	Stroppy cow. Good riddance #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-27 21:04:27	Oh my God. Look at Melissa's hair now! #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-28 15:12:41	BBC News - 'Haitch' or 'aitch'? How do you pronounce 'H'? http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11642588 It's 'aitch'! I hate 'haitch'.
20050557	alilabbett	2010-10-31 12:34:45	@claireangel One of the most shocking things I've seen on tv for ages. I was gutted!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-11-03 21:38:53	I don't like Paloma. Never have. #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-11-03 21:54:22	Paloma is such a liar. #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-11-03 21:59:15	Good choice. She was such a cocky cow. #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-11-06 20:08:37	@themills23 I'm at the pub so not watching x factor but i think i would agree with everything you've said!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-11-10 21:15:21	The Blitz was a big bombing thing years ago... Great description Alex. #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-11-10 22:13:06	I'm not sure anyone ever thought Alex was a 'creative powerhouse'? #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-01 21:42:33	The girl's were crap at negotiating. #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-01 21:49:08	@kes1981 Didn't he look cool in his sunglasses too!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-01 21:52:11	@GemmaSaint Well done Gem! That took a while...!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-01 22:00:58	I really don't want to have anything to do with Stuart's eels next week. #apprentice

20050557	alilabbett	2010-11-17 21:42:08	Stuart has had such a lucky escape. Such an idiot. #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-11-24 21:08:48	Famous last words Stuart? "I can't lose in this task" #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-11-24 21:10:47	I thought Goulash was Hungarian? #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-11-24 21:44:53	I've gone off that Jamie #apprentice

20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-08 21:23:56	What's the largest river in London? #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-08 21:30:09	I can't find words to express how annoying I find Stuart. #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-08 21:42:09	@claireangel It has to be Stuart. Surely. Please!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-08 21:50:41	Alan Sugar must be jumping at the chance to start a company with Stuart. #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-08 22:09:53	@kes1981 It's good to see Margaret back. She'll see through Stuart. Someone has too.
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-10 22:00:04	Think they were a bit harsh on Matt tonight. Kara was great as usual though. #strictly
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-11 18:58:35	You've got to love Take That!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-11 19:02:09	Right Strictly's done, time for X Factor. It's a right marathon tonight.
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-11 19:07:15	Go away Cher, you've annoyed me already
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-11 20:30:38	What a shock duet for Cher -not. Not sure about the black tights and White trainers either. #xfactor
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-11 20:56:21	Let's hope that's the last we ever see of Cher. #xfactor
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-11 20:57:02	@kes1981 Woohoo!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-12 18:53:30	Just had a lone carol singer come to the door and he sang we wish you a Merry Christmas and ... Last Christmas which was, umm, unusual!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-12 19:46:44	Cheryl is so wet, I wish she would get excited once in a while and stop being so soppy.
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-12 20:00:22	What a flattering likeness the pizza of Matt's head was. #xfactor
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-12 20:32:03	Definitely the best final 2. One Direction were a bit too karaoke.
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-12 20:55:53	I think Matt's song was best...
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-12 21:17:23	@kes1981 You can get a lot done between the odd song though!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-01-11 13:11:06	Scary video-Didn't think things could get worse! Brisbane residents urged to evacuate http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12158608
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-14 22:04:40	@claireangel Going far?
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-16 18:20:53	@claireangel 
That didn't take long! Well done - send me a copy
20050557	alilabbett	2011-01-13 20:22:42	I'm sure they'll all turn out fine in the end so no need to torture myself by watching weeks of agonising tv. #michelroux
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-18 16:38:10	@kes1981 how much snow have you got? We're staying near Stow at Christmas - supposed to be coming on Monday!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-18 16:43:46	@kes1981 jolly good! Could make for an interesting journey on Monday....
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-18 22:05:26	Really pleased for Kara and Artem - deserving winners!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-19 18:32:21	@kes1981 the man who owns the house we're staying in this week says there's 20 inches of snow. Is he exaggerating the size of an inch?
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-19 20:53:23	You've got to love David Beckham!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-19 20:54:07	Don't reckon the apprentice is going to start on time.
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-19 21:03:34	I wonder if Jessica Ennis is annoyed that she was beaten by a darts player - I wonder how their training differs!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-19 21:11:50	I hope Baggs the brand is on tonight's show #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-19 21:13:40	@kes1981 might be stopping at your house if we can't get there ;-)
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-19 21:16:45	Joanna will want to make paprika flavoured vodka #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-19 21:24:24	Alex clearly has a good grip of the Italian language #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-19 21:37:13	I don't fancy going to a club with Chris #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-19 22:06:52	Poor old Chris. Think Stella deserved it though. #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-19 23:09:08	Why do planes need to be defrosted when they fly at minus temperatures all the time?
20050557	alilabbett	2011-01-09 13:28:48	What a lovely day to be beside the seaside.
20050557	alilabbett	2011-01-09 17:44:04	Apologies for repeating myself, but ... Come on Wolfie! #lakeside
20050557	alilabbett	2011-01-09 20:28:56	Well done Wolfie. You had me worried for a while! #lakeside
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-20 16:51:05	We have made it to the Cotswolds. Not sure when we'll be able to make it out again!
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-22 19:35:51	Man found dead in holdall had help getting into it - no, really? http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-12059910
20050557	alilabbett	2011-01-13 20:21:04	Not sure I can watch Michel Roux's service - everyone annoys me. #michelroux
20050557	alilabbett	2011-01-18 21:59:16	@kes1981 I couldn't watch more than 30 seconds - had to turn off after I saw the dress with fairy lights! #bfgw
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-31 22:44:37	@claireangel @gemmasaint Happy new year girls! Looking forward to seeing you soon x
20050557	alilabbett	2010-12-31 22:46:55	@kes1981 Lovely hat! Happy new year x
20050557	alilabbett	2011-01-26 19:45:35	Benidorm??!!! Who watches that? #nta
20050557	alilabbett	2011-01-05 07:32:02	@chrisdjmoyles I'm listening to local radio for the second day running. It's really not good. Can you come back tomorrow?!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-01-05 20:10:33	Why is motorised skateboarding so terrifying? #famousandfearless
20050557	alilabbett	2011-01-05 20:15:30	What is Sam Branson famous for? #famousandfearless
20050557	alilabbett	2011-01-05 20:21:24	Stopped watching. It's rubbish. #famousandfearless
20050557	alilabbett	2011-01-06 18:36:16	Come on Wolfie! #lakeside
20050557	alilabbett	2011-01-06 19:08:43	@claireangel I know! I thought that when I saw it on the news. Very wierd!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-04 20:13:19	@kes1981 and he's got a stupid moustache!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-04 21:09:38	@claireangel the rules change all the time so don't bother learning them!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-04 21:29:51	@kes1981 unless we win!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-05 20:12:54	Good to have #Harryhill back. Particularly liked the human mannequin!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-01-07 19:57:09	16 years in prison and a kidney for nicking £11! http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12138253

20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-04 19:29:07	Come on England! #6nations
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-04 20:22:18	Eddie Butler needs to be a bit clearer - was he talking about a Scarlet's winger or a Scarlet Swinger? #6nations
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-04 21:11:58	Eddie Butler really shouldn't be allowed to commentate - he's so biased #6nations
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-04 21:14:40	@kes1981 Brian Moore does my head in too but at least he's impartial!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-04 21:25:42	The Welsh will be unbearable if they win now #6nations
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-04 21:31:41	Come on Johnny #6nations
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-04 21:38:15	Well done England! Great result #6nations
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-09 17:16:27	@claireangel more interesting (and heartwarming!) than most of the stuff on the news!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-05 16:58:56	Not sure I can support France or Scotland. I'd happily see either of them thrashed! #6nations

20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-15 21:29:34	Think the Voiceover woman's been told to perk up a bit - I noted a tiny bit of excitement in her voice #brits
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-15 21:44:22	What kind of weird jumper is Mark Owen wearing?! #Brits
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-16 18:33:15	@Claireangel Now that's something to look forward to!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-16 19:06:59	@claireangel It is a classic!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-16 22:01:08	Poor old Terry, I thought he should have gone through. And Polly was like a seal when she went through! #masterchef
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-17 13:17:35	What a strange shaped head this man has - he should be easy to find! http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/34503/8856209
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-14 14:07:42	@GemmaSaint Only £1? Should have been free meals for life after that!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-15 23:40:39	Went on my first lifeboat tonight. It was a bit choppy but a good trip round the Farne Islands anyway - even in the dark!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-17 09:13:00	Want to keep listening to & watching @chrisdjmoyles but really have to go to work. Can't wait to tune in again later #R1MoreMoyles
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-05 17:22:10	A massive thank you to vodka revolution n Bath - a fantastic cocktail making lesson after which I'm a bit pissed!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-18 08:52:54	Wow! £1.8 million raised by @chrisdjmoyles and @davidvitty. And there's still time left... Incredible. Well done boys! #R1MoreMoyles
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-06 11:01:13	The healing power of a McDonalds breakfast never ceases to amaze me
20050557	alilabbett	2011-04-11 21:31:36	A cracking finale to #wakingthedead A great end to a great show.
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-19 18:05:11	@kes1981 Eddie Butler every time!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-19 18:09:22	Come on Johnny, sort them out #6nations
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-07 18:16:42	I just got a £1.69 bottle of water free by paying £1 for a newspaper I didn't want! Fortunately it wasn't the Daily Mail - couldn't do that!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-24 14:15:04	Julian Assange is really boring - not sure I've ever heard anyone talk so slowly. Get on with it!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-11 16:09:11	Just bought tickets to see the Yankees in New York in June - very excited! #Yankees
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-12 16:15:03	Great result. Well done Italy #6nations
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-13 16:02:59	More of that please England #6nations
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-13 16:35:38	You just had to pass the bloody ball! #6nations
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-13 16:41:27	About bloody time England. It is Scotland we're playing, not the All Blacks #6nations
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-13 16:57:28	Phew! Good effort Scotland - or were we shit?! #6nations
20050557	alilabbett	2011-03-13 17:00:44	@kes1981 I hope so!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-26 14:34:01	Come on Italy! #6nations
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-26 15:05:15	Harsh no try decision for Italy, reckon that could have been given #6nations
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-26 18:56:55	Well done England - good win. #6nations
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-27 09:16:08	What an idiot (polite term for him) Ashley Cole 'shoots student at Chelsea's training ground' | Metro.co.uk http://t.co/jbXXN3G
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-27 17:06:28	What a game of cricket! England threw it away really, but probably a fair result.
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-27 18:12:31	I hate Arsene Wenger's stupid oversized duvet coat.
20050557	alilabbett	2011-02-27 18:13:45	Well done Birmingham though - love seeing Arsenal lose!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-04-02 13:25:59	Wayne Rooney is such a tw*t and such a bad role model. Why swear right into the camera? Idiot.
20050557	alilabbett	2011-04-26 16:05:28	The engineers should have worked a bit harder this weekend - I've spent too much time waiting for trains today because of them #veryannoyed
20050557	alilabbett	2011-04-07 21:35:09	Good to see Johnny Vegas in the Masters. Must have been on some kind of weird diet though cos he looks quite different!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-04-08 13:19:49	Alex Ferguson is such a sore loser. Just because he didn't get his own way for once http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13013741.stm

20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-06 09:51:59	@vivek_pande completely agree - if you don't want to get caught, don't do it!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-06 09:54:23	@kes1981 you have to tell me all the best places you went to in NY - we're going in June!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-06 14:29:07	@kes1981 thank you, that would be much appreciated!!

20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-11 20:24:54	Were all these girls on the apprentice last night? I've never seen some of them before #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-11 20:41:03	What? The girl's app was rubbish? Did they download a thousand copies each?! #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-11 20:53:44	Alex's face annoys me #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-12 20:21:31	I seem to be watching Jedward on #Eurovision
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-12 20:25:29	Not sure what to think about that. Didn't like their shoulder pads though #bbcEurovision
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-12 20:27:17	Having said that, would be brilliant if Jedward won! #bbcEurovision
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-24 12:19:51	@claireangel that was a long time coming!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-25 20:17:46	There are a lot of rough people on the train tonight!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-25 21:46:29	Favourite line from tonight's #apprentice 'You've got nice hair, would you like a massage?'
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-14 19:29:31	Would rather have heard Bewitched's version of C'est La Vie #bbcEurovision
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-14 19:33:42	Bring on Jedward #bbcEurovision
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-14 19:37:53	I so want Jedward to win #bbcEurovision
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-14 19:49:29	Think Greece is my new least favourite #bbcEurovision
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-14 19:53:37	Nope, it's Russia now. Too cheesy. #bbcEurovision
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-14 20:12:24	Blue should do quite well but they are English and everyone hates us #bbcEurovision
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-14 20:14:05	I like Moldova! #bbcEurovision
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-14 20:32:37	How is Azerbaijan in Europe? #bbcEurovision
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-14 20:38:51	@kes1981 You've just about missed all if it! Except the scores which is the best bit!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-14 21:05:43	Favourites are Finland (cos he was cute) Denmark, Ireland obviously, Moldova and England #bbcEurovision
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-14 21:34:58	Seriously, Greece were shit! #bbcEurovision
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-14 21:57:56	But Bosnia were shit too! #bbcEurovision
20050557	alilabbett	2011-05-14 22:23:13	I don't mind the Azerbaijan song, but they're not European! Still at least Greece or Bosnia didn't win #bbcEurovision
20050557	alilabbett	2011-06-08 20:47:02	Forgotten how annoying Edna is - and she can't talk properly #bbcapprentice

20050557	alilabbett	2011-06-01 21:16:20	Vincent is such a twat. Has he learned nothing? And where did he get that shirt from? #apprentice
20050557	alilabbett	2011-06-01 21:32:17	Despite everything I think we will miss Vincent - he was one of the few interesting, although admittedly annoying, characters #bbcapprentice

20050557	alilabbett	2011-06-28 18:27:48	@paullabbett Not in Bournemouth! It's sunny here, naturally!
20050557	alilabbett	2011-06-29 10:01:23	@claireangel That will be hot - I went in June once and it was a real scorcher. Make good use of the air conditioned bars!

20050557	alilabbett	2011-07-03 13:51:35	I thought Nadal bounced the ball a lot but at least he does it quick - Djokovic takes ages #wimbledon

20050557	alilabbett	2014-02-19 21:23:30	So far I've found all the performances on the #BRITs a bit dull. And a bit more variety in the nominations wouldn't go amiss!
20050557	alilabbett	2014-02-19 21:30:13	@KirstiPawlowski they might turn up yet!

20050557	alilabbett	2014-05-10 22:26:49	I don't get it? Is #ConchitaWurst a man trying to be a woman or a woman with a beard? #EurovisionSongContest2014
20050557	alilabbett	2014-05-10 22:27:45	Because if you want to be a woman why would you have a beard? #EurovisionSongContest2014

20050557	alilabbett	2014-08-15 21:50:21	Can anyone tell me what happens on the last 9 mins of Captain Phillips? #nowtv has decided not to show it to me.
20050557	alilabbett	2014-08-15 21:56:24	I've now seen the end of Captain Phillips and everything was alright. Phew.

20050557	alilabbett	2015-04-13 14:58:19	Ready for power. The thought of him having power terrifies me! Miliband says he is 'ready' to lead country http://t.co/C7EPfxxHnm
20050557	alilabbett	2015-04-22 19:40:13	@laurenvhockey oh no! Is he ok?
20050557	alilabbett	2015-04-30 21:00:22	I am loving #PeterKaysCarShare That is all.
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-03 06:49:39	A great story for innuendo lovers! Dorset knob throwing: Hopes high for record http://t.co/XrCeCVfZHj
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-04 14:25:31	@afcbournemouth I have even more respect for Eddie Howe now I know he's an A-ha fan!  https://t.co/wyV7UQd0Fk
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-05 14:19:56	I love the mother and father's occupations! https://t.co/ImMrIQ2VR4
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-06 21:10:37	I wish Labour would stop going on about 'working families: I'm part of a working family, so is David Beckham, but we're not the same!
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-06 21:13:28	And I didn't think I could find anyone more annoying than Alec Salmond, but Nicola Sturgeon has exceeded my expectations.
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-06 21:17:22	@paullabbett It's all got so boring!
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-06 21:31:26	@KevinPatrick7 Is there a Milliband fish?
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-07 21:05:58	I'm finding the BBC graphics a bit creepy #GE2015
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-07 21:11:28	@GemmaSaint the blinking is unnecessary!!
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-08 19:22:15	@bournemouthbc @TheWightBear But you've replaced them in Pokesdown, so why don't we get them in Southbourne?
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-08 11:06:58	Nice words from Nick Clegg, who no matter what you think of his politics, seems like a really nice guy: http://t.co/MuXxVOdwUQ via @BBCNews
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-08 21:08:07	@MelVassEcho @Bournemouthecho have West Southbourne results been announced?
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-08 21:09:47	@YellowBuses @TheWightBear how about unveiling a new bus stop outside on opening day? 😉
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-08 21:16:40	Fed up of seeing Alec Salmond going on about Scottish lions - England has lions,  Scotland has thistles.
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-09 14:41:38	Fascinating stuff! https://t.co/Otso4Gtzsa
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-11 18:57:09	Very clever! https://t.co/IFK8uRdLFb
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-19 11:41:23	@paullabbett the loyal fans seem pretty happy according to news reports!
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-19 11:52:22	@paullabbett not sure where you got 40% from....?! #afcb
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-19 12:03:49	@marksinkinson @paullabbett think an extra £70 a year is good to watch prem teams. I don't really care, I don't go!!
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-19 12:04:43	@marksinkinson @paullabbett just don't like things being misreported #afcb
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-19 12:16:50	@paullabbett @marksinkinson sorry 550
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-21 18:06:31	@kes1981 if I'd known I would have come to cheer you on. I could have provided refreshments half way!
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-22 21:01:18	Love, love, loved #PeterKaysCarShare
20050557	alilabbett	2015-05-31 20:56:44	A dog?! Of all the acts - good and bad, a dog won? Ridiculous. #BGTfinal
20050557	alilabbett	2015-06-07 15:17:28	Really impressed with #OpenFarmSunday at Beckley Farm, a really great free day out.
20050557	alilabbett	2015-06-12 09:28:40	@theICcrowd Anyone got any examples of good inclusion and diversity comms campaigns? Particularly looking to challenge perceptions.
20050557	alilabbett	2015-06-12 20:17:12	Watching #TFIFriday takes me back to good times and great memories. Loving it.
