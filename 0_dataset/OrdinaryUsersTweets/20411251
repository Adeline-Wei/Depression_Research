20411251	cavalry1	2011-02-13 23:13:39	In regards to my last tweet, I'd still be more than happy to get one. In fact I'd be extremely happy, so in that case... Kinda relevant
20411251	cavalry1	2011-02-14 08:13:33	@subvader whoooooaaaaa easy with that talk... Blink 182 = Legends, 3OH!3 = Rapper wannabes.... hahaha

20411251	cavalry1	2011-02-15 02:34:28	@subvader hahahaha yea. I liked 30h!3 at first, can't lie but then they seemed to fall of the deep end for me...
20411251	cavalry1	2011-02-15 02:34:53	@subvader I like how Blink's sound has matured with each album at least; tho the subject matter maybe not as much lolll
20411251	cavalry1	2011-02-15 18:54:00	@subvader oh hell yea, they may have matured but all the old albums are my fav, Dude Ranch is prob one of my fav albums ever
20411251	cavalry1	2011-02-15 18:54:44	@subvader Buddha and Chesire are also really high up there... Untitled was aight but the raw-ness of the first couple was amazing
20411251	cavalry1	2011-02-15 18:55:37	@subvader And yea, 3OH!3's first album was actually pretty dope but then idk what happened to them... Collabing w/ Kesha and shit wtf haha

20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-25 05:53:14	@sampology oh word, was always curious as to what overseas DJs do

20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-31 21:46:40	@subvader just so many knobs and options its absurd. At least I have Battery 3 mastered more or less so I can sample like crazy for now haha
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-31 21:52:02	@subvader thats what I assume, I'm just such a simple/straightforward producer type, so lots of buttons/knobs frustrate me to no end...haha
20411251	cavalry1	2011-04-01 08:53:09	wrapping it tomorrow tho, still gonna be a work in progress tho! Feel like I can do so much with it beyond the time I have before the show
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-18 00:07:50	@misterbradleyp yea i feel u bout the bands but alot ofthem seem like spin/nme hipster specials... least i know the djs u know?
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-18 10:03:37	@misterbradleyp unfortunately accidently sat at a johnny bottle service dj show... left promptly too. Totally know what you mean now!
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-18 10:06:02	@misterbradleyp luckily been avoiding those shows as much as I can, but I feel u don't get me wrong...
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-18 10:13:28	@djmobeatz missed u today but I got BOTH times locked in for Sat so I WONT miss u hahaha, maybe c u around tomorrow! dont wile too hard haha
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-18 10:15:39	@DILLONFRANCIS pleasure meeting u 2nite! I appreciate all ur advice and tips too, will definitely keep them all in mind.

20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-18 19:31:27	dumbest/weirdest spam email I've gotten yet: "Put your doughnut in her oven"
WTF DOES THAT MEAN?!?!?! You don't even put doughnuts IN ovens!
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-18 19:40:30	@misterbradleyp hahahaha yea, I mean it's probably easy for ppl to say its amazing when its THE ONLY ONE in CLE...
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-18 20:02:00	@DILLONFRANCIS oh yea, u also played it during moombahton portion of ur set, somewhere before Masta Blasta I think, stuck in my head! haha
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-18 20:06:12	@DILLONFRANCIS oh well, I appreciate it ALOT for checking, when I come to ur next shows if u drop it again I'll make sure to get at u!
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-18 20:55:04	@misterbradleyp dont mean to butt in on ur convo but I totally agree with @Thegoldfather, lot of space for DJs!
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-18 20:56:07	@misterbradleyp @Thegoldfather crowd wise the venues are small so even 25 ppl make it look rly packed, which I think is nice for smaller DJs
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-18 20:57:35	@misterbradleyp what do u think @Thegoldfather? I just think there r so many ppl EVERYwhere that just playing will catch alot of ppls ears
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-18 20:58:28	@Thegoldfather gonna be at AM only, Fader Fort and Fools Gold party today, maybe moombahton party too, hope to catch up finally... haha
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-18 21:45:52	@misterbradleyp I have a pass, but the only thing that sux is that when its a BIG name act, even with a pass, the lines are ABSURD
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-18 21:47:05	@misterbradleyp for example the line for Killer Mike was around the block and that was WITH passes... imo better 2 c the smaller acts
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-06 07:34:04	@misterbradleyp hear hear!
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-06 11:33:27	@misterbradleyp I see the words soul and funk and I AM IN! This is me Hollabacking

20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-19 18:36:11	nice seeing u guys again last nite @catchdini @atrak. The @FoolsGoldRecs party is always one of my fav's of SXSW! Had a great time
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-19 19:14:49	@YoVEVO SXSW music wristbands same priority as badges?
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-20 23:16:01	Missed Kid Cudi, Mr Hudson, Pusha T, Big Sean, Cyhi, Mos Def, Kanye, Jay Z., Diddy, & Beyonce for free last nite cuz security was wack! #fb
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-20 23:18:10	@YoVEVO had one of the coolest potential events last nite, too bad they FAILED miserably @ planning it... Couldn't organize a baby shower
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-20 23:18:56	@YoVEVO some advice, next time maybe less hype & tweeting and more planning.
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-20 23:19:38	@YoVEVO I was at the front of the line and left cuz the organization was soo wack... Thats a pretty bad sign & I wasnt the only one who left
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-20 23:20:39	Also some dbag with a faux hawk tried starting shit w/ me cuz he was there for "7 hrs"... Woooww, no life? probably jerks it to Kanye pix
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-20 23:21:34	All of @sxsw was pretty much a major fail yesterday, need to reevaluate the mission statement... is it about up & coming acts or HUGE acts?
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-20 23:22:30	Very disappointed with my @sxsw experience yesterday, also why r there so many huge "free" unofficial events taking over? fuck that
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-20 23:23:22	The @sxsw that I loved showcased and focused on new acts who deserve the attention, if I wanted big acts I'd go to coachella or bonnaroo
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-20 23:24:53	also the Red Bull 3style event was soooo wack... Now that the great @DJ_AM passed, DJs feels like its cool to rip off ALL of his routines?
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-20 23:25:50	@lodotrim except I didnt cut in line cuz I was already at the front w/ a badge... so not sure what your point is?
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-20 23:28:32	@lodotrim no, there were 2 lines side by side and all of a sudden 1 became the "Badge" line which I was excluded from...ppl were absurd
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-20 23:29:43	Also almost all tracks at red bull 3style were top 40 from 2rs ago? wtf? Thats why I appreciate DJs like @atrak & @diplo 4 keeping it fresh!
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-20 23:31:03	3 DJs in a row played "Stay Fly"...wtf, these are the "Top DJs"?! At least I'm sure Z-Trip, Qbert, and Jazzy Jeff killed it, True innovators
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-20 23:39:39	Only upside of yesterday was finally seeing @djmobeatz (GET OFFICIAL!) haha and @BigSean! Loved he inspirational words at the end! Real talk
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-20 23:40:52	@djmobeatz was cutting it up real nice, love that so much (footage up soon) and @BigSean real energetic & inspiring the up & comers! luv it

20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-21 00:06:48	@misterbradleyp could stand enuff 2 c D-JR, M-Squared, & Mick Boogie, heard Switch walking by, seemed like only 1 playing different shit
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-21 00:07:49	@misterbradleyp and I know Mick Boogie from CLE which is cool, but did a lot of wordplay stuff which DJ AM was doing 2 yrs ago...
20411251	cavalry1	2011-03-21 00:08:39	@misterbradleyp other DJs I missed were Qbert, Jazzy Jeff, & Z-Trip

20411251	cavalry1	2011-04-20 16:22:08	Is no song sacred from the perversion of bad dubstep?!?!?! How are you going to remix Brand New's "Daisy", its already as good as it can get
20411251	cavalry1	2011-04-20 22:49:55	Found my new dreamy synth... Moog lil Phatty, sooo nice #fb
20411251	cavalry1	2011-04-20 23:32:47	Now Benny Benassi is making dubstep?! So everyone is just cashing in on the action now huh? smh #fb
20411251	cavalry1	2011-04-01 08:52:18	Thought my song was about done and ready to master but then I added ONE new sound and ended up completely reorganizing the entire track
20411251	cavalry1	2011-04-10 23:54:41	I am one of the biggest Justice fans out there but their new track is pretty unimpressive imo
20411251	cavalry1	2011-04-11 07:26:00	@savageskulls @bot106 @phrappuccino Calling it now... "Bust Em Up" the biggest track of the year, not sure how it could possibly be topped!

20411251	cavalry1	2011-10-28 16:21:23	@MisterBradleyP hahahaha Thriller in EVERY set I'm sure...
20411251	cavalry1	2011-10-28 16:22:02	@MisterBradleyP cause thats the ONLY "halloween" song right?
20411251	cavalry1	2011-10-28 16:32:44	Guilty of spending time on fashion blogs for NYC and San Fran just to see whats up but I have to admit NYC fashion &gt; SF Fashion so far :(
20411251	cavalry1	2011-11-01 21:40:55	@DJVajra damn you for being so mysterious about this... hahaha When I find this out I swear I'm gonna lose it... or if I dont haha
20411251	cavalry1	2011-11-01 21:48:07	@DJVajra anyway u would consider sending me the fx file from the serato fx folder for it? I can keep looking if not, I WILL discover it haha
20411251	cavalry1	2011-11-01 21:49:18	@DJVajra my need may sound dumb but I've always wanted to incorporate things in my set like your pitch shift or @atrak w/ Robot Rock routine
20411251	cavalry1	2011-11-02 02:58:30	@DJVajra got a similar effect going with bit crusher but still not as good. to start - is it in the beats,depth, FLT, or feedback settings?
20411251	cavalry1	2011-11-02 17:03:02	@DJVajra got close last night messing with Feedback, beats, and FB Flt, but still no cigar... could I at least get a hint? ur killin me haha
20411251	cavalry1	2011-11-02 17:05:38	@DJVajra regardless - just want to say I cant get your routine out of my head and you are one of the illest DJs ever...
20411251	cavalry1	2011-11-02 17:06:16	@DJVajra trying to learn some of your scratches is worlds away harder than messing with the damn fx hahahaha - inspiration tho!
20411251	cavalry1	2011-10-21 00:07:07	@MisterBradleyP u know if Robb from Just Cuz has twitter or facebook? been trying to connect for some time but cant find him... thanks!
20411251	cavalry1	2011-10-21 03:51:16	@MisterBradleyP word... I figured. Thanks man! Hope all is well in CLE, definitely miss it and looks like u have some great shows coming up!

20411251	cavalry1	2011-10-30 19:04:41	last second retro b-ball player costume was apparently a success... or at least according to how many ppl tried to grab my butt hahahaha
20411251	cavalry1	2011-10-31 22:41:30	@DJVajra I have been playing with the echo fx for the last two days but still nothing... is it with DJ-FX or the Rane FX on group 6?
20411251	cavalry1	2011-10-21 22:50:13	@DJVajra CONGRATS on the DMCs! Loved the video but have a big question... how did you do that effect at about 2:02? SOunded like pitch shift
20411251	cavalry1	2011-10-21 22:50:39	@DJVajra Have been trying to find an effect like that FOREVER on my TTMsl57
20411251	cavalry1	2011-10-23 20:10:53	the new Justice album is actually pretty damn solid... different than Cross but isnt that the point? Still got that signature crunch I love
