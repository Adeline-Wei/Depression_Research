20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:20:58	Attorney for Sydney Moorer says his client's relationship with #HeatherElvis ended before her disappearance.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:21:08	All law enforcement's resources focused on Syndey Moorer
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:23:13	@mgates1234 No, we are not.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:24:38	Sydney Moorers attorney says he did not call #HeatherElvis from payphone. Police tell him they have video of him. He says he did make call
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:25:08	Said he made the call to ask #HeatherElvis to stop relationship
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:25:35	Says the lie did not impede justice at all since it was so quickly revealed #HeatherElvis
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:28:23	Truslow says Solicitor Donna Elder represented at bond hearing what they would have in evidence for the case, DNA, etc.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:28:53	Truslow says all the DNA was tested, no direct evidence "There is no physical evidence" he says all evidence is circumstantial #HeatherElvis
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:29:45	Truslow says they were told #HeatherElvis DNA was found in the truck. But then turns out that was not true. Mistake by the lab
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:32:55	Truslow says Solicitor Donna Elder made a "big deal" that Moorers were gone from Horry County for a month. But says it was on a vacation.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:34:22	One of the most damming issues at first bond hearing, Truslow says, was that there was video of Sydney Moorer truck going to boat landing
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:35:45	Truslow says the prosecution told them FBI enhanced the truck video and 7 characteristics to ID truck by photometrics was from SC MAIT team
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:36:01	Truslow says SC MAIT team not qualified in photometrics
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:38:03	Truslow: State does not have expert witness to id that truck as Sydney Moorer's
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:38:47	Truslow says what you would have at trial is video of blurry vehicle go by and then come back. Would not be permitted to say its Syndey's
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:40:13	State also said that Moorers' made large cash withdraw from bank the day after at first bond hearing. Truslow says that is not true.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:41:06	Truslow also says at first bond hearing the police chief told the judge that Moorers had incited controversy and bond would be dangerous
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:43:43	Truslow: No direct evidence only circumstantial. The only evidence is Sydney's relationship. Sydney's call to Heather, her calls to him

20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:44:44	Truslow: In circumstantial cases you look at alternative explanations. He says he has 5 different situations that could have happened.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:45:30	Truslow: No flight risk from Sydney Moorer
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:47:18	Truslow: Sydney does not have a passport. He comes from a good family. No criminal record except shoplifting. No danger to community.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:48:48	Truslow: He has been locked up for a year on this.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:49:13	Truslow: He wants out now. Thinks a year in enough. He misses his children.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:50:18	Truslow: Sydney Moorers' parents would be willing to sign on to a PR bond, he believes. Home detention would also be OK by him
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:51:35	Truslow: Electronic monitoring would alleviate the need for a large monetary bond
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:52:44	Truslow: If no bond, he worries the case could go forward &amp; then nothing will happen on May 11 (Trial date) Don't know if May 11 is in stone
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:53:10	Truslow: Syndey Moorer has been labeled a "monster killer"
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:54:10	Truslow: Says the public have been fed information that Sydney is the killer
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:54:38	Tammy Moorer's attorney, Greg McCollum now speakimg
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:55:35	McCollum: Tammy Moorer and her family have lived in the community for her entire life.  No criminal record before this
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:56:37	McCollum: everything you would look at to say she is not a danger or flight risk, Tammy Moorer has it.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:57:11	McCollum: Not a matter where law enforcement was able to solve the case and then arrests made. Moorers' arrested to solve case
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:58:09	McCollum: Because phone call made from #HeatherElvis phone to Sydney Moorer, police started looking at Tammy and Sydney.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:58:40	McCollum: The Moorers cooperated with police, let them search the home, anything they wanted.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 15:59:19	McCollum: Other leads exist for case
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:00:02	McCollum: Prosecutor who previously had the case decided to "shock and awe" the Moorers
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:01:01	McCollum: Police took every communication device they had. Wouldn't let Tammy Moorer's parents go into their home for 7 hours.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:01:47	McCollum: The prosecutor believed Tammy Moorer was a killer. Tried to get Sydney Moorer to speak against her.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:02:32	McCollum: Tammy Moorer couldn't understand why she was even there
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:03:06	McCollum: Other than the phone call there really is nothing else. They were investigated as much as you could be
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:04:45	Solictors speaking now. Nancy Livesay addressing the court #heatherelvis
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:05:16	Livesay: Bond set for obstruction of justice charge in magistrate court and indecent exposure charge.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:06:19	Livesay: We are here for bond reconsideration. The material change in circumstances is we do not have what presented at initial bond hearing
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:08:38	Livesay: Syndey Moorer denied the phone call made to #heatherelvis, even without Tammy Moorer present
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:09:37	Livesay: I have to disagree with Mr. Truslow about the phone calls and the denial Sydney Moorer made
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:10:35	Livesay: Two voluntary statements made by #HeatherElvis co workers. Both two women say they saw 95 missed calls on #HeatherElvis phone
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:11:07	Livesay: Tammy Moorer made threatening text messages to #HeatherElvis.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:11:54	Livesay: The text messages were retried through the computer. Not the phone itself. Police taking all the electronics enabled the retrieval
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:12:35	Livesay: Sydney and Tammy made all the threatening messages. Not just one of them
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:13:37	Judge: The bond statute has changed since beginning of case
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:14:04	Judge: Length of time also now a consideration that can be considered. Not just a change of circumstances. #HeatherElvis
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:15:27	Judge: Not concerned about evidence issues
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:16:24	Judge: Not for me to determine evidence issues today. That's what the trial will decide. But It is an issue if Moorers are not being honest.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:18:11	Judge: We're not trying this today #HeatherElvis
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:19:06	Livesay: Anything that was presented at initial bond hearing had discovery that backed up everything that was said.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:19:27	Livesay: The only exception was the money withdrawn, which was a mistake.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:19:57	Livesay: No substantial change since 1st bond hearing. Judge: I agree with you.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:21:53	Judge: We try this case in May I look forward to trying it with you all.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:22:58	Judge: I have to presume these two are innocent. The public at large does not have to do that.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:23:46	Judge: Everyone charged with criminal offense is eligible for PR bond at the start, according to the law
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:24:25	Judge: If you have anything that presumes they are a flight risk please give it to me.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:25:28	Livesay: Sydney Moorer was a private contractor Does not have set location. Tammy Moorer at-home travel agent Neither was integrated w/ work
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:25:43	Livesay: I do believe they are a flight risk
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:26:01	Livesay: They have no ties to the community
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:26:31	Livesay: They have changed their entire life around the fact that they travel so much
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:27:02	Livesay: After this case started they had multiple pictures put up on Facebook of them holding weapons
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:27:24	Livesay: they have been very aggressive on social media.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:27:45	Livesay: If anything there is more a risk of flight when you're sitting waiting three months from trail
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:28:12	Livesay: We are asking for the bond to continually to be denied
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:28:33	Livesay: We find that they are a greater flight risk now than they were a year ago
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:29:12	Livesay asks for substantial bond, if court grants it, to ensure they show up for trial May 11
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:29:51	Judge: The public sees this as a bond to make it difficult for the Moorers, but that isn't what this is.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:32:15	Judge: do you have any direct evidence? Livesay: no
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:32:40	Livesay: Victims want to be heard when you're ready
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:33:09	Terry and Debbie Elvis taking the stand #HeatherElvis 's parents
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:34:10	Terry Elvis: Wouldn't presume to tell judge what to do.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:34:42	Terry Elvis: we have undergone massive amounts of threats from family members of the accused. Also threats from the accused prior to arrest
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:35:19	Terry: Our younger daughter has been threatened. I do not think it will stop until it goes to trial
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:35:52	Terry: Asking that judge considers the safety of the family and the safety of the community at large
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:36:20	Debbi Elvis: Pleading with you right now to consider bond in the area where it can protect us and our family
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:36:58	Debbi: Tammy Moorer disparaged #HeatherElvis on the Find Heather Elvis Facebook page.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:37:31	Debbi: it's finally started to get quieter. It's finally started to calm down until this hearing
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:38:10	Debbi: their family is causing a danger to the community acting on their behalf. keeping them in jail might dampen down those threats
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:38:40	Terry Elvis: SC victims bill of rights has no teeth. hoping you'll find a way to put some teeth to this
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:40:11	Judge: Bond is a dignified process that has been respected by all involved in this case
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:41:04	Judge: there is a balance that you have to achieve (between victims and accused)
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:42:04	Judge: Come to respect the Victims Bill of Rights since he first went to law school
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:42:33	Judge: Asks everyone to see the Moorers as innocent
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:44:01	Judge: Wants to follow the Golden Rule. Treat people as you want to be treated
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:44:19	Judge: I can't control you. My setting of a bond doesn't control you.
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:44:43	Judge: they're entitled to a bond
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:44:59	Judge: passage of time grounds for bond
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:46:04	Judge: I will set a bond
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:46:34	Judge: bond set $100,000 for both, gps monitoring
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:47:05	#HeatherElvis Judge sets bond at $100,000 for Tammy and Sydney Moorer. With some restrictions like GPS monitoring

20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:49:10	Judge: The last thing someone on bond wants to do is leave. Sends message that they are guility
20630658	wpdeabc15	2015-01-30 16:49:54	Judge: They can live anywhere in the state. Cannot live outside the state without permission. Bond covers all charges
