20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2009-04-06 22:18:12	can't figure out what is so exciting about twitter.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2009-09-20 23:17:08	twitter, I don't understand you, but I'm here because you keep telling me people are following me.  Must say...a little creepy

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2010-04-18 20:16:34	very long to-do list today. the consequences of fantastically unproductive weekend. no regrets there.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2010-06-25 23:48:41	in prep for teaching young, impressionable children, i have now set my tweets to private. bc there are so many and they are so inappropriate
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2010-06-25 23:51:59	also, i'm having a lonely friday night. seriously considering baking a batch of cookies. just for me. my summer 2k10 is outta control.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2010-06-28 20:23:07	philosophy of education is eroding my brain cells

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2011-07-21 18:55:18	Im gonna try the live tweet thing during my new teacher orientation. "Harassment: it's more than just sex now"
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2011-07-21 18:57:18	Nothing terrifies me more than words like "paperwork","benefits", "taxes", and any other jargon that my dad ironically deals w/ on the daily
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2011-08-22 17:41:48	My students dont know what instant messaging is. #imancient
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2011-08-07 03:44:44	Was TrueGrit supposed to be good? "girl annoys grumpy old men in Indian territory. search for father's killer. kind of find him. Horses."
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2011-08-08 13:54:54	"professional development" means endless/meaningless educational acronyms: HSTW NAEP MMSW TAP SWEB andchartsandchartsandgraphs

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-01-03 20:50:50	Please stop liking the Kardashians, all of them. It’s not helping anyone, least of all the Kardashians.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-01-03 20:52:37	Try food you think you don’t like but have never actually tried, unless it’s brussels sprouts. They really don’t need any more attention.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-01-03 20:52:58	Cut one person out of your life who you truly do not like and add one person who you truly do. Note: not on Facebook, on Earth.

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-01-27 01:16:15	whole CONCEPT of "self-deportation": a logical fallacy. "Oh I risked my life to escape my home country, but since you asked, sureI'llgoback"

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-01-27 02:00:22	Romney. again. you've gotta stop using any variation of the idea or phrase "you're fired". Trump decided against running for a reason...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-01-27 02:04:10	"get our fiscal house in order" might be my least fav political line. no one that's said it actually has feasible ideas to accomplish it
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-01-27 02:40:20	a Palestinian-American-Republican just asked a question and asserted "we exist". good for him, yet I truly am shocked.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-01-27 02:46:07	@russellwise indeed...

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-07-10 22:34:56	Watching the silliness on all the nightly news stations makes me that much more thankful for @nprpolitics
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-07-21 23:19:20	JUST SAID "WHAT'S UP" TO PAT SUMMIT. NO BIG DEAL. TOLD HER HOW MUCH I ADMIRE HER AS A WOMAN. I was in awe of her...everything.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-07-10 00:14:30	Offered to help grade @Bass_Sick_Math 's papers from first day of summer class and sub for him on Friday...forgot how much math scares me...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-07-10 00:16:08	This is how I know he's special. Cant imagine anyone else in the world for whom I would willingly subject myself to math-ness...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-07-10 00:17:18	@Bass_Sick_Math this should just show you how far dark chocolate brownies can take you in this relationship &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-07-10 00:20:05	BTW,had extended convo w/my dental hygienist about her English class in hs. both agreed Julius Caesar kinda sucks. BUT READING IS AWESOME!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-07-10 00:25:01	DH told me ALL her opinions on public Ed,Obama,&amp;fox news w/her tools in my mouth forcing me to make only a small whining noise in response.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-07-10 00:34:55	@russellwise @bass_sick_math then you should be solid on math 😉
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-07-10 01:23:29	DEAR EVERY NEWS SOURCE, LET ME SAVE YOU SOME TIME:  EVERYONE ALREADY KNOWS SCIENTOLOGY IS NUTS-O. NO ONE CARES ABOUT "TOM-CAT".
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-07-10 01:29:07	Piers Morgan, "What is scientology?!?".  A Person, "A 'religion' created *made-up* 60 yrs ago...blahblahblah"...NO ONE CARES
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-07-10 01:31:00	Perhaps death&amp;conflict in ISRAEL, SYRIA, IRAN, PAKISTAN, or...really...anything else...might possibly be a better use of airtime...

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-08-18 03:02:09	@chichimalcolm @tween_sensation the tweet itself is an example of hyperbole ;)

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-09-04 01:07:16	"he may be known as the 'drone' president"...yikes. Also hoping Clinton doesn't tell me how passionate he is about womens' issues at the DNC
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-09-04 01:09:29	What happens when you don't have respect for anyone running for or near the office of president for your country? #politicalapathy

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-09-30 21:29:08	is it irony?  nostalgia? playful ridicule?  or actual teen angst? important ?'s when discerning tweets from teens or just @tween_sensation

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-04 01:40:44	@PoeticSemetic @fight4fairness girl...so does every other politician...including our president. It's part of the game.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-04 01:46:28	@PoeticSemetic it's true. Obama's got a smirk, too. investigate any politician close enough; you find upsetting qualities. #chicagopolitics
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-04 01:54:00	My biggest frustration in this election is that I only have two choices...in a country this diverse and issues this vast. #lesseroftwoevils

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-10 21:42:43	A 15 year old girl in Pakistan is getting a Taliban BULLET removed from her HEAD today because she wants to go to school so badly.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-10 21:43:27	When students tweet complaining about school, they don't know what a privilege they have in free, daily rights to education.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-10 21:45:24	Just some food for thought. Whatever problems we face, it's all about perspective. We live in a nation of incredible access and privilege.

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-12 01:18:48	Biden (69) vs. Ryan (42). Hey, generation gap. The voter "heartbeat"(?) and speaking time tickets on CNN are kinda hilarious
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-12 01:29:43	I paused my TV twice already to rant to @Bass_Sick_Math about politic things, so my live tweets of the debates are a little delayed...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-12 20:08:12	@tween_sensation this is like the time Iran published an article from the onion as fact. I promise sarcasm/satire are covered in my hs class
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-11 20:04:30	@Megan_Browningg don't ever forget it!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-12 01:19:16	I love reality tv...I mean...political debates...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-12 01:22:10	"Undecided voters"...largely flatlined throughout from what I can tell...

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-12 01:28:08	Did the moderator just play "would you rather" with these gentlemen...?? #VPDebate
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-12 01:31:00	What if your name was "Grover Norquist"?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-12 01:32:58	Unemployment, statistics, hometown, debt, crisis, blahhhhhhh...PERSONAL ANTECDOTE PATHOS PATHOS, blahhhh
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-12 01:47:44	@Bass_Sick_Math realizing that Biden just referenced a time in his political career in which Ryan would've been...12 years old...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-12 01:59:27	@tween_sensation that. Widows. Peak. Yikes.

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-14 20:35:03	@Megan_Browningg depends on the focus you take. Initially, he is arrogant, hard-hearted, but transforms by the end, I think
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-14 21:06:30	@Megan_Browningg feel free to include me on your works cited page 😉
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-15 19:33:20	Glad to have you in class, too 😁 “@TheresaMarosy: i am so glad i had ms keck”

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-16 00:43:13	Been perplexed lately as to why some atheists spend so many tweets mocking a God they don't believe in. If He's not real, why bother?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-16 00:45:24	If He is real...why risk it? We could all benefit from a little more tolerance and respect of each other's differences
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-16 00:52:04	@Bass_Sick_Math OK SOUNDS GREAT
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-16 01:00:13	@ComedicLure no passive aggressiveness meant in any way. Simply an observation I've made from my TL lately, not directed at any one person.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-16 01:06:30	@ComedicLure exactly. we're all entitled to our opinions, myself included. Just contributing my 2 cents like everyone else...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-16 01:11:59	@ComedicLure of course there are! You of all people should know others share your opinions. Wasn't sub tweeting. I don't do that😉
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-16 01:15:48	@ComedicLure no worries! Was proud of the work you did last weekend, keep rising to your potential, you have a lot!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-16 01:19:21	@tween_sensation no sub tweets! Just sharing my opinions like everyone else! Equal opportunity to offend, express, etc...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-16 01:33:03	It's all good because God loves all of us. #unconditionallove. And I get to be thankful for that.

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-16 12:24:14	@KensiSharp26 it only got worse for me, walking or biking to class did not inspire cuteness haha
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-17 01:30:57	The only thing that could make this debate moderator more badass is if she was actually the "Candy" from #Intervention.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-17 01:34:30	@ComedicLure they artificial inflate their currency like wow. A pretty big issue, actually. Obama has also expressed big concerns w/China.

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-17 01:40:17	Obama referenced a bill he signed but simply said they "fixed it"... Not enough details for me, not reassuring
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-17 01:42:59	Romney doesn't directly address the wage discrepancy in any way...WHICH WAS THE QUESTION.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-17 01:45:24	Ok, Obama addressing important women's healthcare issues, bravo, however...STILL NOT WAGE DISCREPANCY. Sigh...

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-17 02:05:40	My word of caution is to never lean too far to one side. Objectivity is at the root of wisdom, understanding, and "true" information.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2012-10-17 02:09:12	Candidates just remembered there are people in the room besides each other that they should address occasionally lol

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-02-15 01:33:12	@TylerTheCreamer "~2.5".  The "~" means "approximately" or "an estimate" :)
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-02-15 01:35:30	OMG "~2.5" was an approximation, meant as a joke. being facetious. I am aware that half-people don't exist. GEEZ peeps :)

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-02-10 23:39:25	@HULKaba I e-mailed your rough draft back to you yesterday! check your school fusion messages
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-02-11 00:01:06	@CrossInverted true, but you're confused about teacher $$, haha. I'm technically not even getting paid to grade them outside school hours...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-02-11 00:28:02	@CrossInverted a slippery slope, indeed. I'll finish them, maybe even tonight, just with TSwift in the background :)
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-02-16 14:20:16	@HULKaba can't grade your essay until it includes research citations and a works cited page
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-02-16 14:27:50	@HULKaba I'll look for the email. Look in essay packet for instructions or examples if needed. It's on school fusion if you don't have it
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-02-16 14:31:51	@HULKaba as long as it's formatted correctly. MLA format. http://t.co/jg7ip98u helps with the works cited page

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-04-29 00:37:06	Seeing "Madness in the White City" after reading "Devil in the White City"...crazy history. Larson told it better, but cool to see visuals.

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-06 01:48:57	@HULKaba yay for education! Look it over a few times tonight, a few times in first block. You'll be fine
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-06 01:50:38	@HULKaba most people do, actually. Usually tougher than the real thing
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-06 01:52:30	@HULKaba sure thing
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-06 02:12:11	@BrianEHittman it's incredibly rewarding and NEVER boring :)
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-06 19:42:53	but really, though, Fleet Foxes.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-06 19:44:38	Celebrating a beasted EOC with Apples to Apples is always one of my favorite class days. Proud of my students!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-06 19:48:57	“@TylerTheCreamer: Points to @MrsAndreaTurner for making that EOC a piece of cake.” Points to you for making the knowledge/skills your own!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-06 20:01:12	@bedjmat225 excellent. I've been jamming Drops in the River.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-07 00:39:46	Watching classic office episodes with @Bass_Sick_Math after making a fantastic dinner. Rockin Monday Night.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-07 00:42:34	@GabrielleConner a common side effect of passing english II. Can be helped by visits to 216 and frequent independent reading 😊
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-06 01:45:19	@HULKaba making me real proud, kid
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-10 02:13:50	These last few #theoffice episodes are TEAR-JERKERS. Nostalgia overload: JAM, Dwangela, and Darrell dance party. 😂😭😅😩

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-16 19:46:13	Overall, pretty impressed with students' presentations today. Creative &amp; informative. Also, Project Cuddle is a real thing #themoreyouknow
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-16 19:50:37	@TylerTheCreamer yikes. False. Lesson learned: never trust student-recommended memes...

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-20 19:11:28	Still unsure as to how one can fail a class with unlimited re-submissions and no hard deadlines. But it happens every semester. #why
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-23 02:42:32	SVU SEASON FINALE HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?!  OLIVIAAAAAAAAAA. THERE WAS SO MUCH FORESHADOWING.

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-21 20:51:19	@TylerTheCreamer should've made an "A" in English...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-21 21:00:23	@TylerTheCreamer "effort" would have been turning in the last essay
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-23 23:36:02	@AlyJayde12321 this is a travesty. Make that bf fix it. Cheddar bay biscuits are a life-changing experience.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-24 00:27:14	Criminal Minds season finale was pretty excellent, too. #zugzwang
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-24 00:30:14	And let's be real, sad for Rossi but nobody really liked Strauss all that much.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-24 00:32:37	Also...I only thought Gatsby was ok. #confessions. I love some Jay-Z and DeCaprio but...yea, book was better. Always is.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-24 00:34:49	@_TylerJones true! Hope it's going well! Sorry I didn't make it out 😬
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-26 02:19:49	@KerstinNoire it's up to you, miss high school grad :)
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-24 16:40:22	Mr. Trent left with the class he began with. He's doing what's best for his family and himself. Honored to have known and worked with him.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-05-24 16:41:36	He's returning to his true love and passion, which is middle school. We were lucky to have his influence at CHS and I wish him the best.

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-06-10 14:48:45	@bjonesatcentral @CodaHall yes, that's correct! Honors eng and ap government will likely be during 3rd, they will alternate days year-long

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-06-10 18:22:35	lol at my summer bridge students trying to teach me how to "twerk it". I tried to steer the convo into a discussion of etymology...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-06-10 18:23:58	"twerk it" = "to" and "work it"?
or a portmanteau of "twist" and "jerk"?  #mysteries
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-06-10 18:34:29	@CodaHall one week may be eng: mon/wed/fri, ap gov: tue/thur, then the next week would switch. You'll know in advance as school year starts
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-06-11 00:44:36	@CodaHall checked out your summer reading yet? Our two dystopian novels are kinda awesome

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-06-16 20:24:55	Needing to purge anything from your stomach? Try listening to that Yeezus business. Good grief, it's awful.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-06-16 20:28:55	Who's excited for some Hillary Clinton selfies?

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-06-18 02:56:10	"Spirit in the Sky". Yep.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-06-24 18:25:37	The TV in the social security office keeps looping a graphic of a clown fish chasing a social security card

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-06-24 18:27:03	Also YOU BETTER BRING ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS UP IN HERE, NO COPIES. Real strict about that. I am prepared #namechange only 3 months late...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-06-24 18:28:24	This place is SO SMELLY. Live tweet your name-change visit to the social security office.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-06-24 18:30:17	Did I mention the smell? Now the bald eagle is driving a moving van. It's almost my turn
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-06-24 18:37:22	Done! My person was so quick and helpful! My twitter name is now officially legal :)
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-11 16:34:39	@HULKaba "dat" moment? Really?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-14 02:34:20	Go read a book! Let me know if you need recommendations.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-14 03:01:34	@Melly_Shih two young adult authors, everything they've written is awesome: Markus Zuskak and John Green
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-14 03:02:35	@Melly_Shih ALSO...classic american literature: East of Eden (Steinbeck) and A Farewell to Arms (Hemmingway). My two personal faves :)
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-14 03:04:18	@Melly_Shih *hemingway. happy reading!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-14 03:14:06	@Melly_Shih Any time!  If you read any of them, let me know what you think!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-19 17:46:33	@very_v234 Miss you, too! That dress was stunning :)
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-19 17:49:16	GETTING PUMPED FOR NEW GRAMMAR, LITERACY, AND SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGIES UP IN MY CLASSROOM!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-19 17:51:00	Who's ready to make twitter accounts for literary characters and tweet from their POV's as we study texts in class?  #Literacy
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-19 17:52:07	Who's reading an awesome book this summer?  What makes it awesome?  I've read #gonegirl and #thenaziofficerswife
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-19 17:55:03	@A_lyssaaa The Things They Carried is incredible.  Some mature themes and language, but an amazing account of soldiers at war.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-19 17:55:55	@A_lyssaaa I became emotional more than once when I read it.  True accounts from soldiers in Vietnam.  Haven't read Purple Heart.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-19 17:57:34	@A_lyssaaa good for you!  It's so important to challenge yourself. It will be difficult, but so worthwhile. I'm here for ya.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-19 18:00:40	@A_lyssaaa Junior year is usually the hardest, but it's great that future colleges will see you are challenging yourself with those classes.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-19 18:01:26	@A_lyssaaa Now, it will take 20-30 pages to get invested in The Things They Carried, so be patient :)
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-19 18:01:58	@A_lyssaaa B's and C's in honors classes are more impressive to a college than A's in regular class. #truth
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-19 18:06:00	@A_lyssaaa don't be afraid to work hard! you'll be fine
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-27 20:04:46	reading about #newchristieleans2k13 has been the highlight of my twitter week
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-28 16:05:20	askfm seems like a HORRIBLE, PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE, COWARDLY IDEA. Just ask someone a question like a normal person.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-28 16:06:18	Also, I'm really tired of reading all the askfm tweets. Why is it all connected? Feeling old, over-socialmedia-ized.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-28 16:09:53	@HULKaba what? I didn't need askfm to help me develop a thick skin to anonymous insults. In fact, anonymous insults are rare in real life...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-28 16:12:38	@HULKaba I believe that. I'm just saying it seems silly to me. But again, I'm old, so..
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-28 16:14:17	Also, upcoming sophomores, I'm only teaching one semester section of honors english, and it's in the spring. No more year-long paired class.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-28 18:30:26	Seek peace and pursue it. Psalm 34:14.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-30 00:36:06	oh, #everafter, you are my childhood.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-07-31 01:08:15	@boatse @tween_sensation @chichimalcolm hidin' corn starch like it's crack. French fry mom was a hot mess.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-02 03:43:28	@HULKaba usually 3. Many undergrads get their BA in English, just so you know!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-03 02:57:10	@CodaHall Yes!  Spread the word!  Got the official revised schedule today.  It'll be fourth block year round and it will be awesome.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-03 03:19:39	@bjonesatSTEM @CodaHall hahaha, all good convos for class this year!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-03 23:09:57	Netflix took away the last seasons of The Office. Distraught and lost, @Bass_Sick_Math and I have no choice but to dive into Breaking Bad.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-03 23:11:57	I know Breaking Bad will be excellent (NPR is always right), but Netflix took The Office away from me and I'll probably never forgive them.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-02 00:44:35	#tbt @KensiSharp26 cheers to my beginning years of teaching and a new year officially as Mrs. Turner :) http://t.co/orQtjTWV3B
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-02 00:51:36	@sandirobertson how about collaborating with me? getting honors kids ready for AP? Was thinking today about "weekly critiques" you mentioned
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-02 00:53:11	@sandirobertson twitter doesn't give enough room, but I'm excited to work with you! Been working to get my year-long class back on schedule!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-02 00:54:18	@sandirobertson also a big secret I plan to bring next week is that common core can/might make lesson planning easier?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-02 00:56:22	@BrinksFultonLMC yay!!! My favorite librarian!!!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-02 00:59:17	@sandirobertson I'm pumped to critique distopian lit, govt structures, current events, all the things! And maybe some grammar somewhere...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-02 03:48:33	@HULKaba if by "different" you mean "more difficult", then yes.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-02 03:51:25	@HULKaba the easy way is never as worthwhile. Make sure it's what you really want, then the work feels meaningful.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-02 20:42:50	P.S. #1984 is a terrifying book. Interested to have conversations about the idea of #newspeak in particular, esp in light of twitter/texting
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-03 14:53:36	@bjonesatSTEM LOVE IT! Wanna pass it along when you're done?  What texts are you using?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-03 02:44:40	@BrianEHittman Exodus is my favorite album.  named my sweet pup after him!

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-12 14:31:46	@werewolfe_ quit crying about summer reading and give it a chance. The debates/political discussions will be awesome!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-12 14:38:41	@werewolfe_  ...just don't drop the class. You are perfectly capable and you'll be glad you pushed yourself.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-12 14:39:16	@werewolfe_ also, if it was "The Things They Carried", it's an amazing book and you would like it.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-12 21:45:23	A heartfelt thanks to students who come to class w/positive attitudes and appreciate teachers' hard work to help them have a successful year
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-12 21:52:32	“Anger...it's a paralyzing emotion...you can't get anything done. People sort of think it's an interesting, passionate, and igniting feeling
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-12 21:53:09	...I don't think it's any of that — it's helpless...it's absence of control—and I need all of my skills, all of the control, all of my power
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-12 21:53:20	...and anger doesn't provide any of that — I have no use for it whatsoever."  Toni Morrison
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-12 21:56:13	@AlyJayde12321 Thanks, Alyssa. We'll just have to start book club back up! Thursday mornings?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-12 22:47:20	@sandirobertson I think you're a rock star!🎸🎤
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-13 21:37:17	DIR intro's went over SO well today! 1st blk already asking for more time! #independentreading with #purpose &amp; #passion 📖😍📚
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-18 13:15:13	Didn't see any panicked student emails about school fusion because I had a bike wreck yesterday and went to bed at 8:30 #sorrykids
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-18 13:17:09	But all is well! All essays will still be accepted ASAP via email or Dropbox. I'll be grading &amp; bandaging my wounds for the rest of the day
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-18 13:19:41	RT those updates if you know any of my current honors students. Fusion is back up and I sent messages there, as well. Happy Sunday!

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-16 16:43:23	I'll climb a mountain of ~100 essays this wkend, but had a fantastic 1st week back! #bobcatpride for students rising to challenges of #CCSS
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-19 22:14:00	4th blk students clearly outlined differences between totalitarianism and imperialism in our discussion on Orwell/1984. Color me #impressed.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-19 22:38:20	Another mature observation by a student today: Orwell promoted criticism of authority. However...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-19 22:38:48	There is an important difference between constructive, intelligent criticism and blatant or offensive complaining.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-19 22:46:15	Overall, it's exciting to watch current and former students maturing and rising to new academic challenges.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-19 23:29:05	First fall rehearsal: New music for the new season! #knoxchoralsociety #soprano2 http://t.co/wyFKlAZt33

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-20 00:49:06	@bjonesatSTEM students thought Orwell personally fell into the former, but displayed both in the novel
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-20 00:50:11	@bjonesatSTEM the former is more thoughtful, respectful discourse, the latter is concerned only with the sound of one's own voice
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-20 00:50:43	@HULKaba @bjonesatSTEM evidence? What have you read of his, Matt?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-20 00:53:54	@HULKaba @bjonesatSTEM could there be rhetorical or stylistic rationale for repetition?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-20 00:57:08	@HULKaba @bjonesatSTEM perhaps, never been my favorite but his predictions in 1984 continue to be relevant and prophetic #NSA #thoughtpolice
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-20 01:06:46	@HULKaba seriously...?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-08-20 16:33:12	I love the sound of the marching band practicing outside my classroom window! Makes me excited for all things fall and football 🐾🍁🎺🎷🎵🏈⛺

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2013-10-08 00:11:55	Studying MLK Jr.'s rhetoric, going to hot yoga, grilling out for husband, and singing at rehearsal have made for a solid Monday 📖☀️🍛🎼🎶😊

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-02 16:06:36	4TH BLK: WE WILL BE IN MCDANIEL'S ROOM AND ROOM 103 DUE TO TESTING IN LIBRARY. Yes, that means most of you will be handwriting the essay 😬📝
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-02 19:44:53	For those in 4th blk who came fully prepared, it did not go unnoticed.  I will likely build in a brief extension/revision to our essay today
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-02 20:59:52	Sincere, unsolicited feedback from students about how much they learn in my classroom means more than any evaluation or test score. #tgif
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-05 13:45:45	PLEASE PLEASE WATCH THIS. PLEASE PLEASE STOP TANNING. It's just not worth it. https://t.co/WABmEkPLfO
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-05 22:05:49	@metropulse Call me crazy, but couldn't @votestacey criticize federal healthcare policy WITHOUT alluding to tyranny and horrific genocide?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-05 19:33:45	Like I need an excuse to eat Mexican... #chipsandsalsaeveryday

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-10 01:04:25	To my students - past, present, and future: Work for a cause, not for applause. Live life to express, not to impress...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-10 01:04:38	...Don't strive to make your presence noticed, just make your absence felt.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-15 21:50:45	@TheAlygator_ Can I make this a classroom poster?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-14 23:21:30	@WorldOfLanaDRey @Ariel_Courtney_ Lana might've said this, but should cite her source; it's a famous quote from a woman named Erma Bombeck.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-16 19:31:29	EOC SCORES ARE IN. Come by my room if you want to see yours
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-16 20:15:41	@HULKaba @jadaleawilliams @RMoncier you've come so far since that day. It must've pushed you in the right directions 😜

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-15 11:56:23	The class of 2014 was my first at CHS as sophomores! It is a bittersweet moment to watch them begin an exciting new chapter today. #DFTBA
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-17 20:36:05	A perfect Saturday - bike ride, beverage, book. http://t.co/feWOLgrNRK

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-16 16:09:19	@jadaleawilliams that was a terrible idea! 😵😯😶

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-19 19:09:17	Are @HULKaba and Abbey coming to my 4th block tomorrow to judge folktales?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-19 19:49:00	@HULKaba @Naww217 will be SO disappointed!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-05-21 00:31:55	@kdustin307 ok, the sooner the better!

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-06-23 01:22:49	Being a UTK fan here lately, tonight's tie was still satisfying.  Can't say I was even surprised when the last goal happened #volprobs
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-06-23 02:41:11	@werewolfe_ BOTH.

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-07-27 01:13:50	Summer break is no excuse to forget the difference between your/you're 😐
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-07-29 15:21:18	@HULKaba Poe wins only because he invented the genre and was pretty creepy even in real life. Funny stuff! I could *almost* show it in class
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-07-29 15:44:01	@HULKaba Nice! It was well-written, nicely performed.

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-08-02 23:45:59	@HULKaba yes, how soon will you need it?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-08-02 23:48:05	@HULKaba That's a great strategy, good for you! If I haven't gotten to it in a few weeks just remind me.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-08-04 20:58:58	First day back - Honored to be working for Mr. Reynolds this year. I admire his passion for servant leadership and high expectations.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-08-04 21:01:30	You can't grow and improve without change; I hope our students come back with open minds and high hopes for what they can achieve this year!

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-08-09 18:54:40	But seriously, I have so many new books and everyone who thinks reading is the worst will get to realize that it's actually AWESOME.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-08-09 19:00:18	@CodaHall were you one of the "leaves it under the desk" type?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-08-12 22:10:34	Glad @sarah_browningg set me straight today. To my fellow millennials: "Peeps"(referring to friends) is no longer a thing. #rippeeps

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-08-11 23:29:31	Needless to say, I'll be finding room for "Dead Poets Society" in the curriculum this year. So, so, sad.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-08-11 23:47:56	@HULKaba @bjonesatLNSTEM I just can't believe you're a senior! We'll both be there in May sharing a tissue box. Also, come visit Journalism!

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-08-27 22:38:10	@jadaleawilliams I think I've fixed them! The web version was in all caps and we didn't pay as close attention to proper noun caps.

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-04 22:40:57	@HULKaba Warrant Officer Johnston can give you an account for free online ACT prep - you should check it out!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-04 22:43:52	@HULKaba Our ROTC teacher at school, he sent an announcement today for anyone who was interested in free ACT prep.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-04 22:46:54	@HULKaba At any rate, it's a free resource if you want it.  No reason you shouldn't do well on that test!
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-04 22:49:09	@HULKaba before/after school, lunch, class change, just stop by the ROTC room and he can give you instructions.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-04 22:56:43	Discovering @MrDerekNoakes on Netflix and following @rickygervais on Twitter are two of my best decisions as of late.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-05 01:21:23	@Ariel_Courtney_ I had purple highlights last January :)
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-05 01:41:50	@Ariel_Courtney_ It washed out after a month or so for me, but then I just had blonde highlights underneath after that.

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-07 23:27:12	@HULKaba this was the email I received: Dear Andrea Keck Turner,
Your online recommendation for Matthew Huckaba has been received.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-09 01:43:51	@HULKaba what would you like me to do? They sent me a confirmation email
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-09 01:48:34	@HULKaba Good ol' UTK. They make everything really easy, in my experience #verbalirony
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-11 00:28:05	Just heard about all of Gilmore Girls coming soon to a Netflix near me. #whoneedscable
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-11 01:20:30	Also watched Obama's address because I assigned my honors class the task of a rhetorical analysis chart in response to his remarks.
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-11 01:23:32	Watched our President's address and wished he had named our Allies. Who exactly is helping the US in the fight against ISIS?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-11 01:27:49	@kdustin307 which is nice, but who are they?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-11 01:40:39	@HULKaba @werewolfe_ It's all about identifying appeals and how they are supported. What details were given/omitted? For what purposes?
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-11 01:41:52	@Tornado_Aly I hope that was a first, because I was pretty proud of it :)
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-11 01:53:43	@Tornado_Aly I knew what you meant ;)
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-11 01:55:19	Interesting point made about the avoidance of the word "war", not considering "air strikes" to be "combat" #rhetoric #diction #Obama

20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-11 02:02:27	Some pundits remarking that this was not "the second term Obama wanted." Tell that to FDR, LBJ, GWBush, etc. Not really how that works...
20746137	MrsAndreaTurner	2014-09-11 02:04:19	@TheOrangeBobcat Couldn't agree more!  John Green is always a solid, entertaining choice.
