207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-25 02:21:03	@Shakabrodie What happened? Out for the year?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-24 19:21:29	Watch despite being the leading scorer in NCAA the Leafs will put Casey Bailey on a line with Zach Sill and Joakim Lidstrom &amp; play him 10min
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-24 19:22:33	@teesang Crossword puzzles?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-24 19:24:48	Just realized Marty Brodeur has 7 kids with 2 women who are sisters, so he's his kids uncle too #randomthoughts

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-24 20:32:49	@nympsam Sorry sorry I had video games on my own mind when I tweeted you. How's things otherwise?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-25 13:13:14	@Taylor_Sabrina Oh nice! How's the food in Bali compare to Thailand? Also still drinking epic beers?

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-25 16:16:16	@Michael_Traikos @jonasTSN1050 Oh too late in the season? Also what number will he be wearing?

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-25 17:04:25	@LottOnBaseball What does the bullpen look like for you? Does Delabar for sure make the team out of camp now that Jenkins is down?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-25 17:05:11	@Cosmopolitan @AwesomeJennJenn Did he get the second date?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-25 17:15:20	@AwesomeJennJenn @Cosmopolitan Haha if his second date isn't saving a puppy I'm not sure how he'll top first date LOL

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-26 17:13:57	@CaseP Awesome! Were you ever Iphone or always Android?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-26 17:17:30	@CaseP Ah true, yeah I was going to ask you how it compares. I've had the same IPhone for 4 years. Think I need an upgrade soon.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-26 02:33:51	@The_Jmoney Is it less heavy / thick?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-26 02:50:02	@The_Jmoney Ah brutal, just from a flavour suggestion, I recommend adding cinnamon I find it makes shakes more appealing
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-26 17:45:23	@jet79 Deathwish Series from the 80s was epic...is Liam Neeson the modern day Bronson?

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-26 19:36:07	22 Jump Street hoping for a 28 Jump Street
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-26 03:09:23	@mariuch25 As long as they win in the playoffs it's all that matters. I wonder if they don't get out of round 1 does Casey get fired? #RTZ
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-26 03:13:10	@ruhee_ @imogenjmb This Del Duca guy must not be living in Toronto/ deal with many people if he believes that. No offence to him
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-26 03:15:49	@mariuch25 I guess 1 more year can't hurt, it's crazy how different this team looks when Lowry isn't in the lineup. But is that coaching?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-26 03:33:04	@mariuch25 Yeah, as a Clippers fan living in Toronto I want to see Clippers v Raps in Finals, but I think that's a year or two off if at all

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 01:51:13	@NBomb Shakey Graves fan? @Toolzchick
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 02:27:02	@FScottHolla It's like the one guy at the bar who thinks he can out drink Superman...fool doesn't know what he's in for
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 02:33:03	@FScottHolla Ha that's fair, the question is how much will this loss be by?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 02:36:58	@FScottHolla Was WVU the team where the coaches daughters got really offensive with the Maryland player?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 02:50:51	@FScottHolla Yeah the kicker was he was completely cleared by a Grand Jury people take taunting too far.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 22:59:02	@BangBangLampley Yeah had 5 slices of the 8 it came as. Well worth it. Going to go jog in a bit @corey_erdman
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 03:26:00	@BNosanchuk Super jealous, who do you have winning the IC Title Sunday?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 03:27:58	@BNosanchuk Yeah that's my sense too, he's been made to look the strongest. You think Rollins ruins Reigns Wrestlemania Moment?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 03:29:37	@FScottHolla WVU won't get over half court ever if it's up to UK haha. Is your bracket still going strong man?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 03:32:24	@BNosanchuk Yeah then get curb stomped by Rollins who then wins the title and gets destroyed by Brock at his next appearance Summer Slam LOL
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 03:55:37	@FScottHolla Yeah it's been rough, I picked Kentucky over Louisville, with Wisconsin and UCLA being the other two teams in Final Four
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 23:24:11	@AmandaBlake9: I need beer, and that is all.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 23:26:46	@TheProgJR Fat no way you're like Chuck Norris you flex and you're back to normal weight
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 23:27:20	@AmandaBlake9 Ha I was trying to fix yours so it looked like you said it but then I got thirsty lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 23:29:36	Just bodied half a pizza after crushing a workout earlier dilemma to beer or not to beer to cap off the evening? Also more push-ups right?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 23:33:58	@beermostly I found out recently I can't handle dark beers, get super sick but IPAs I seem to be fine with. Good advice
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 23:38:50	@jet79 Imagine he comes to Raptors?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 23:57:14	@jet79 Why the snarkiness? More importantly you have time for pre fatherhood beers?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-27 23:58:04	@beermostly @ladiesdrinkbeer You bartending for them?

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-28 22:45:23	@beermostly @bellwoodsbeer How much alcohol in that one?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 04:11:07	@FScottHolla Bray Wyatt v Undertaker came one right as Daryl &amp; Aaron got stuck in the car by Zombies &amp; Wyatt came out w/ Zombies for match!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 04:11:46	@FScottHolla Wyatt's gimmick is that he's the new 'deadman' so instead of druids he had zombies walk the aisle with him v Undertaker
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 04:13:41	@WhitneyMayes Babies?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 04:15:37	@FScottHolla that first tweet should have read as "came on right as Daryl &amp; Aaron got trapped in car by zombies"
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-29 14:03:30	@beermostly what's kandi and what does it have to do with drinking epic beer?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-29 01:25:53	I hate how every time it looks like a fight will break out the officials jump in and break it up, NHL's killed the emotion in its games #TML
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-29 01:27:11	Does all this scoring by Bozak increase his trade value? #Leafs
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-29 01:38:51	@Ben_T_Johnson Will it turn into a beer and bourbon chat at any point? Also how did that go with beerworking?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-29 01:40:20	LEAFS!!! Eat it Sens! Bozak first hatty of career that's huge!

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-29 01:52:42	@SariClancy Yeah being Leafs fans but wanting Ottawa to win feels just wrong. Garrett's the man!

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 17:16:21	With @timandsid leaving radio I need a new show for 1-4 in the afternoon any suggestions?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 17:20:45	@Joe_17 @Toolzchick is one of my favourite Twitter people
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 17:22:16	@Joe_17 @Toolzchick You're both in the top 5 I'd make a list but my ego isn't that big LOL

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 17:24:09	@DeborahKanfer That's so cool! Also been a while, are you still making epic jewellery?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 01:21:00	Anyone on here read Three Cheers or @DoodleBrews24 with regularity? What would you like to see written about on either blog? #Blogchat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 01:30:15	Maggie and Glenn look like they're on outs #WalkingDead
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 01:31:10	@NBomb I've said this to everyone who's seen it, I feel like the fact he wiped out the entire bloodline for taking out his dog was very fair
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 01:37:23	@CaseP @NBomb @AwesomeJennJenn Wait what'd I do? I'm confused? What's the rage? Don't make me bust out "baby come back" by Player
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 01:38:37	@CaseP @NBomb @AwesomeJennJenn Ah I'd never block the 3 of you, I mean maybe Nick, but like we go for wings too often haha I mean wait what?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 01:40:12	@CaseP @AwesomeJennJenn @NBomb Speaking of trolled I felt like Charles Bronson in Deathwish last night, took on Queens hipster scene LOL

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 01:43:58	@AwesomeJennJenn Is this like Super Bowl rituals? If he doesn't like AYCE wings throw him to the bushes :)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 01:45:43	@NBomb @CaseP @AwesomeJennJenn Ouch! Haters hating?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 01:48:27	@AwesomeJennJenn Hahaha, ah that's fair!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 01:49:11	@Freeroll4life Still worth seeing? Did you end up seeing Run All Night?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 01:58:43	Ronda Rousey is a boss! #Wrestlemania
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 02:00:53	Get Him Glenn Get him! #WalkingDead
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 02:03:32	The Bray Wyatt Zombies while I'm watching Walking Dead, might be the trippiest thing I've seen in wrestling in a while #ManiaDead
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 02:07:07	@stlouisatrium @YashYanthi Not sure these days, like 8 years ago maybe 50 lol. Now not sure.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 02:13:59	@TomMcAuliffe Think that was planned or are we over thinking it?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 02:17:54	@jet79 Great track
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 02:29:20	HOLY SMOKES #WalkingDead &amp; Bray v Taker was Outstanding #Mania

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 17:36:22	@keely4204 @momnhops I want to see a Mom N Hops Store and a Keeeeely IPA and an E Stout, I think it can happen in Quebec?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 17:38:13	@The_Jmoney @TheRoostKitchen Dang it J that looks epic! Please tell me you had 12?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 17:38:58	@HeidyMo Got those dance shoes to rock out to the epic tunes?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 17:42:39	@The_Jmoney @TheRoostKitchen Fried chicken and cheese sounds insanely delicious
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 17:44:03	@clickflickca That's what I'm gathering/ hesitant about seeking advice from a job councillor. Thinking of doing a Twitter campaign instead!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 17:44:41	@AwesomeJennJenn @OneKingWest Are you hitting @beerbistroTO first before your visit to one King?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 17:45:55	@The_Jmoney @TheRoostKitchen Oh man that's insane. Ps Mania was top notch &amp; Ronda Rousey is stunning
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 17:47:34	@clickflickca Thanks Jo, I'll give them both a try. Do you recommend anyone?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 17:51:15	@clickflickca No trouble!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 17:51:50	@AwesomeJennJenn @OneKingWest @beerbistroTO @mpibeers Ah jealous I wanted to attend but Passover means no beers for a week starting Friday
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 02:43:09	@jet79 Yeah said nothing since 2007 when that album came out. Crazy to think they just didn't decide to go indie for a bit.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 02:58:33	OMG SETH ROLLINS IS WWE CHAMPION! #MANIA
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 17:52:22	@The_Jmoney Yeah the only thing I'd pass on is Sting v Triple H that was brutal
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 03:46:46	@FScottHolla Man this was actually the first episode I watched all season. Counting on your recaps allowed me to stay up to speed haha.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 03:47:31	@FScottHolla But yeah when Carroll gets in Pete's face or whatever I was like about effin time...no idea how Glenn survived walker sandwich
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 03:57:18	@FScottHolla Man I feel like you should work for AMC since your recaps are next level.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 04:01:33	@FScottHolla hahaha I just see for this one "So Rick still looks like Ric Flair after a cage match...you know bleeding all over the place"
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 04:04:02	I'm curious to know how many people unfollow me after seeing these random Zoolander and Chuck Norris tweets?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 04:05:16	@FScottHolla Oh man same for the most part. I was watching Wrestlemania 31 on my computer while watching the Walking Dead Finale was bananas
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 18:34:17	@AwesomeJennJenn @OneKingWest @beerbistroTO @mpibeers Haha yeah, I'll live vicariously through your pictures :)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 18:35:30	@The_Jmoney I thought for a year off from TNA he looked decent, having Hogan bump for XPac though was kind of odd
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 18:36:33	@DeborahKanfer Wicked! My mum still wears the necklace I bought from you thanks again few years later :)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 18:36:56	@NBomb @AwesomeJennJenn @CalvinHtut @CaseP @clickflickca Now we need a wing based tweet up lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 18:38:23	@CalvinHtut @NBomb @AwesomeJennJenn @CaseP @clickflickca I'm Jewish but sure!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 18:44:07	@NBomb @CalvinHtut @AwesomeJennJenn @CaseP @clickflickca All you need is the 6 of us for wings and no Buddhist not yet at least!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 19:39:18	@TomMcAuliffe Ah that's fair. I'm a fan of your show photos man. Hope all is well otherwise!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 20:57:57	@stlouisatrium @LeighTiffany @Hey_itsG 79? That's exceptional was that recent? How many can you handle Ginny  and Tiffany?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 21:10:50	@SoundOfSexton They need a like option for tweets like this, that was outstanding/ like worthy
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 22:49:44	@BeerGirlCA Beer Judging? That's wicked cool!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 22:52:13	@BeerGirlCA Did I get the wicked cool part right at least? 😬
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-31 17:32:16	@AwesomeJennJenn @SmoqueNBones Oh snap that's a lot of epicness, can you come and join me AJJ?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-31 17:43:30	@clickflickca Gift card has arrived! Thanks again for letting me participate in #RandomChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-31 17:43:59	@AwesomeJennJenn @SmoqueNBones Yeah I'm sure we can scrounge up a few people :P
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 13:19:26	@Moketronics You build one of those Star Trek beam to another planet devices?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 13:22:37	@Moketronics Yeah transporter lol I just woke up so brain isn't functioning haha. That'd be epic if they ever actually get made though
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 13:25:59	@Moketronics Haha yeah. Actually though the transporter seemed like a waste of time since aliens could beam right to bridge during battles
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 13:26:25	@Moketronics In the Star Treks I mean re aliens beam to bridge.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 13:28:09	You know you're too glued to a radio show when you know specific times to avoid or tune in w/out looking at show schedule /day
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 13:30:31	@Moketronics Yeah in Voyager it seemed like the Borg could get through anything. Did you ever watch Enterprise with Scott Bakula as captain?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 13:37:59	@Moketronics Yeah I was the same but that was more because I was in school at the time so no chance to watch.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 13:41:08	@AndrewStoeten Would it be too cliche if Devon Travis walk up music is a Devo song? Before you block me who's your darkhorse for a breakout?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 13:45:03	@AndrewStoeten I guess Smoak being more than a platoon guy possibly could be a dark horse story.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 13:48:08	@The_Jmoney was watching the #my2cents vids last night are you bringing those back? Brilliant videos man
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 13:48:54	@clickflickca That's like chips bet you can't eat just one?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 13:52:36	@clickflickca Just remember not even Chuck Norris can have one Dorito
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 13:54:52	@CPantazis Yo just watched your VEDA day 1 awesome stuff! I'd do it to but no video skills haha. Also congrats on the job that's awesome!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 14:05:47	@CPantazis Oh true re IPhone! Well you're an awesome person so people will be happy to get to know you.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 14:25:01	Need motivation to hit my gym instead of workout at home...any tips?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 14:26:36	@CalvinHtut The longer version still makes them look bad. Like why'd the second officer with goatee have to punch the guy in the face?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 14:28:20	@nympsam Haha thanks! Yeah I work out at a community centre instead of Goodlife so I get bored when I go sometimes. I'll go though thanks :)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 14:34:03	@CalvinHtut Right, but if you watch the video younger guy was cooperating with goatee when goatee went Boxer on him.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 14:34:44	@nympsam Thanks Sam that's solid advice, I appreciate it! Heading over now! Hope all is well on your end?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 14:35:08	@BangBangLampley Getting up!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 15:47:06	Thanks everyone that hollered to get to the gym was an epic workout...appreciate the support #hulkout
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 15:49:11	@CalvinHtut Right yeah I saw that. But it seemed like things were under control when he &amp; goatee were talking &amp; then goatee slugged him
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 15:50:09	@CalvinHtut Cont'd having watched it again maybe they exchanged words goatee and young guy and then goatee punched him in face
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 15:50:40	@BecomingVintage Ha that's awesome man I need to find one for sure!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 15:51:06	@BecomingVintage @Emi_the_Rose @Moketronics Oh man that's great news, happy for you Robert! Where in BC?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 15:52:34	@Moketronics @BecomingVintage @Emi_the_Rose Oh right missed it! Dang jealous, I want to go to beer or wine school like Robert did!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 17:10:36	@CalvinHtut Agree jobs wise
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 17:11:40	@Emi_the_Rose @Moketronics @BecomingVintage Cicerone I've been intrigued with I'd be down for either, let me know when it's "pay them time"
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 17:13:21	@The_Jmoney Yeah as a fan of your work it's something I'd tune into
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 23:45:54	@BeerGirlCA Ah that's epic, next time I decide to leave the house I'll try and visit you #workfromhome
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 23:50:20	Better pop than Mountain Dew original? I can be swayed but I'm saying its número Uno in the pop drinking debate what say you Twitter pals?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-30 23:51:10	Also my photo is of Charles Bronson in Deathwish 1 in case anyone thinks I aged and grew an epic moustache
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-31 00:07:17	@BangBangLampley Coke hurts my stomach but I see your argument and raise you fake Mountain Dew is delicious!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-31 01:15:16	Who did Brock kill with that second F5? #WWE
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-31 23:57:05	Leafs up 2-0 on Tampa...apocalypse?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-03-31 01:57:27	@corey_erdman Corey they need you in there man, Saxton needs a co-announcer with Cole out.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 00:47:25	It pains me every time Kessel and JVR try to set up Bozak instead of you know shoot the puck and score themselves #Leafs #Pains
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 00:52:13	@Toolzchick Wow that's an epic review...now i'm hungry again after dinner :P
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 01:01:09	@Toolzchick Yeah definitely! Also good to see you on Yelp, your writing is great to see :)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 01:03:37	@AThibert @Ben_T_Johnson Id say both, there's a few I have stacked in my fridge but i'm always down to grab the newest beers too #OnBeerchat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 01:06:52	Anyone giving away Salads as prizes on their hashtag chats? These last two wins were Pizza and Wings trying to clean up eating #GreenChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-02 02:34:26	@FScottHolla Sounds good I'm always around haha.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-02 02:36:16	@JennAndTheCity You're a doll first? haha. Thanks for the kind words. Completely random question George Michael or Bon Jovi? Better cheese?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-02 02:37:09	@Shakabrodie Wait you're an A's fan, Leafs fan and own an epic beard? Are we long lost doppelgangers who can't have nice things beside beard
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-02 02:37:51	This is your weekly George Michael is the man tweet cc: @JohnPaulFutbol @jet79
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 02:20:13	@real_JJ JJ Crawford?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 02:21:55	@beermostly Go for a run
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 02:23:09	@beermostly Switch to IPAs?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 02:31:10	10:30 at night, Leafs won, should I go for a run in celebration? #Eveningrun
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 03:02:21	@wewritebeer I've sadly been holding off joining for one of these because I'm intimidated. I ran a 5K race couple wks ago 37:47 too slow?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 03:03:03	@BangBangLampley Man I probably should, I'm looking at being a personal trainer...so should look the part lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 03:05:40	@NBomb Who should run things NB?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 03:06:30	@jet79 I'll read them on your behalf in trade for @bellwoodsbeer fair trade?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 03:27:46	@jet79 I'll mark them and listen to August Burns Red?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 03:31:02	@CPantazis I've got a beard for radio but possibly in August...how's things?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-01 03:37:42	@CPantazis Soup!!

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-06 02:43:06	@MDee14 It'll never happen but somehow trading for Malkin without giving up Reilley or the 1st rounder this June would be incredible

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-06 02:49:25	@MDee14 Oh I know, but as a Leafs homer I was tying it back haha. Imagine though Kessel Malkin JVR
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-06 02:51:15	@JennAndTheCity Hahah skills, as for hopeless romanticism I'm the same way but for Leafs instead of relationships haha :)

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-03 03:38:28	@The_Jmoney Yeah man &amp; agree Flash is pretty solid, I need to be sold on Shield just can't get into it at all. Arrow is fantastic though.

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 01:48:46	@efronb Is Vida Blue pitching tonight?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 01:52:10	@efronb I'm expecting big things from that Henderson kid in left field, he's going to be a hall of famer or something I hear
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 02:18:09	@efronb Sorry wasn't meant to be mocking, what do you think of this year's squad though? Going to suck when they deal Gray b/c A's
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 02:26:05	@efronb Yeah they'll need to play small ball a lot this year just to get guys on, hopefully not strike out too much. You think playoffs?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 02:35:25	@mirtle They would win out these last two games just to annoy the media and kill the souls of the diehard fans hoping for McDavid or Strome
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 17:04:44	@FScottHolla thoughts? https://t.co/6ditqvqCz5
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 17:30:45	@FScottHolla Yeah the style of offence he's run at West Ham and formerly Wolves or Bolton is really typical for middle teams not contenders
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 17:31:15	@FScottHolla Like he'd be gone midseason for you guys if it ever happened.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 17:33:23	@Joe_17 What's the deal with that Cauz tweet earlier? Did he get in trouble?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 17:39:47	@Joe_17 Ohh. I thought he got the boot for Wheeler...but your first tweet didn't sound that angered so I was unsure
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 19:31:09	@FScottHolla Yeah certainly. But his days have been numbered for basically 2 years. Some of the losses this year were unacceptable though
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 19:31:55	@FScottHolla For instance how do you lose 3-1 to QPR and 2-1 to Leiscter City and still expect to keep your job?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-06 22:02:25	@by_simone If I got married in my 20s I'd be on wife 5 by 30s lol. I'm 26 no wife yet haha

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 22:17:31	@JennAndTheCity Its you though I'm sure whatever you wear you'll look awesome! I guess steakhouse wise that's nice pants not stretchies :)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 22:18:45	@beermostly You should have a background of some epic places you've never been while drinking beers #photoshopbrews

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-07 13:35:41	.@CaseP I don't know his actual name without looking it up so I would say it to his face! #dudelesson
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-07 13:36:33	@JennAndTheCity I'm in the wrong business
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-07 13:50:00	@JennAndTheCity What would you do with that much $$?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-07 14:00:00	@JennAndTheCity You my friend are a saint! I'd likely get myself &amp; siblings out of debt then pay the folks mortgage and then buy beer
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-07 14:00:56	@CaseP Hmm don't know why you think I'd get hit for making that mistake under the premise of not knowing he was before your tweet ....
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-07 14:04:35	Working out at a religious community centre I really wish they had it posted online when the gym will be closed or shorter days
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-07 14:05:35	@JennAndTheCity I don't want to win the big money and not have epic booze to accommodate such a big victory 😉🍻👍
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-07 02:37:10	Just had a macaroon Passover style, I'm pretty sure it's more life changing than when I put pineapple on my pizza for the first time #Legend
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-07 02:49:47	@JennAndTheCity That was deep Miss Jenn Jenn, hope you're okay! *Hugs*
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 13:32:52	Waking up and seeing a spider on my floor got me the heck out of bed way quicker than I anticipated #HulkTornado
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-07 04:17:02	@JennAndTheCity Totally, I was tearing up when I watched. Next video on wings and sparkles?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 01:45:27	Bring back Castro!! #Jays
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 01:49:22	I know it's game 2 of the season, but what the Jays are telling us is sans Castro the rest of the bullpen is a work in progress eh? #Jays
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 01:50:47	Eh Leafs I know there's like one game left in the season, but would a scrap or two be so bad? Down 5-0 just brutal. #BitterE
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 01:58:10	@AndrewStoeten They need epic beards like you and Drew's #JobaChamberlain
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 01:58:33	@OkBlueJayscom Still the 8th inning no?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 02:00:25	@OkBlueJayscom Ah fair enough. Also I know it's game 2 of a long season but Cecil as closer I don't think could last could it?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 02:02:40	@OkBlueJayscom That's a fair point. Hopefully the offence picks him up here. I've thought they were the better team throughout the game
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 02:03:31	Why pinch for Smoak? He was having a solid game.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 02:05:03	@TheRealJeffS @OkBlueJayscom I can't swing a golf club in general, but I get your argument.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 02:06:54	@AndreaCam31 Ever tried the pay sites?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 02:08:20	@Sid_Seixeiro Kimbrel would have been nice eh?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-07 16:56:47	@CaseP But you're just a hitter as is so how would it be different this time? #heeltweet
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-08 13:54:40	@JennAndTheCity Haha yeah wasn't wearing my glasses at first but when I realized what it was/ put glasses on i sprung into action! #Bronson
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-07 18:02:27	Do what's fun if you're saying to yourself you don't find anything fun you need to go out &amp; find it unless it's murder then play video games
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 02:11:42	@AndreaCam31 Ah lame, a couple friends found success as in current spouses from the paid ones. I'm on the job search otherwise I'd try it!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 02:15:07	@AndreaCam31 Nah I got the faith you'll find someone, you're too glorious not too. Habs v Leafs Saturday, expecting the Old Yeller treatment
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 02:16:02	@AndreaCam31 Is it bad I'm not expecting Leafs to score again this year? FML
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-07 18:40:37	@hairtornado Oh haha that was a line I was quoting from a comedy video I saw.  Good point as well, I'm between jobs so finding fun is tough

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-07 21:23:22	@mvp1331 What about before dinner crunches while drinking beer between sets? #getfitordrink
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-07 21:26:37	@mvp1331 Its how I justify my beer drinking 3-4 times at the gym and odd crunches here and there #thedream

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-10 19:20:19	When people chirp my teams but say they read Three Cheers I always wonder if they ACTUALLY read Three Cheers since I'm a fan of bad teams
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-10 19:24:26	@JennAndTheCity Yep, the little "read" tag at the bottom of messages is burning those people LOL.

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 17:10:57	@mvp1331 then after you blend add 9 ice cubes then blend again then serve, it's good for 2 -3 servings. Or one big glass
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 17:11:33	@JennAndTheCity lobster gnocchi, keep it PG 13 that sounds diirtyy delicious :P
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 17:14:45	@mvp1331 The protein's from the peanut butter and the cocoa 7.4 grams of protein for 1 cup. But good nutrients in general, try it LMK

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 17:55:47	@NBomb If the taste is always delicious I agree. But there's different flavours depending on who makes them...perhaps all yours are bland?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 18:01:29	@NBomb I've used coconut milk this past week and it's been a game changer.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 18:01:45	@JennAndTheCity Oh yeah, white, I like the sweetness
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-09 18:15:56	@NBomb I was using water for the past year year and a half and it was getting bland just putting in fruit with water

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 01:44:01	@JennAndTheCity You need one of those nose band things they have in the human snoring commercials also sheep counting i find helps!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 01:44:36	@sledskillz Oh shit, I said tonight, I didn't say series. Who do you have Wild facing in the Cup final?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 01:47:44	@sledskillz Yeah i've got Isles v Jets with Jets facing Wild in the West finals.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 01:48:36	@JennAndTheCity LOL, do you have a cat too or just the dog?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 01:49:45	@BeerGirlCA @Redhook_Brewery Stress? Yoga? Also that beer looks delicious, are you still at Central? I want to stop by next week. #Beerbuds
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 01:50:21	@412TJ If you guys trade Crosby like you suggested last week, will you take Kessel and Dion off our hands?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 01:50:52	@JennAndTheCity Haha tough life! I was going to suggest the cat would swat the dog but i suppose not.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 01:51:06	@JennAndTheCity Also re counting sheep, I of course meant counting wings
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 02:00:07	@412TJ 9.5% at #1 45.5% at #4 45.7% at #5 knowing Leafs it'll be number 5
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 02:01:01	My pal @jet79 is the man, just became a dad, and still drinks better beer than me #inspirational
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 02:03:06	@412TJ Yeah Shero really wrecked you guys in the event the next GM wanted to rebuild.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 02:04:53	@BangBangLampley They set up a bunch of cushy stipulations so the beneficiaries of the current system can still make the most money
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 02:05:30	@BangBangLampley Like they're actually instituting a rule that beer cant be sold in grocery stores when Beer store or LCBO close (1/2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 02:06:14	@BangBangLampley So 24 hour grocery stores have to limit what they can sell it's archaeic still, more like 18th century not 20th (2/2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 02:06:54	@412TJ That's our plan apparently, fired everyone expecting him to come to TO...but I reckon he'd go to Pitt well before Toronto
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 02:08:11	@mirtle You figure TSN would have got it if Rogers didn't get all the NHL rights
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 02:12:44	@saints_gambit @GreatLakesBeer the best?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 02:26:34	@saints_gambit @GreatLakesBeer Is it at LCBO or did you hit the brewery? That's epic praise, you're on the payroll or just that glorious?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 02:36:51	@saints_gambit I've actually never tried that style of IPA, but you make it sound amazing. While I have you, had the Tempest Imperial Stout?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 02:39:25	@saints_gambit Had the single Imperial tonight, quite exceptional I agree. I'm trying to find the words to depict it on my beer blog haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 03:19:32	@SoundOfSexton @TorontoStar Solid video, I wish they spoke to more people in the younger demographics, 19 - 34, new perspective.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 03:53:31	Really hoping who ever wins this Ducks v Jets series makes it at least to the Western Finals instead of getting swept in round 2 #Playoffs
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 03:47:03	@AndreaCam31 You're talking the Sharp goal right? Also I don't think Crosby's the best anymore, what about you?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 03:48:41	@gurrback Not a Raps fan?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 03:50:46	@gurrback Oh man jealous, hope it's been a blast! I'll RT your tweet, I'm a Clippers fan so wouldn't grab those tickets unless in finals lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 03:51:47	@AndreaCam31 Where do you have Ovechkin ranked? I'd say top 3 but like his stats are like 53 goals 5 assists or something lol. Yeah Kane G
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 03:52:18	@AndreaCam31 Who do you have coming out of the West for Cup?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 03:54:24	@AndreaCam31 LOL. I'm still pulling for the Isles I want to see Isles v Jets but I don't know might be too ambitious
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 03:54:58	@AndreaCam31 Side note with how big on sports you are, how come you're not in the media? You'd be a great sportscaster!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 03:56:20	@AndreaCam31 That would be glorious. Heck just having a Canadian team get to the dance would be awesome. All canadian would be cool
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 03:57:06	@AndreaCam31 Yeah, I'd never heard of that broadcaster before she blew up the Internet. The web's ruined everything for ppl being dumb
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 04:00:58	@AndreaCam31 Think so re Winnipeg? Game 1 was wicked last night, I thought they were very much in it.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 04:02:09	My cable just went out, does this mean Leafs get McDavid the Clippers will face the Raptors in NBA finals &amp; West Ham will beat Man City?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 04:03:01	@AndreaCam31 Yeah between you and me I thought they'd hang on when they went up 2-1 after 2 but Perry came alive. Great series
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 04:06:35	@AndreaCam31 Pavlec's really bounced back after a few crappy years eh, i thought the Hutchison kid would start playoffs but Pavlec is
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 04:13:45	@AndreaCam31 Yeah I just think if Jets play like they did for most of yesterday that series will go 7 for sure!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 04:27:36	@AndreaCam31 Yeah absolutely. I know it's a game in but any series you could care less about? Like I don't care re Pitt v Rags or Wild Blues
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-18 04:38:45	@AndreaCam31 Yeah, agreed...anyways have a good night!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 13:55:07	@BangBangLampley County League lessons?

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 13:59:36	@BangBangLampley Smalls was the best
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 14:01:53	How many people became Dodgers fans after watching the Sandlot? Also it's been 25 years if you havent seen Sandlot that's on you #dudelesson

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-19 00:17:49	@Joe_17 Ha so lame...wonder who Leafs will take at 4
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-19 00:20:28	@Joe_17 Hanafin or Eichel for Leafs? What do you see happening? McDavid EDM, Eichel Buffalo, Hanafin Yotes?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-19 00:23:36	@Joe_17 I don't know who the Leafs have currently that would be worth Connor McDavid.

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-19 00:43:38	@The_Jmoney Re tweet earlier, I was trying to say when I grow up I want to be you for the food photo epicness

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 16:37:46	@1goatroti Yeah I feel the same, I always ponder contacting the restaurants to offer to run their social media in trade for beer or food
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 16:38:46	@comedybar Hey just curious is the open mic on tuesdays open to anyone to try their hand at comedy? / 5 minute sets?

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 21:22:41	@BangBangLampley Apparently the Sandlot actually came out in 93 22 years ago not 25 ...still young?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 21:23:01	@beermostly @amsterdambeer Solid beer, have you had Fracture yet?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 21:32:11	@beermostly Completely unrelated see in your profile it says Cicerone Certified Beer Server is that program solid?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 21:34:07	@beermostly How'd you decide between that and Pru D'homme? As a beer nerdist too I feel like it's my duty to take one of those programs haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 21:35:38	@beermostly Yep of course. Do you feel it helps you sound more fancy when writing posts at @bottomless_pint ?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 21:40:06	@beermostly @bottomless_pint Haha "I'm not a hipster I've got a degree in this" sorry making a joke, not meant to offend either of you.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 21:40:31	@beermostly @bottomless_pint Yeah I feel like I should take one of the courses to provide more credibility to @DoodleBrews24
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 21:44:08	@beermostly @bottomless_pint @DoodleBrews24 And write often I suppose would be the third thing. Thanks for the tips amigo.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 21:45:01	@beermostly @bottomless_pint BTW do you ever volunteer at beer festivals? Hear that's a good way to get more into craft beer.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 21:50:15	@beermostly On the @soundslikebeer podcast, they said "if you want to get more into craft beer/ work in craft beer volunteer" thoughts?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 21:53:59	@beermostly Yeah feel that way too, like i love beer, but not enough to work events for free, plus i'm on the job hunt so not doing free wrk
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 21:58:59	@Hopgobblin @beermostly Ah yeah I see what you're saying Mick, I guess I'm just hoping for $$ one of these days.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 22:03:55	@beermostly @Hopgobblin Yeah that's my thing too I don't have the i guess 'cushion' I'd want if i was going to work for free to start.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 22:04:10	@beermostly @Hopgobblin Also that's great Mick! Good luck!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 22:07:51	@Hopgobblin @beermostly @soundslikebeer Thanks for all the insight guys appreciate the feedback.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 22:10:30	My biggest question with the news that beer can now be sold in Grocery stores is how much craft beer will be on their shelves v Macros?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-17 22:23:40	@Hopgobblin @beermostly @soundslikebeer Thanks appreciate it. Good luck in your career change dude

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-21 14:14:47	Listening to Toronto sports radio first thing in the morning over epic tunes is a bad call...can't they sing their criticisms of the teams?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-21 14:17:26	My twitter's blown up with Toronto being the second most miserable city to live in...even in misery we finish 2nd!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-21 14:21:01	@linusesq Haha yeah, sports wise we some how finished 2nd to Cleveland, even though return of LeBron should have booted them from the convo
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-21 14:22:12	@BangBangLampley Actually it somehow went for sports Cleveland Toronto NYC and Detroit was 7. But LeBron in Cleveland should throw them out
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-21 14:24:09	New show #thewalkinggoetz ? *leaves room* https://t.co/bOGUKjegCE
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-21 14:25:25	@BangBangLampley Right? I thought that for NYC too...I think it's based on championship starved cities
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-20 13:08:03	Salted Caramel Brownie Brown Beer 6.3%ABV due out in September by Ben &amp; Jerry Ice cream &amp; New Belgium brewery #beer https://t.co/w4eGLeCnqQ

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-21 02:54:36	@AndreaCam31 @NHLJets Such a fun series...Little is a boss.

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-21 03:01:46	@AndreaCam31 If any of the sports in Pan Am has playoffs, since you said you're not down here until the summer (2/2)

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 19:29:22	@VintageLeaf Yeah I think today was a huge move in the (finally) right direction for Edmonton. Who do you think comes to Toronto?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 19:30:02	@whatthedamn @ChippysToronto @JennAndTheCity Totally, this weather in bananas lol. Enjoy the fish n chips!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 19:36:51	@VintageLeaf Maybe, I kind of want to see Eakins back here and have Dineen and King his former Marlies assistants as his NHL ones
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 19:59:30	Some guy at the gym today was practicing round house kicks and had an okay beard...wasn't #ChuckNorris
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 20:00:46	@Anita_Chauhan I read once the word "aw" means to show fake gratitude...don't know if that's accurate though haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 20:02:13	@RahRahRaina @Indie88Toronto Do you like beer is the real question! 🍻?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 20:23:41	@imogenjmb Any chance this will be your song next time you're in a karaoke bar? #NowPlaying
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 21:01:20	@Anita_Chauhan Yeah certainly, I'm all confused now though when I say something sweet, is it really sweet if the person says "aw" haha.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 21:03:07	Friends,I'm doing some work with the great radio show @InTheZoneCHRY could you like our facebook page https://t.co/nTSuNJkzeS it'd be great!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 23:23:18	Eating like a 12 year old at a candy store when you're 26 not as good as advertised #sweettarts #mountaindew #naucious
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 23:25:22	@NBomb Is Daredevil worth a watch like should I catch up or give it a pass?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 23:27:02	@NBomb As good as Arrow and Flash?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 23:28:34	@NBomb High praise, I don't have Netflix but I'll track it down somehow
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 01:03:06	Cleaning up after folks party, expanding my palate with some wine from J.Lohr and listening to Local… https://t.co/zPJRoc2N30
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 21:12:48	@thebigpeezy How do you get my tweets if we aren't following each other? Not that I mind haha.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 21:13:29	@spentradio @BNosanchuk You guys still making epic radio jams these days?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 21:14:33	@thebigpeezy Oh I get you. Well for the record I'm all for good banter with you, like I'm not intending to offend you with said tweets.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 21:15:43	@thebigpeezy Also my argument in my original tweet was to suggest more market options will lead to better prices at some places over others
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 21:23:41	@thebigpeezy I see what you're saying, unrelated you work for TBS or just simply pro current system?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 21:25:17	@thebigpeezy Nah, I thought that other guy who would hop on our other conversations was the TBS guy and you were an interested party, sorry
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 21:28:43	@thebigpeezy What do you think of this whole 20% of Beer Store has to be craft beer markup the government released yesterday in budgets?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 21:41:25	@thebigpeezy Fair enough. Honestly if it opens up more jobs I think it's a good thing to change the system. Thanks for the insight though.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 21:50:20	@thebigpeezy Yeah fair. Also feel free to follow me on here in case you want to discuss more.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 21:51:13	@The_Jmoney Giving up driving really? I guess I'll do the driving if the Bengals face Pitt in the AFC title game then eh? #Roadtrip
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 21:53:53	@The_Jmoney Ah that's fair. Also we still need to meet for beers since our teams tied last year for finishes.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 03:02:38	Anyone I know listen to Ride? https://t.co/Wx2S0BUd42 quite possibly the best band ever #Ride
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 03:18:49	@linusesq Epic #Heeltweet
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 03:19:22	@412TJ You think Edmonton would trade you back your 1st rounder for Fleury?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 03:27:54	@412TJ Yeah they need a goalie, I kind of think they'll grab Pavlec from the Jets.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 03:32:35	@412TJ Ship them to Edmonton for the 1st rounder and Jordan Eberle haha.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 03:34:22	@412TJ Take Phaneuf off our hands k thanks
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 03:38:42	LOL it would be Stajan another guy the Leafs gave up on too early #Flames #NHL
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 03:44:19	Calgary too good!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 23:37:36	@thebigpeezy Hey man I'm always open to new ideas, maybe one day we can collaborate on something.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 23:41:08	@thebigpeezy Not yet. In the works, but that's more designed to promotion of craft breweries less political.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 01:22:24	@thebigpeezy Ive been thinking for a while of writing up a post just about how to pick up the different flavours, mouth feel etc for new ppl
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 01:32:18	@NBomb #Marshmallowschat also what channel? Food network?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 01:33:55	@NBomb Ah nice, oh also was talking to Casey, aiming for May at some point to grab drinks/ food you free?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 01:44:44	@NBomb Alright
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 02:00:22	@NBomb @CaseP @CPantazis @JennAndTheCity I just need 20 minutes notice day of and whatever day gets planned and I'll be there! #blogger
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 02:05:17	@412TJ It's over? The party in Pitt is done?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 02:07:43	@CPantazis @CaseP @NBomb @JennAndTheCity Yeah good on everyone, *Finds something interesting to do* LOL
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 02:09:13	@CPantazis @CaseP @NBomb @JennAndTheCity No brewing just yet, but working on a few pieces on @DoodleBrews24 to promote breweries &amp; podcasts
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 02:10:06	LOL @CPantazis this just came up on my feed after your tweet asking about me brewing beer. https://t.co/7UaIcCDtFJ
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 02:13:37	Somebody check on @412TJ Pitt just got bounced
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 02:14:06	@CaseP @CPantazis @NBomb @JennAndTheCity Hey why's that first book blank? #thingsnooneisthinking
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 03:23:53	@NBomb @CaseP @CPantazis @JennAndTheCity Homer drinking water? I leave you guys for an hour and come back to some whacky messages haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 13:21:37	Hey @mcauz56 with all the chirping you're getting for being skeptical on the Raps do you feel like you've been forced to turn heel?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 13:28:31	@Moketronics @Emi_the_Rose @TheDrunk_Kitten sans pants video games and drinking malt liquor needs to happen haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 13:30:18	@YashYanthi Between your beer tour and this wine tour, I'm hoping your kids are providing alcohol picks when they're 19 to all their pals
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 13:32:21	@Moketronics @Emi_the_Rose @TheDrunk_Kitten Nothing under 9% ABU right?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 13:36:50	@YashYanthi @visitportugal Haha here's hoping to that by the time they're 19 craft beer and wine will be sold everywhere
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 13:44:11	Beer tasting intern?  https://t.co/1K2RyW9T6R
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 17:24:42	@JennAndTheCity Makes you wonder what the fare hikes were for if you're getting the same delayed service as always #sigh
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 17:28:10	The Tampa Bay Rays are the Jays kryptonite, even if Jays became a contender they'd have a losing record v Rays #randombaseballthoughts
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 17:32:27	Asking me to use my blog for your own beer agenda is like asking me to share my food after I finished eating..completely illogical #beer
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 17:33:15	For that last tweet if you think it made no sense that's completely the point.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 17:34:29	Also if you want to rant about being pro monopoly and anti change why not start your own blog to write those views instead of asking me to?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 17:42:26	Just to add to rant, Im anti monopoly and unions, so writing pieces supporting either is a bit of a strange request from randoms on here
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 17:54:46	Hey @CaseP my jokes to you are unintentionally offending @kdblez I just want to apologize to you for not believing some stories sans pics
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-26 18:01:24	@kdblez @CaseP Ah well it sounded mad to me, but that might be because I'm mad about some other thing? Apologies anyways fellows
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 13:46:28	This whole idea of beer becoming more expensive if it's to be sold outside the LCBO and Beer Store is a joke. More options = better prices?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 13:49:32	@crystalluxmore @loopandrewind @snacktimusprime @beer_education that sounds awesome! Also what do you suggest for cider for someone new?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 13:52:17	@Moketronics @Emi_the_Rose @TheDrunk_Kitten The one in Leaside? Also how is Roman Candle? Haven't had @bellwoodsbeer in almost 2 years fml
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 13:54:55	@Moketronics  @TheDrunk_Kitten @bellwoodsbeer Yeah I blame living in the north end of the city for me not drinking more Bellwoods #Beer
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 13:56:06	@Moketronics unrelated are you at a point yet with beer where you've decided what your favourite one is? @Emi_the_Rose
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 13:59:05	@crystalluxmore Glorious yeah I'll check them, I'm trying to expand my palate past epic craft beer! Also big fan of your work!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 14:12:08	@Emi_the_Rose @Moketronics Yeah similar dilemma. I only know IPAs is my favourite style, but I can be swayed for "favourite beer"
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 14:19:23	@saints_gambit Winter coat Beer Festival?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 14:24:36	@saints_gambit Two pairs of stretchy pants and some mittens should do the trick no?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 14:26:06	@Moketronics @Emi_the_Rose @TinWhiskersBrew Nice! Yeah a beer roadie to find the "10 best tasting beers of all time" is still a dream for me
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 14:50:34	Hey @DevTO is Monday's talk free or $$?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 14:38:06	@fightingwords2 I've been following for the wrestling and Caps references
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 14:38:48	@TheBeerRunner Rocket shoes?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 15:35:12	@saints_gambit @AgainstGrainTO Good tap selection, now I'd rather join you there in the laughing instead of in the cold abyss drinking beers
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-24 15:50:21	Think it's funny in combat sports when the undefeated heavy favourite suggests the bum their fighting could potentially make it past 3rd rnd
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 16:51:10	@DevTO Oh sweet! I'm hoping to get to the one this coming Monday, it's at 6:30 right?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 18:22:57	@JennAndTheCity Yikes that's rough with the date. Was it Neopolitan ice cream? #Trifecta :)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 18:24:46	LOL well done  https://t.co/HkPXU8KF9C
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 18:27:53	@TorontoMarlies @scotiahockey If the Marlies are the lower seed how come they get home ice in game 1 over Grand Rapids?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 19:18:59	@JennAndTheCity Oh man that sounds heavenly Jenn
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-25 20:32:35	@DevTO Thanks guys!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-27 23:52:25	Great talk by @Moketronics on SEO back end for @DevTO #DevTO

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-28 14:43:39	What's an appropriate time to hit the LCBO to restock my beer fridge/ pick up for blog posts? 10:43 seems early #beersearch
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-28 14:44:32	Teach me how? https://t.co/pDCuEq938p
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-28 14:48:36	@BeerworkingTO funny I'm about to head to LCBO for some beer...coincidence? Also what are you digging these days? #suggestionwelcome
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-28 14:49:30	@BeerworkingTO Continued from my last tweet, is there another beer working event coming up?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-28 14:52:25	@mvp1331 Also beer wise have you picked up the Hounds Black IPA from Big Rig yet?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-28 14:56:23	@blandy12 Yeah that makes sense, I figure going at 9 when it opens might be room for concern haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-28 15:00:05	@BeerworkingTO picking up a "Release The Hounds" Black IPA by Big Rig, for review on @DoodleBrews24 , send you link when I'm done writing?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-28 15:37:36	@mvp1331 Listen to this https://t.co/0rURvnT3C8 #NewMusic

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-28 15:14:03	@JennAndTheCity @teesang Bah good joke me and @NBomb as the "AJJ fan club" didn't have Airmiles to visit you for West Coast wings LOL

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-29 01:22:54	@morelandj After they have bench clearing brawls with the entire NL East
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-29 01:31:22	@morelandj Yeah certainly. All kidding aside, doesn't look like KC's lost a beat without Shields or Billy Butler. Playoffs again you think?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-29 01:49:57	Can it suddenly be a rain storm at Fenway? Liam Hendriks coming on is a bad choice Gibbons!

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-01 01:54:53	@Ben_T_Johnson That's why you need 5 right? 🍻
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-01 02:30:03	@real_JJ Can Q Rich and Mobley come off the bench in the second half? #Clippers
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-01 03:04:30	@sledskillz They made the Blues look lame. With Hawks goaltending issues could get by them too.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-30 21:57:28	@beermostly Go to a real bar @DukesRefresher across the street from there!

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-04-30 03:17:43	@thebigpeezy No where here, I brought some back like 6 months ago from a trip
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-01 02:30:38	@foodNURD Injured near end of the year really hasn't been the same since
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-01 02:42:28	@foodNURD Yeah haha that's fair. I watched game 1 and now I'm watching but haven't done much playoff viewing to be honest. Complaining lots?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-01 02:52:37	@foodNURD true. Also finally re hitting a 3 ball I read on here Clippers were 1-20 in past three games!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-01 02:53:38	@therealFOL They play Alex Chilson yet? #Replacements
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-01 02:56:29	@BangBangLampley Had us all worried #bangbangchat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-01 03:00:32	@foodNURD Right? Also we really rely way too much on Paul. Like yes he's the best player, but need the depth to shine through in playoffs
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-01 03:02:09	@sledskillz You place a bet before playoffs started? Wild look like they could win the whole thing
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-01 14:13:51	@therealFOL Amazing band Eh what's your favourite track by them?

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-01 02:27:07	@foodNURD Yeah, I think you'll finish it only because our bench is hot trash. Wish it goes 7 though
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-02 13:55:57	@Freeroll4life No we need Rafa in at West Ham...this play 6 midfielders and no strikers approach is mind boggling

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 16:40:19	@CaseP @SchwinnCanada Was it an epic bike at 16?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 16:45:10	@CaseP the only way more go epic or go home is what I say
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 16:49:53	@clickflickca A3. Kentucky Derby horse racing is a blast, it might only be 2 minutes, but it's a lot of fun to watch #randomchat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 16:55:01	@CaseP LOL just got back from the gym
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 16:58:39	@TheThirstyWench Blue Moon not actually being a craft beer...or you talking canadian craft beer outrage? #beerchat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 17:02:03	@SchwinnCanada @CaseP Thanks for the follow Schwinn...I haven't ridden a bike since I was 13 but look forward to your tweets!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 17:02:55	@TheThirstyWench LOL same, I was being cheeky
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 17:11:49	@TheThirstyWench @mvp1331 But but how does this affect the voting process at the next CBAs?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 17:12:59	@clickflickca A9. Beer, fried chicken, video games #randomchat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 01:57:30	Wow Game of Thrones what an episode! Finally some serious action!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 01:57:54	@412TJ Yeah man, Danny's going to be pissed!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 01:59:01	@Freeroll4life I thought Greyworm was a boss for most of that, on his own.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 01:59:55	@412TJ I was begging for a rumble between Tommen's guards and those High Sparrow guys. Hoping that happens at some point.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 02:02:43	@412TJ The only thing I hate is that each episode ends by like 9:50 ET instead of going right to 10. Wish they added 10 more minutes haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 02:03:37	Watching Wild v Hawks, I hope I'm still alive when the Leafs can play at this sort of level consistently.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 02:10:29	@412TJ God, John Snow's will power is serious man...Also re previous tweet about Tommen's guys fighting Sparrows, worst storyline right now
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 02:13:09	What's the name of the song they just played in the Blackhawks game at 2:48 left in the 2nd? #NHLPlayoffs
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 02:18:57	@BangBangLampley Who plays Max? Is that Tom Hardy?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 03:30:07	@jordangeville Roenicke to the Jays? At some point all this pitching stuff has to lead to a manager or someone getting the axe doesn't it?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 03:33:05	@jordangeville I agree, but i just feel like at the very least they'll fire Pete Walker, his starters going an avg of 3.2IP is terrible
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 03:56:13	@nympsam My doc told me in a similar scenario if they don't get a hold of you, that's typically a good sign. Hope it all works out.

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 17:57:43	@saints_gambit Should we create a light lime Radler to compromise?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 18:00:24	@fightingwords2 GOT episode was fantastic, trouble is you talk any current shows on here and people throw the punches we wanted in May Pac
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 18:01:31	@JennAndTheCity *goes to new local chicken wing restaurant*
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 18:07:15	@saints_gambit We need to start a counter company with better alcohol Saints Freeds Brewing?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 18:08:46	@JennAndTheCity LOL the dream re wings! As a fellow wings enthusiast I'm envious

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-03 19:15:35	@OkBlueJayscom I think that's been the toughest part to watch this year, those two struggling. The kids I expected to struggle a bit
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-03 19:17:34	@mikelipsius But Shawn aren't the tag titles important enough? #martyjannetty
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-03 19:18:31	@OkBlueJayscom Yeah shame he had back trouble, would have been nice if he chose a Jays return as his final year before retiring
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 22:43:15	@AmandaBlake9 Hope you feel better! Puppy cuddles are the best! How old is BROOKLYN now?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-04 22:53:34	@AmandaBlake9 Nice! Yeah my dog Bailey turns 8 in a week...which is crazy too. Glad you're feeling better! Hope all is well otherwise!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 13:04:30	I might have the dumbest neighbours
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 13:09:29	Neighbours who call the parking authority on you because you parked beside their house when it's allowed by the city are the worst
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 13:11:23	Also same neighbours blowing up at you for moving your car on the driveway next to theirs when you're trying to turn around are dumb (2/3)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 13:12:38	But the worst is when you're backing up from said driveway while your blind spot is blocked by said neighbours &amp; you almost get hit by a car
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 13:13:56	@Moketronics That one was a few months ago, two of the four cars we have got tickets &amp; our next door neighbours (not ones who called) got to
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 13:14:59	@GosiaBourne The kicker is they're not even old people they're this young family like parents in 30s. But they think they own the street
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 13:16:57	And then that same neighbour who almost caused an accident yells at you and gives you a death stare...&amp; thus that's why I dislike most ppl
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 13:18:06	@GosiaBourne Yeah don't think so. To be honest, they just wanted the parking spots and were mad we all had them.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 13:19:03	@GosiaBourne my folks say got to respect your neighbours but that house and the neighbours beside them are actually nasty people.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 13:20:19	@NBomb Can't, they'd know it's me. I'm just aggravated because I couldn't tell them a piece of my mind in person
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 13:21:45	@GosiaBourne Ah it's once in a while, but I guess it angered me this morning because I had just woke up to move my car and the lady freaked
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 13:23:07	Anyways thanks for listening to my angry rant where the only mean thing I said was those neighbours are nasty. I stand by it bc it's true.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 13:26:50	What's a quick fix for stopping being angry? Too early for a pint
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 13:32:24	@PokerDave04 Not even being snarky, my dog is on a walk with my brother lol when she comes back I suppose
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 13:33:50	@kjrose Oh it's true. It just seems like those nasty neighbours intend to ruin people's days. But oh well. Thanks for the tweet dude

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 03:50:15	@NagataLockII I missed it and WWE hasn't uploaded it on YouTube yet. That's a fair comment, re matches. Also just me or has Reigns improved?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 03:52:33	@NagataLockII That early 2000s Undertaker fly out of the ring onto the Heels thing was my case for Reigns being better.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 03:55:59	@ShaneD75 you can if it's a hashtag...there's an option to mute hashtag's on tweetdeck

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 14:58:24	@CaseP Surprised you didn't hang up or was that in person?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 15:17:39	@CaseP Yeah, good thing you had a witty response instead of flipping on them ...haha.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 15:27:44	@CaseP Sounds like they were trolling, that's the only justification I can think of for such crazyness

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 21:36:54	Alright Twitter what should I have for dinner any delicious deals going on tonight in Toronto? #eatingwithE
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 21:40:09	If ice cream pancakes ever become a regular part of a restaurants menu just let the aliens take over...that's how they'll get us! #dinner
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 21:45:08	@JennAndTheCity Have 7 for me? 🍻
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 21:45:33	@ROKR_CHIK Going?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 21:46:35	@ROKR_CHIK Jealous! Mike Patton is awesome
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 21:46:53	@CPantazis Ice Cream and pancakes on the menu?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 21:47:56	@mvp1331 tacos was last week on a failed date...but a good suggestion. I want ice cream pancakes but maybe a 5 Guys burger will suffice
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 21:48:33	@CPantazis Can I come to your house? #eatingwithE
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 22:33:53	@mvp1331 Bought Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich and fries and fruitopia instead #eatingwithE
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 22:34:01	@NBomb Bought Wendy's
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 22:55:22	@mvp1331 yeah good way to end a rough day.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 23:03:01	@hairtornado 94 Eh that's great man. You got those people skills everyone talks about?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 23:03:54	What beer should I have for Cinco De Mayo...Chimay Grand Reserve or Chimay Blue?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-05 23:07:38	@hairtornado dang it I should be laughing at this but my day has been terrible so I'm still bitter...glad things are well on your end man

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 00:36:27	Also Wendy's for dinner was grand but that Little Cesar's pizza commercial in jays game made me hungry again #microlifeblogging

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 17:28:43	@TheThirstyWench Oh awesome! Yeah same depends on the week really haha. Are you still in Montreal?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 17:44:25	@JamieLeighTO Are you bringing a glove to the game? Jays may need you to pitch!

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 17:49:07	@BoxingHistory 20 rounds? Did they stop for lunch midway through? Also how long were rounds back then?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 17:51:20	@therealFOL Your Rockets going to bounce back against my Austin Rivers led Clippers tonight?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 16:33:48	@JennAndTheCity I'd hold the door open and pay on a date but I wouldnt duel @NBomb for presidency of the AJJ fan club if thats what you mean
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 16:34:07	@JennAndTheCity the pay on a date and hold door is for chivalry in general I mean haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 16:35:49	One month of using a FitBit I've determined I'm hitting my miles goal but not necessarily steps goal. 1000miles in 1 year or less is tough
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 16:42:45	@TheThirstyWench Yeah I started Feb 9 using a pedometer then it died, so family got me a FitBit. I'm hoping to be maybe 1500 by Feb 9 2016
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 18:36:57	@NBomb Don't you tweet for that reason anyways?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 17:55:25	@citrusblack Time for an epic beer? Hope your day gets better!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 17:56:49	@therealFOL I feel like it'll go 7. We're playing with house money with Paul injured, so it'll balance out it has to
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 17:57:36	@BoxingHistory Oh interesting! Do you have an archive of past tweets Beard? This is a fantastic account
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 17:58:09	@TheThirstyWench Oh sweet! Let me know when you're back in Toronto be nice to meet you
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 17:59:53	@BoxingHistory Does that make much of a difference?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 18:00:18	@citrusblack A pitcher a hug and fried chicken?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 18:06:59	@citrusblack You a Jays fan? Also do you think our Leafs will be good anytime soon?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 18:08:03	@therealFOL yeah our 3 point shooters are more like 1.5 pointers I think it'll come down to can Griffin carry the load against Harden Howard
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-06 18:08:56	@BoxingHistory Nothing specific, just curious to go back and learn more. I'm a fan of all the history of the sport.

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 03:25:49	@BangBangLampley Yeah thats my take too, I like just absolute wars nothing but bombs. Technical fights im okay w/ but love no defence fights
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-07 15:35:54	@NBomb Yeah shaved earlier this week. You'd be surprised how confrontational people get with me now that it's gone...insane

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-07 15:39:47	@NBomb Yeah I'm sure the people who've annoyed me this week would have done it beard or not so just one of those weeks!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-07 15:41:01	Gave up a mission to @BlockThree to volunteer at a radio station after said station changed formats...should have gone for the beer I think!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-07 19:50:53	@lifeofLo Hey are you still doing theatre performances?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-07 20:27:46	@TheThirstyWench How big was the guest? Bigger the guest bigger the setting for an #EpicBrew
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-07 20:29:54	@JennAndTheCity Who knows perhaps you'll come back with a husband?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 00:17:42	Finding out you have more gas in your car then you thought you did #winning

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 23:48:45	@YashYanthi @WellingtonBrew @DrinkIncEvents Gah looks so good
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 23:50:01	@Alleycat17 That Dunedin team from 2011 has a few dudes now Eh, Loup, Tepera, I wonder if Brad Glenn and John Talley will both come up next?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 21:02:16	Completed a 10.16KM walk gosh what a mission didn't realize it'd be 30 degrees out FML #hulktrain
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 01:41:11	@efronb Wasn't Kirkland Angulo one of the better fights of 2011? Is Kirkland still trained by the lady who looked like she could KO him?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 01:43:33	@efronb I've slacked off on my boxing watching past year or so, any fights you'd recommend? @BangBangLampley @JasonTO
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 01:45:56	@BangBangLampley only for Game of Thrones
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 01:46:21	@JasonTO @efronb @BangBangLampley 2012-present
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 01:47:53	@JasonTO Who were the dudes in the fight I think from 2007 where the one guys mouth guard came loose and his trainer told him to KO the guy?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 01:48:57	@Alleycat17 @DShulman_ESPN @PitchTalks @Jared_Macdonald Has anyone asked if they see Toronto supporting two baseball teams or Expo return?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 01:50:21	@JasonTO I'll look it up to confirm, but the trainer literally got up on ring and was like "you better Effin knock him out" then he did it
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 01:51:43	@Alleycat17 I know people keep talking about montreal, but I'm surprised Vancouver never gets brought up. But I guess bc Seattle
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 01:53:07	@JasonTO Cheers. Yeah, been slacking on fight viewing lately, need to pick a weight class and nerd out any suggestions?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 01:53:30	@BangBangLampley Does Chavez Jr still fight?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 22:16:44	Double Chocolate Chip Frappucino with whip cream...Starbucks you spoil me
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 02:09:54	@JasonTO I'll check it out. I used to be obsessed with fights at I want to say Welterweight (165 - 175) or is that Middleweight?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 02:17:37	@JasonTO Ah yeah I was way off, apologies. I'll check out the featherweights, sounds like a blast. Any fights I should start with?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 02:22:04	@JasonTO Yeah was about to watch Lomanchenko v Maxwell from WSB Season 3 apparently?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 23:33:44	Delicious - Drinking a Cruiser Pale Ale by @amsterdambeer - http://t.co/9ddxRHr01g

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 23:43:12	@gregorMLB Starting or relieving?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 23:45:56	@Alleycat17 Happy to see him have success! Thoughts on Tepera promotion?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-09 00:02:09	@YashYanthi ah rough! I forgot to get tickets to the event. But drinking a cruiser
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-09 00:03:15	@Alleycat17 Yeah, I recall. Talley and Van Kirk I think will come up if they ever expand rosters to 65 lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-09 01:19:07	Believe it or not I might be passing this up since I'm on dish duty #noneleftforE #dessert #Delicious… https://t.co/WdBbULgEz0
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 02:24:35	@JasonTO https://t.co/MlM7EdRKGK yeah before tonight me either, I literally punched in Loma v and that came up first
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 02:29:12	@BangBangLampley Welp that was devastating. I hate that stupid move Chavez does where he sticks his face out like the guy can't touch him
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 02:32:04	@JasonTO Man switched to Loma v Russell...Loma's a blast to watch.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 02:32:28	@BangBangLampley Who's your favourite fighter currently? Triple G?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 14:30:39	@AmandaBlake9 @thehipdotcom You too! I recalled you also liked them!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 14:48:40	@JennAndTheCity Mine is wings and chocolate #addicted
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 14:50:09	@CaseP @WordPress Does Cyber Duck work as such? When I did database work we used Cyber Duck to connect images and text to our SoMe
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 14:56:06	@LenaRadio Mortifying
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 14:59:04	@BangBangLampley BBL Law Practices we charge in Cider

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 15:00:19	@CaseP I was going to say Google it but I'm no hater!!!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 15:01:42	@mariuch25 I always knew you were a super hero  would vapour trail by Ride be your theme song?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 15:02:41	@BangBangLampley Only the best for BBL to consider your case
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 15:03:54	Watching @YouGottaEatHere featuring Lisa Marie, they just made a burger with pancakes as the bun...I need to head there one day!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 15:05:43	@mariuch25 Have you heard Time Machine? What a tremendous song
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 15:07:20	@JennAndTheCity You're a real person? Between wings and chocolate we're doppelgängers...love peanut butter chocolate M&amp;Ms.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 15:08:54	@CaseP Are we having a Twitter argument or? Also it's different this time because I offered a solution before suggesting Google #KThanks
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 15:11:34	@YouGottaEatHere @fidelgastros Certainly I'll tag you both in that future tweet
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 15:12:27	@mariuch25 It's off their second album from 92 Going Blank Again. That entire album is pretty darn great.

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-08 16:39:31	@linusesq I got the faith J, you won't have those issues! Also Flyers going to get Babcock now that he's free to talk to other teams?

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-10 04:29:42	Totally didn't realize Faith No More was in Toronto tonight...definitely in the top 10 best all time bands for me. #FNM
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 14:09:15	Me &amp; Siri have an odd friendship I ask it "Is humus and banana a healthy snack" it responds "I've found 10 McDonalds locations near you" FML
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 14:13:43	@Hungry_Haven I told it I don't feel well it responded "why is that my problem" LOL
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 14:20:42	#todaysdudelesson You know you need to change your eating habits when even your Siri doesn't believe you can eat healthy for day #challenge
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 14:25:25	@bangbanglampley Hurt feelings? http://t.co/rDNAyKmyJv
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 14:27:47	@jet79 I don't understand half those big words but you can read to me any day JT
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 14:29:06	@JennAndTheCity I got the jist, the high five you were tweeting to me was received 😬👏
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 14:33:00	@JennAndTheCity Is it free?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 14:33:32	@jet79 well played
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 16:58:11	@clickflickca A7. Attend a concert on my own, I've missed out on a bunch waiting to find people to go with #randomchat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 17:03:53	@teesang @clickflickca You're too risqué for this subject man!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 17:05:22	@clickflickca A8. No ice cream but I had a double chocolate chip frappe which was described as "fluffy ice cream" by Starbucks #randomchat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 17:24:10	@Diontourage Too delicious
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 17:25:11	Guys I keep making enough food for two people is cloning myself too much of an ego boost if I just need an eating colleague?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 17:43:01	@mirtle lack of parity in league?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 17:47:52	@by_simone Hmm tough question, sexy thing to break the ice or to lead to something?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 17:49:23	I like how Leafs TV shows the early part of this past season through the summer, you know when big line played like the big line? #Leafs
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 17:54:36	@nympsam @by_simone Did he get a second date?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 18:00:10	@by_simone oddly sexiest thing I've gotten on a date was when I told a girl she looked stunning and she grinned and was like "you are too"
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 18:01:22	@nympsam @by_simone I once got "you're way younger than I thought, so I'm not going to sleep with you" but the age difference was maybe 3yrs
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 18:09:24	@nympsam @by_simone what's wrong I don't think so much it's wrong as its like it comes off like the dude wasn't genuine about more than sex
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 18:16:46	@nympsam @by_simone I guess the other question is how important is seeing that person again after sleeping with them on the first date?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 18:25:49	@JennAndTheCity I feel like a few of these dudes deserved some pepper spray when you were parting ways not just a "never talk to me again"
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-10 03:26:51	Today was Day 90 of 1000 miles to freedom aka do 1000 miles of cardio in a year. So far through 90 days i've done 440.82 MILES #GetFit
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-10 03:27:43	@mikelipsius Take that back, being a Leafs fan is like drinking Labatt 50 the goodness the odd time makes you question your sanity mostly
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-10 03:39:48	@BangBangLampley So true, what a punch to end things, just tremendous
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 18:29:02	@nympsam @by_simone Right right I'd agree with that for sure! I guess I was trying to play devils advocate? Apologies on my end
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-10 14:44:28	@JasonTO Best concert ever?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-10 14:44:57	@JennAndTheCity Hahaha! This just made my day! You the best Jen!

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-10 04:17:24	When I grow up I want to be able to write as well as @jet79 and @VoiceOfBeard and @tqbr staff and @corey_erdman #BoxingScribes
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 19:39:25	@The_Jmoney @JennAndTheCity LOL fair, for some reason I thought this was the one with couple that wanted the three way. Sorry!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 19:40:27	@geriatrikz "I made my choice" *keeps walking*
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 19:46:20	@The_Jmoney Great video you have more patience than me I would have dropped a #ComeOnMan when waitress finally decided to take your order
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 19:48:20	@BlackOakBrewing 10 Bitter Years is the greatness I hope my future children if I have any can become a solid 5/5 never had Pale Ale though
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 21:35:47	@The_Jmoney Yeah I've never had the wait forever service but had the server is going to take out bad day on you service many a time haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 21:50:01	@PaulMSagan They should have made the Pats trade Brady to the Raiders #realpunishment
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 23:43:07	@GrantHeston Hey man did you stop doing workout news letters? I haven't received any since December 2014 &amp; I'm certain I didn't unsubscribe
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-10 17:31:56	@JasonTO was it the real thing?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 02:15:56	Alright people who watches Game of Thrones and just saw Episode 5? I need to tweet with you!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 02:18:24	@412TJ @JohnPaulFutbol When they teased Tyrion almost being killed off I thought I was having a heart attack...insane ending!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 02:21:18	@Freeroll4life @412TJ @JohnPaulFutbol Yeah, I was also really thinking that little kid would knock off John Snow which would have been BS
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 02:22:55	@412TJ @Freeroll4life @JohnPaulFutbol I'm still bitter that kid killed Ygritte like #ComeOnMan
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 02:29:55	I've never met @ejbrooks but I'm certain her tweets about Arrowroot cookies rekindled the addiction I've had b/c of them #gimmeallthecookies
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 02:30:17	I just ate 6 arrowroot cookies and i'm still hungry #microlifesnacking
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 02:31:01	@JohnPaulFutbol @Freeroll4life @412TJ What'd you guys think of the dragons eating that one dude? Also I think afro is a bad guy too
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 02:31:40	@BangBangLampley Spoon apparently comes to Toronto end of June, have you seen them live?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 02:33:01	@mariuch25 You think Jays can trade Dickey? He's so up and down (no pun intended) I ponder what his trade value is since he's 100.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 02:33:35	@Freeroll4life @JohnPaulFutbol @412TJ Yeah I'd have let them just go around the city eating everyone but eh Danny's got way more patience
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 02:35:31	@Freeroll4life @JohnPaulFutbol @412TJ Re drink wine, big Tyrion fan eh?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 02:22:02	@GrantHeston Good to hear you're still kicking on here!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 03:25:26	@JennAndTheCity So sorry about your friend sending you twitter hugs JJ!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 03:30:20	Incubus and Deftones are playing a show in Toronto this summer and apparently it's not 2006...may have to get some tickets who else is going
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-10 19:07:20	Radiohead Bodysnatchers because #EpicTunes https://t.co/pO41By1C1k #BasementTapes
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 02:48:17	@real_JJ I really questioned the bench in the 1st round, but is this the best Clippers team we've seen in the Paul/Blake era? #Clippers
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 03:52:38	@Toolzchick  I read this as a shwarma triangle...hungry!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 04:00:33	@JohnPaulFutbol When's Koufax pitching again?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 03:03:59	Someone buy @therealFOL some four loko I've been a Clippers diehard since I was 11 and I didn't expect this awesomeness yet @real_JJ #Legend
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 03:04:40	@BangBangLampley Yeah they're one of those bands that like I don't want to see on my own but may have too haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 03:06:03	@BangBangLampley My pals here and I differ on the epicness of bands
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 03:08:09	@BangBangLampley Ohh I see what you're saying, ah no reason I can't, I've never been to a show on my own before should though
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 03:17:21	The Rockets coach looks like he's ready for the offseason. Hopefully Clippers put it away next game!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 04:08:53	@412TJ @Freeroll4life @JohnPaulFutbol Yeah when each dragon was eating that dude I genuinely thought it was two people. So epic
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-11 04:10:57	@412TJ @Freeroll4life  Yeah the Sons of Harpy. Also at the end before the fight with the stone people was that the other dragon?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 14:57:02	@BangBangLampley You ask Ray about it yet?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 15:00:46	#todaysdudelesson When stuck in a rainpocalypse at a baseball diamond last night it's okay to sit in your car instead of grab the bases
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 15:02:41	Some days I miss @CaseP #manlessons so I could write #dudelesson counters but 2012 was 3 years ago time for new hobby #dudelesson
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 17:14:38	@1goatroti @AmandaBlake9 Oh yeah totally, like the guy's completely oblivious to why he's getting yelled at. Which is the bigger issue
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 19:22:56	@WhitneyMayes Lol that dude you went to the end with was way too confident, for some reason I thought it was a new episode &amp; you won again
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:03:39	@1goatroti Yeah they lost me originally after the first 3 episodes, but I read there was a reboot mid season 1. Is that true?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:18:02	Serious question if the Stanley Cup ends up Tampa v Anaheim will those ratings be good? #NHL
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:19:27	@The_Jmoney Yep certainly. Any plans to see Jurassic World?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:24:55	@The_Jmoney I really want to see Avengers Age of Ultron, but I can't decide if I should wait for it to come out on demand.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:26:40	@TheThirstyWench Really? I watched the first episode but it didn't hook me right away. Did it take you a couple episodes to get into?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:30:30	@The_Jmoney @Judskii @foodNURD @1goatroti @tatianamaslany I'll give both a go. Thanks everyone!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:31:44	@BangBangLampley That's probably accurate, I'm a Leafs fan, so none of this matters to me. Wings coaching coming to TO though #intrigue
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:35:25	@BangBangLampley Not yet, apparently the plan is to drag this out until end of May and then Babcock will give his decision.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:35:57	@BangBangLampley Leafs are a hot mess though, so I hope he goes somewhere else, coming here would ruin his career.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:37:35	@BangBangLampley To me why would he leave? He's never missed the playoffs, team drafts well, system slays, doesn't make sense to leave
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:43:10	@BangBangLampley Yeah Toronto's very much a Leafs city then everything else. Like I doubt a Jays playoff run would get popular than Leafs
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:45:39	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley I guess my skepticism is like current Jays v Leafs blinded popularity. (1/2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:46:18	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley Jason do you think if the Jays made it to the playoffs this year it'd be bigger than Leafs regular season? (2/2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:53:31	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley Dang it I want to be as optimistic. I just don't know, I was 4-5 the World Series years so losing is all i know
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 03:00:52	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley I'd argue though that's as much because they're the only ticket, like if Mon or Van had MLB too would Jays be big?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 03:04:36	@NBomb @The_Jmoney Yeah, I haven't hit the theatre that often the past few years, so i'm a bit skeptical I guess. But we'll see.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 03:05:06	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley All fair points. Good arguing JT
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 03:07:06	@JasonTO  Oh absolutely, I know from my own experience I watch way more jays than A's because Rogers has the veto on the whole market.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 03:08:26	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley  I feel though, if Rogers actually played every MLB game like they promised it'd be way different popularity wise.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 03:08:45	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley Apologies, I went JT as short for Jason TO #Muteself
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 03:11:06	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley Do you go to a lot of games at the Dome?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 03:13:42	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley Yeah that whole black jersey thing was right around the time I shifted over to Oakland in 2006 just awful jerseys
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 17:38:58	@JennAndTheCity Just checked out the Madison Holleran story, that's super sad, like the feeling overcame her &amp; she couldn't shake it.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 16:15:59	@BangBangLampley Never heard of it?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 16:17:55	@BangBangLampley Will do, just googled them. Also have you heard the new Alabama Shakes album?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 16:18:17	@CaseP I feel like I should delete twitter but I can't quit it
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 16:20:26	@WhitneyMayes Yo if you're not working now (12:20pm) turn on food network they got your episode on lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 16:21:12	@BangBangLampley Yeah I was thinking of writing a blog comparing and contrasting the two albums
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 16:22:30	Well this is awkward LOL https://t.co/u1abzZmjyl
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 16:23:53	@JennAndTheCity Link won't open on mobile for me, who's it about?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 16:24:33	@CaseP New blog post Eh?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 16:25:48	@CaseP Hey to be fair you'd still have way too much to write being a dad or not haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 16:26:19	@JennAndTheCity awe yeah that is heartbreaking, rough how much pressure people go through
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 16:27:03	Father CPalms? https://t.co/56wBbKMeNt
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 16:31:31	@JennAndTheCity Yeah absolutely...hope you're having a glorious day other wise!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 20:56:33	@clickflickca @brewersplateTO Tickets all sold out? Sounds amazing!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 16:51:39	@corey_erdman or D) someone rewatched Kirkland v Angulo and thought Canelo v Kirkland would be just as fun? ...I'll go mute myself now
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-12 16:53:59	@AmandaBlake9 The kicker is the second guy getting mad he's being cottoned because "people in Europe do it all the time" FHL
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 03:18:56	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley How do you like Donaldson compared to Lawrie? J and Cespedes BBL?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 03:21:46	@BangBangLampley That deal for Lester makes me bitter to no end, I just wonder if we could have got by KC to face you guys again w/him
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 03:25:13	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley Yeah, that pitching you gave up for Donaldson you could probably use now. Donaldson is my hero.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 14:14:13	@mariuch25 Rice never played a game again  for rest of the year, like they suspended him a 2nd time for same offence once Bal released him
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 14:16:28	@mariuch25 Also at this point the NFL will just make up rules out of the blue. They came up with rules for violence against women post Rice
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 14:18:10	@mariuch25 the point I was making was yes he technically only got 2 games but the NFL then suspended him indefinitely once Bal released him
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 14:18:52	@mariuch25 cont so even though it was 2 on paper Rice actually got the entire year. Plus I doubt he ever plays again
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 14:24:56	@mariuch25 Ohh I see what you're saying. Correct me if I'm wrong but you're saying Rice should have been given 4 or 5 games first ruling?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 14:26:17	@mariuch25 Also agree totally about 4 games for deflating footballs. I'm sure that in itself deflating footballs has gone on forever
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 14:27:21	@mariuch25 Re deflated footballs to me if you want to avoid an edge for one team you make both teams play with same footballs &amp; see who wins
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 23:38:43	Somebody tell me a story about their first beer they ever tried in 140 characters or less #beerstories
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 23:39:47	@JennAndTheCity Is the next photo just the bone after you finish this monster? #JJbossmode
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 23:41:37	@AmandaBlake9 @brewersplateTO @greenbeltca I wish I was at this have all the beers!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 23:42:25	@pamm02 Sounds delicious!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 23:46:42	@whatthedamn to quote your Twitter handle "what the damn??" I'll take 8!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 23:48:40	@JennAndTheCity Never too much, you my friend are a hero...that steak looked outstanding!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 00:11:31	@NBomb @jfmezei By death? I guess at your house is the safest place now with political correctness &amp; people's egos being thrashed for fun
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 00:13:03	@whatthedamn to quote fat bastard from Austin Powers "get in my belly!"
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 00:17:53	All I've learnt from social media is that NOBODY on my news feeds  actually cooks they just eat delicious food from restaurants #FeedE
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 00:23:29	@NBomb You working at In &amp; Out Burger and the movie theatres now?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 00:26:59	@NBomb I need to scroll through your photos past the epic food
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 00:27:50	@BrewScout The beer from the previous month should be the prizes when you do contests on your blog if you do contests on your blog
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 00:36:42	@NBomb if by home you mean Ontario the closest thing I could find to a "home prepared meal" was two Jr Chickens and a McDouble you had!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 00:37:39	@BrewScout Oh nice. All I was poorly implying is Im happy to restock my own beer fridge with the ones you want to clear out...#beerpals
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 01:02:36	@PaulMSagan Cook awesome music! Also Rangers going to do it tonight?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 00:15:47	@NBomb @CaseP We were discussing me writing a blog on my addiction to the screen time...ironically it would be posted on my SoMe for RTs
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 02:27:46	@linusesq You drank the @JohnPaulFutbol kool aid and bailed on your Phillies?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 02:34:14	@linusesq @JohnPaulFutbol How come a lot of people hate Papelbon? (actually asking)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 02:34:52	This is great everyone should watch this when it comes out! https://t.co/trFZ698zpV
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 02:39:34	@linusesq @JohnPaulFutbol Ah true. Crazy head cases with some of these guys. I read Jays want him but he's like no way.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 02:42:20	@BangBangLampley @sledskillz Either of you planning on seeing the new Star Wars? 6/6 is my rating before it even plays
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 02:46:09	@sledskillz @BangBangLampley Fair enough. Also I just watched the trailer for Ex Machina, I feel like I need to spend a day in the theatre
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 02:51:32	@BangBangLampley @sledskillz Was that Natalie Portman? W/out seeing it I'm with Sled, I can see it being slow moving, but I'll check it.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 02:54:29	@The_Jmoney Have you read this? I wonder who'd play Green Lantern http://t.co/KfgotjWop4 #Superheroshows
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 02:57:43	@lenestam Always
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:04:22	@NBomb wait so which guy in the picture/ video got fired sunglasses or the guy with the yellow jersey?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:06:18	@CaseP @NBomb I think I'd only full on leave if I ever land a full time job where I'm too busy to keep up the various SoMe profiles
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 03:08:17	@The_Jmoney Right! I could see them giving Eddie the Lantern ring just to stick it to Wells for saying Eddie would become nothing #Flash

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 02:08:43	@sledskillz Really? I thought it picked up the last two episodes (4 &amp; 5)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 02:29:13	@sledskillz Did your interest get sparked at all when it looked like the stone thing was going to kill the Tyrion?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:10:22	How come the Jays can't win 19 in a row? Like is the two game blah / loss really neccessary? I feel like they should be way better right?

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:26:21	@NBomb @CaseP Yeah, I get that. I like it for the conversation on both Twitter and Facebook &amp; pics on IG. I'm in it for the social aspect
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:26:54	@NBomb Yeah they just say "Guy in TFC gear" but both guys have TFC gear
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:31:45	@mvp1331 Yeah I've been writing @DoodleBrews24 for 3 years sans paying money for training. I'm no snob I just drink a lot LOL
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:32:58	@mvp1331 Oh man that's impressive. Good stuff.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:36:00	@mvp1331 I guess to rephrase I think I'd only ever get certified as a beer expert so I could use fancier words in blogs that I got from book
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:38:44	@CaseP @NBomb Wait so you're telling me to stay even if I ever become Casey level busy Casey?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:39:45	@mvp1331 To be honest I just want to be at a point where I'm not describing a beer as 'hoppy' but as some big word that my readers get
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:41:06	@The_Jmoney @CaseP @NBomb Casey and I are playing opposite roles online like Dan Akroyd and Eddie Murphy you guys just ruined it
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:41:52	@The_Jmoney @CaseP @NBomb Trading Places reference in my last tweet
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:48:52	@The_Jmoney @CaseP @NBomb I feel like I'd be played by Seth Rogen and Casey would be played by Kevin Hart in such a 2015 reboot
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:54:13	@NBomb @The_Jmoney @CaseP Can Cumberbatch even grow a beard?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:55:45	@The_Jmoney @CaseP @NBomb I don't think I'd see that movie BUT if me and Casey have a Trading Places remake based on our lives watch it!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:56:41	@mvp1331 Yeah that's fair. I can't help but want to be more consistent with my blog but I don't always want to write reviews so dilemma
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:57:21	Alright interwebs, should I start Orphan Black or should I give Agents of Shield another try?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 01:58:18	@mvp1331 @DoodleBrews24 Eh I guess, I mean I've only got about 34 posts I should write more but I don't want to bombard ppls SoMe feeds
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:01:21	@mvp1331 That's the issue right there, it gets too niche past that. You're either writing about beer politics or the history of beer
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:07:15	@foodNURD @1goatroti I'll give it a try! For the record though have either of you watched Orphan Black?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:15:29	LOL @The_Jmoney coincidentally after you sent me that Jem &amp; The Holograms trailer, my whole twitter feed filled with rage and anger over it
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:25:48	@Judskii @foodNURD @1goatroti Yeah I'll have to look into both, @The_Jmoney speaks highly of both. Apparently Orphan Black is filmed in TO!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:58:16	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley I watch both teams b/c most of my pals here in TO are Jays diehards.A's it's the same playoffs generate big crowds
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 02:59:13	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley To me the dream is seeing Jays v A's just because I follow both so closely. I just want some good times in TO
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 03:29:21	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley Graveman or Nolin I think would be better than Estrada in rotation, but who knows really.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 14:06:33	Happy 8th birthday to the CEO of #DoodleBrews24 Bailey Bones! It's hard to believe I used to be… https://t.co/7HrO2fgGhU
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 14:10:36	@1goatroti @AmandaBlake9 Yeah I agree with both of you, but to screw with the guys livelihood bc the reporter felt insulted is too far
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 14:49:43	@1goatroti @AmandaBlake9 Yep and social media. The Internet ruining lives.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 14:46:31	#todaysdudelesson If you can't get out of bed after your alarm has gone off 9 times you should probably get a siren to use as your alarm
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 14:50:41	Ever had a moment where you thought you missed something due to over sleeping but then realized you're right on time? #winning
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 14:52:05	@nympsam @playgroundconf They're awesome every year!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 14:56:51	@nympsam Yeah that's fair. Yeah the one time I went was interesting for sure definitely a worthwhile expand my horizons moment #neverforget
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 14:58:39	Is it just me or is there a National Day on Twitter for everything? Like when is National Chocolate Milk Day?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 19:25:55	Look Ma no hands! #HulkFit  https://t.co/ftzHjIGqin
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 19:35:52	@BangBangLampley I feel like the only way to clear that rule up is to make both teams play with the exact same footballs in games
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 19:40:07	@BangBangLampley Would the league still be this big of a cash cow if they played within the rules?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 19:41:30	I hate when you get a call from a random number thinking maybe it's a job and instead it's just a telemarketer #ComeOnMan
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-13 19:49:49	@Shes_So_Savvy Nice beer!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 15:00:31	@nympsam Potentially yeah, or we should hang again, I think that first time I went was only in person hangs which is lame to realize :(
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 15:01:09	@BangBangLampley I should try and run a chocolate milk chat, maybe it'll have more legs than #attentionchat ?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 15:07:34	Thinking of making another #attentionchat tonight at 9. If you're free follow the hashtag answer questions with hashtag and rt to your ppl
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 16:06:46	#TBT Circa 2012 when @Doodlebrews24 needed a logo! Pumped to show this to a graphic designer/ someone… https://t.co/mK7eWj0BQd
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 14:43:41	@FScottHolla Yeah the worst part was I think they got cocky about being up 19 and then just couldn't recover ...teams are cursed lol.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 17:57:57	Saw a dude at a bus stop drinking some hard liquor having a big argument with himself...only in Toronto #wasntme
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 17:58:48	@The_Jmoney @DCComics Too much epic TV how do they expect us to go to our jobs?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 14:44:17	@Toolzchick Hipster?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 14:58:54	So 1945? Wasn't James Dean a hipster?  https://t.co/zvHDaVLaPu
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 16:47:09	@FScottHolla That's the best half troll half sympathetic tweet I've ever received...you're all class Neil

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 16:48:39	@real_JJ Saw your tweet about why cheer for them Sunday...I need to believe last night was just a dream haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 17:06:01	Fruit &amp; veggie protein shake or chocolate milk and toast post workout meal?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 17:07:05	@real_JJ That's fair, it's sad we're at the point that Austin Rivers and Hedo need to come through since Reddick and Crawford have been bad
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 17:07:45	@NBomb Get a Facebook
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 17:08:52	@urNutritionista Haha alright for sure! Also re beer for nutrition trade I'm free next week any day but Monday. Let me know
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 17:09:40	@OrganicLife @urNutritionista As a Sugar addict I need to try some of these
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 17:10:11	@NBomb it's like a photo album but you can chat with people
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 17:12:11	@FScottHolla Also re next podcast let me know when's good, my buddy @sami_e88 wants to join us for like a round table.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 17:15:18	@NBomb more characters longer statuses and fewer hashtags it's basically #AttentionChat sans the hashtag
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 03:07:16	@BangBangLampley https://t.co/ZLd2yRZiB9 This looks dope
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 19:59:08	@The_Jmoney You watch CSI Cyber at all?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 03:47:34	@whatthedamn @StackSmmmoked Such a solid restaurant, have you done the Stack Challenge yet?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 03:53:33	@jordangeville When are they pulling you out of the crowd to pitch and hold a lead JD?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 20:45:34	@JennAndTheCity Whens the post up? Always dig your posts. What's your take on coffee for first date? Over played or?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-14 20:51:57	@JennAndTheCity Yeah that's true enough hahah. I don't drink coffee either but they got these frappucino things out that are pretty glorious
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 18:47:45	@JennAndTheCity @pamm02 @blogTO @the2scoops Nice yeah I saw the link and thought you and Pam would be good people to tag. Didn't know Jason
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 18:50:09	@JennAndTheCity @pamm02 @blogTO @the2scoops Poutine Waffle sounds interesting, like the photo would be neat to see
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 18:53:51	@pamm02 @Eataly @Zomato Sounds delicious! Also pleasure meeting you yesterday!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 18:55:40	@ArashMarkazi Was that Blake 360 layup the best basket you'd ever seen?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 18:56:55	@JennAndTheCity Haha yeah I meant that and epic wine of course! Also what's the best wine you've ever had?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 18:59:12	@therealFOL I know it's game 7 Sunday but do you start Harden despite Rockets come back last night with him glued to bench?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 19:02:00	@ccampb85 How important is getting Google Adwords for your blog?/ freelance opportunities?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 04:01:59	@whatthedamn @StackSmmmoked Nah not yet, trouble finding a witness and apparently I can't share with my dog because rules or something haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 04:02:37	@jordangeville They had Todd Redmond for part of the start of the year. But really, you think the pitching will balance itself out or?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 04:06:25	@jordangeville That's fair, I just hope pray plead that when the pitching recovers the Jays aren't like 16 games back of division &amp; WC races
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 04:14:49	@whatthedamn Haha sure thing! Be good to meet or in this case meat (see what i did there) Have you had their epic shakes?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 03:54:32	@amsterdambeer Thanks for the follow, huge fan of all of your beers. If I could swing it, I'd have your kegs control the taps in my house!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 03:56:20	Where was this in Houston #Clippers? Also just generally speaking, is this the best Blake Griffin's looked in the playoffs past 4 years?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 03:58:08	@therealFOL Besides Game 1 it seems like neither of these teams can win on the road what gives?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 19:42:32	@therealFOL My heads not in the game today I apologize
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 19:42:54	@ccampb85 Ah that's fair. Also hope you're well!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 19:43:52	@therealFOL Yeah I think I jinxed my Clippers last night when I tweeted you about the road teams not getting it done this series haha.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 19:44:39	@therealFOL Yeah as for Harden you have to believe he'll bounce back in Game 7. I'm expecting it to end like 94-90 tight defensive game
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 19:46:00	@therealFOL I'm not making any predictions. I just hope it's close. To be honest I think whoever wins gets killed by Golden State in WCF
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 05:04:45	@efronb But why?? They've never been this far and they got rid of the present day Palpatine #Clippers
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 05:07:02	Yikes things got super interesting come on Clippers do this for all the years 3 Cheers was 3 Cheers For The Loser #sportsblogging
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 05:07:31	@efronb We get the lame Raptors commercials up here :(
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 05:10:34	@efronb Speaking of Oakland based teams you think our A's will turn the ship around or are Melvin's days numbered?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 05:13:31	@efronb Yeah I'd agree with all of that. I'm still shocked the Astros are on top...also wtf Clippers ...the pain is real!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 05:13:57	Bring back the 3rd quarter Clippers!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 05:18:53	@real_JJ They need you to replace the JJ in the game...Reddick and Crawford can't hit anything unreal
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 05:21:18	I know there's one more game in this series but this Clippers collapse is as bad as Leafs game 7 loss in 2013! Why can't I have nice things?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 05:22:48	Missed there last 12 shots...how is that possible? Clippers killing me but good on Rockets to come back FML though
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 21:35:58	@TheThirstyWench How's Quebec?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 21:41:07	@TheThirstyWench oh haha! Speaking of NYC a buddy was telling me you can get a 6 pack of Mad Tom there for $9 instead of $13 here in TO #fml
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 21:42:52	@saints_gambit @TheThirstyWench Seems in general the price point down south is far more reasonable
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 21:46:02	@saints_gambit @TheThirstyWench Id like the water taps in my house to pour beer....
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 21:49:40	@saints_gambit @TheThirstyWench Fair to assume both of your beer fridges are legendary?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 21:51:34	Picked up a bottle of the Matilda by Goose Island anyone tried it? #beerchat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 21:54:18	@TomMcAuliffe Speaking of Super Heroes what'd you think Arrow finale? Also have you seen the trailer for Legends of Tomorrow?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 22:15:13	@mvp1331 did you refrigerate or cellar it? I picked up a bottle of the 2015 but a friend just told me apparently 2013 is still kicking @lcbo
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 22:27:20	@TomMcAuliffe Same! Glad you dug it! Flash has been top notch too. What do you think of Gotham? It lost me midway through episode 15
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 14:46:47	There needs to be a station on cable for West Ham here in Toronto, five stations for one network showing the same game is just unfair #TV
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 14:53:14	@NBomb You're on it now?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 14:56:42	@NBomb I guess it's a way to control how much those places are willing to give those people? Like they budgeted out
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 14:58:31	@NBomb But how do you determine how much money they should keep giving these people if not for a budget?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 14:59:46	@whatthedamn Ah rough, I thought a few months back I was lactose intolerant, but still not sure what's up
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 15:52:02	@JohnPaulFutbol heartbreak!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 16:05:37	@mikelipsius game is tomorrow
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 16:06:58	@JohnPaulFutbol LOL I just want one of my teams to win so bad...should I just become a Dodgers fan?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 16:09:46	@mikelipsius Game 6 will be wiped away from the history books if we win tomorrow!!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 12:57:24	Wishing the only other diehard Clippers fan I know @real_JJ a happy birthday! Hope it's an epic &amp; glorious day and they get the series win!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 13:01:03	@FScottHolla Man when them dragons ate the dude holy moly! Also what have you thought of the season overall half way in?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-15 13:18:57	@FScottHolla Yeah certainly feel that way too ratings wise. Unrelated you see my Clippers go Leafs collapse last night?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 16:15:48	@JohnPaulFutbol is Vincent Padilla still the ace there?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 16:26:21	@JohnPaulFutbol Haha Yep. Is Puig back from the hamstring injury yet?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 16:58:30	@mvp1331 Yeah even though they're run by a big label I still consider Goose Island craft beer. They're also sponsors for @soundopinions
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 18:19:51	@soundopinions @mvp1331 @GooseIsland I'm glad they sponsor your show, it's my favourite podcast.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 18:20:38	@SoundOfSexton Avenue road LCBO. I've actually never had Goose Island before, can't wait to give it a try/ review it for my blog.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 18:20:57	@SoundOfSexton Apparently the Sofie is also exceptional, if you like Belgian Ales I mean.

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 23:30:26	@jordangeville Id like an 8 run lead just to be safe
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 23:32:56	@TheBoxicologyst do you just leave the cart there?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 23:46:51	@Judskii @BellyMonsters Haha I live vicariously through the instagram accounts
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-16 23:47:29	@mvp1331 Yeah trying to get into wine too just to expand the palate lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 00:25:16	I can eat anymore chocolate
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 00:37:13	@whatthedamn will you split it with me if I win?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 00:45:02	@mikelipsius wasn't he a known steroid user?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 00:46:13	@sledskillz Have you tried Reese's Pieces in chocolate bar form or a georgia fudge blizzard from DQ??
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 00:47:31	@mikelipsius Got the wrong batch
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 01:30:12	@teesang You'd think they'd spend more money on the bullpen. They'll be good next year when Stroman's healthy I guess.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 01:36:34	@teesang I read somewhere Jays have the cheapest bullpen in baseball. You'd think with pitching being their kryptonite they'd spend to fix
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 01:37:13	@412TJ You caring now? Also you think Babcock will go to Leafs or stay in Detroit?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 01:39:02	@412TJ I feel like your current guy is the right guy for our sudden youth movement. But our team is run by some guy who's never run a team
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 01:40:07	@teesang Yeah only guys making money on pitching staff are Buerhle 19 Mil / year and Dickey 16 mil. Bring back Clemens and Hengten?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 01:42:26	@412TJ We'll trade you Kessel and Dion for Crosby.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 01:45:52	@412TJ I remember when Scuderi was a UFA and that's what Leafs needed to get better that kind of D but they went with Clarkson instead FML
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 01:47:45	@JennAndTheCity I'll sit with you but only if we can eat wings at that time too.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 01:48:40	@teesang Even that one year where we had Corey Thurman, Josh Towers and Gustavo Chacin in the rotation was better than this #TheHorror
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 01:49:16	@JennAndTheCity Speaking of wings have you had Duffs? Also your roof or mine?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 01:57:04	Just reading back on my tweets/ watching my videos/ looking at my Instagram photos,if I didn't know myself I'd be pals with myself #waitwhat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 01:57:57	@teesang Henke and Ward would be glorious for the bullpen. What about Billy Kotch and Cliff Politte?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 01:59:29	@mariuch25 Jumping to the Mets from the Jays?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 02:04:41	@Judskii Why ruin perfection right?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 02:07:58	@JasonTO Glad you kept it kosher
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 02:12:46	42-0 36 wins by KO last 8 wins by TKO is Chocolatito the best flyweight ever? #Boxing #Pugulism
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 02:13:45	@412TJ O/U longer than Canelo Kirkland?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 02:24:10	@412TJ Never watched Flyweights live, fun division eh? How big are these dues 120?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 02:24:45	@JennAndTheCity So good, medium heat is my go too...what's yours?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 02:40:40	@Judskii haha fair enough!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 02:40:59	@JennAndTheCity Now I want wings hahaha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 17:45:50	@UncredRewrite Does your van have cable? #TVSpoilers
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 17:47:27	@TheBarleyBabe @ChurchBrewWorks Is it in LCBO? #DrinkingWithE
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 14:40:40	@JennAndTheCity I want to say @FutureBistro I know sangria for sure not sure about brunch though. It's at Bloor and Brunswick
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 14:44:00	@JennAndTheCity glorious, way closer to you?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 14:45:41	Is it too early for chicken wings?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 14:46:26	@JennAndTheCity Oh sick! Forgot you moved, how's the new place so far? Mazel Tov
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 14:47:47	@H8ersH8en Beer &amp; wings for breakfast I feel like @sledskillz haha #legend
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 21:10:25	@mikelipsius no $$ for MLB TV but when I had it for two years I was in heaven
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 18:01:31	@UncredRewrite Haha nicely done...also who do you have today Clippers or Rockets?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 23:11:30	@real_JJ Perimeter shooting let them down. If Reddick went like 15 for 29 instead of 9 maybe it's a different outcome
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 02:00:00	Game Of Thrones started off strong ended gross I guess we can say that about most episodes with Ramsey?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 02:23:21	@VoiceOfBeard I liked that Munroe guy, completely out of his league with Triple G, but I feel like him v Kirkland might be fun to watch
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 02:24:20	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley Chocolatito v Lomanchenko can it happen? Would you watch it? #boxing
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 02:28:13	@VoiceOfBeard I mean to the casual fan (me) his style comes off as one extreme to the next. But agree don't know how much he's got left
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 02:32:23	@VoiceOfBeard Yeah certainly agree. I just wish the more skilled guys fought each other more often instead of Kirkland style fighters
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 20:57:37	I want to be as optimistic about anything as Mike Wilner is about bad Jays teams,you know they haven't made playoffs in 22 years right? #MLB
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 21:04:20	@mikelipsius Got stuck on the Jays Eh?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 21:05:03	@JohnPaulFutbol Can me and @BangBangLampley be on your Marlins coaching staff?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 21:05:37	Come on you Clipppperrrrssss
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 21:06:18	@littlerachelann You live up that way? I'm at bathurst and wilson #neighbourschat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 21:07:33	@mikelipsius I watch because they won't show Oakland games...I hate Wilner's optimism, you'd think Jays have won WS for 22 years
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 21:16:06	Some of these shots the Clippers are missing ie open threes the Rockets secondary make look so easy #sigh
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 21:18:52	Why do all my teams stink?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 22:20:21	Shout out to @real_JJ &amp; @therealFOL heck of a series, shame it's over #CLIPPERSvsROCKETS
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 22:20:54	@littlerachelann Nice! I hit the JCC by there all the time! Cool!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-17 22:29:32	I love the Clippers, Leafs, Bengals, West Ham and of course the Oakland As. Hoping one of these teams wins a title in my life time #3Cheers
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 16:39:23	Shoutout to everyone who went to @RunTOBeer run today heard something like 340 people attended! Good to see running &amp; beer can go together!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 16:40:36	Sadly missed @RunTOBeer run still building up but hoping to be runner 341 sometime this year #runbeerrun
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 17:02:34	@ArashMarkazi Fair points. Do you see them bringing Reddick and Barnes back? Those guys I thought had a bad series even up 3-1, thoughts?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 17:05:06	Alright Twitter what should I see first Avengers 2 or Mad Max Fury Road?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 17:18:25	@JohnPaulFutbol More kids on the way?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 17:40:57	@NBomb @BangBangLampley Should that be our next chat group? #confusingchat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 17:41:17	@JohnPaulFutbol You're a father to many Eh #legend
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 14:06:38	Turned down going out to Collingwood for the gym...I don't know who I am
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 18:37:02	@Judskii Fried Chicken and a greek salad?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 18:39:49	@foodNURD What type of beer? Corona?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 18:44:21	@NBomb I don't know, I think Ramsey needs to get killed after that episode, think Theon kills him?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 18:45:04	@mikelipsius They're the one group that makes other terror groups be like "those guys are psychos"
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 18:46:44	@foodNURD @GreatLakesBeer Great brewery!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 19:06:01	@Alleycat17 When do the nice things start happening for the Jays??
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 19:07:12	@mikelipsius Fire Gibbons and pray?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 19:49:04	@mikelipsius I wanted to see him get hit so they'd clear the benches...see a fight or two lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 16:42:17	@The_Jmoney Sounds like a stomach ache, but as a wise person once said "isn't life about deciding which stomach aches are worth it?"
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 16:45:31	@BangBangLampley Fast Food chain with Hooters style waitresses that let a biker gang war start in their restaurant in Waco yesterday
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 16:47:42	@ArashMarkazi Really you'd say it's number one? Top 5 for sure, but what about that 01-02 team with all that promise that never did anything
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 16:48:16	@FlyingDog Road trip to see you = fresh air outside?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 22:25:35	@mikelipsius I had the @GooseIsland Matilda this weekend have you tried it? It was exceptional
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 16:53:19	With #AttentionChat failing miserably at 9pm every 6 months I'm thinking 6pm every other week should help things #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 17:17:41	@JennAndTheCity You know if they win you have to go to every game here on out right? Also which beer from Goose Island is that? #beerme
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 17:40:29	@JennAndTheCity you my friend are a hero haha. Hoppy is good! Love IPAs! Tans are the best 😎😬👍
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 19:12:25	@NBomb Re Cersei to be honest I'm shocked she's lasted this long. Also I hope the Sparrows get dealt with soon.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 19:14:08	@mikelipsius It wasn't his fault the first time he got fired but he still got fired. In Toronto nobody is ever to blame it seems you know?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 19:15:54	@NBomb Yeah, I want Tommen to grow a pair and get his guards to deal with the Sparrows, he's too wimpy as King
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 23:32:49	@BangBangLampley You listen to Future Islands? What a band.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 23:33:45	@mikelipsius @GooseIsland Try the Matilda and Sophie both glorious though I need to try the Sophie, but BA says it's outstanding!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-18 21:03:01	@Forever_WestHam I kind of wonder how his season would have gone these past 3 months post Carroll injury Zarate better than Nene you think?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-19 02:17:04	All caught up on The Following, what a crazy show, hoping the 2 hour series finale lives up to the greatness!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-19 02:58:56	If this leads to a Kane v Seth Rollins main event at Elimination Chamber I'm finally done with wrestling #Wrastling
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-19 14:25:43	@NBomb The Millenium Falcon wasn't his ship!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-19 14:52:07	@JennAndTheCity You should ask your doctor to give that kid a sedative to keep them quiet. Also hope you feel better soon after
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-19 14:59:56	#todaysdudelesson When working from home or on the job hunt it's important to get out of bed before noon. Otherwise you'll be stuck all day

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 02:08:47	@BangBangLampley I think 5 questions spread out over 30 mins for #AttentionChat is the right way to do it from now on.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 02:10:36	@BangBangLampley Yeah and set topics like "Candy Bars" or Action Films is good too get more people. The more the merrier really.

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-19 18:27:42	@sincerelysab @foodieyu Is the $15 worth it for a burger too though?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 00:33:17	@JennAndTheCity Re @SmoqueNBones let me know if you're free to hit it one day, I feel like meeting up with Twitter pals is why I'd go lol

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 13:50:57	@CaseP Are you speaking in this? Also TV wise apparently Blacklist season 2 finale is bananas
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 13:57:46	@CaseP Thing is the season has been up and down but it picks up the final like 5 episodes
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 13:59:20	@CaseP I've never watched Sons :(
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 14:28:48	@CaseP @NBomb I meant free like you'll only bring 3 notepads to grab food instead of 75
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 14:35:25	For a guy that tweets about beer sports and 12 year old jokes, I sure do get lots of wine, bible thumper &amp; coding followers who don't say hi
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 15:47:02	@NBomb @CaseP To be fair you don't know what's going on in most conversations #JustSaying

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 15:02:13	Every time I want to ease up/ step away from social media platforms like Twitter Facebook or IG I get drawn back in. Need a SoMe AA though
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 17:20:29	@ChucksBurgerBar @sincerelysab @foodieyu Now I need to drive to Hamilton to get one of these FML

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 17:55:40	@mikelipsius You're only 30?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 16:22:59	@The_Jmoney Solo you can be less committed to others schedules! I went to Italy on my own at 16 had a blast.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 19:10:49	@BangBangLampley If you go pro in boxing you'll get a Title shot right away
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 20:16:00	@LorenMcGinnis What's that show called where they cure addictions? Intervention on A&amp;E?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 18:15:23	@Joe_17 That beard is legendary
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 18:17:31	@Joe_17 I hope with babcock people still realize he's got to rebuild the team. Feel like people will think it's Cup time next year.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 18:22:10	@Joe_17 I wonder though if the fan base will be as patient now that Babcock is the coach. I read Guy Boucher may come as an Assistant too.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 18:25:30	@Joe_17 We'll see what happens haha I follow too many Leafs critics so i'm skeptical too. Apologies.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 18:28:36	@Joe_17 Think they had too after that story last year about how Kessel was bigger than the coaches? Like think they had to give him big $$?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 18:58:37	@JennAndTheCity Really? What happened to asking for numbers do people use phones anymore besides for Tinder?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-20 19:05:26	Every time I think I'll quit the NHL / Leafs they draw me back in. Babcock could be the love child of Quinn and Burns = Super Leafs Coach?

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 16:05:26	@NBomb You take that back and learn how to grow beards
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 16:15:07	@NBomb Have you learnt how to grow a beard yet?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 19:25:40	@sincerelysab I only follow you for the funnies!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 19:30:46	@sincerelysab Anytime here to encourage!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 19:48:48	As a diehard sports fan how much of my cynicism can be blamed on the media covering my teams? Or should they be off the hook? #sportspollQs
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:00:44	@JennAndTheCity Strictly Internet? Any dating site to meet people. In person the gym but it's risky
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:02:32	@FitFannies Wait wouldn't having neither be a negative?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:06:15	@JennAndTheCity Oh I stand by the gym but also taking your dog for a walk helps. Although my dog uses me to pick up other dogs LOL
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:07:45	@clickflickca Nah, it'll take at least 5 of those 8 to build a team good enough to get to finals and then it's a crap shoot from there
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:09:02	@FitFannies Ah I understand...that's good you're happy! Still searching on my end but glad you've got things figured out!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:09:57	@clickflickca It's tough to be optimistic with them given how the past few seasons have gone, but agree maybe some luck
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:12:47	@clickflickca Yep for sure. Here's the real question who wins a Title first in next 8 years Leafs or Raptors or Jays?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:13:48	@NBomb Hey hey we support your bashing of big corporations but leave our beloved rotten hockey team &amp; new coach alone for at least 3 years!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:15:30	@JennAndTheCity Yeah, it's risky, I mean if I'm spotting a girl while she does bench presses that's one thing but flirting at gym is tough
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:16:38	@NBomb @JennAndTheCity Nick is taking notes haha.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:17:12	@JennAndTheCity @NBomb Isn't through friends tricky too (asking) in case it doesn't work out?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:17:45	@NBomb Why do you hate on the things I love? #AttentionChat #UltimateHeel
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:18:33	I'm sorry @BangBangLampley but @NBomb I think is the #UltimateHeeltweeter
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:19:40	@NBomb To be fair I love bad teams you just like to kick things when they're already down #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:20:15	@JennAndTheCity @NBomb This is true, you should write a dating blog JJ but like be paid for it
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:24:06	@NBomb But what did MLSE do to make themselves hated besides make hockey tickets unaffordable for a team nobody but me will watch for 3yrs?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:25:27	@NBomb @JennAndTheCity I have no ego, but I see your points haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:26:24	@NBomb The new Leafs coach says fear is just a momentary lapse before you take on a new challenge maybe it's a good thing? @JennAndTheCity
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 20:41:46	@JennAndTheCity @NBomb LOL *Drops mic* JJ #heelturn ? Yeah I'd agree with all of that.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-22 03:16:44	@Shakabrodie With Coco's neck giving him trouble again I'm expecting you to be a September call up, even August for the playoff push #OakAs
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-22 03:33:59	@Shakabrodie You'll take Brett Lawrie's position in the KC Games right?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-21 22:53:44	@JennAndTheCity @NBomb Super delayed but if there's a ton of ways to meet other single people how come it's a struggle for most ppl? Picky?

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-22 13:59:45	@JennAndTheCity Yeah to me $75 is too steep, I guess it catered to people not on budgets hahahaha. :)

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-22 13:55:54	@JennAndTheCity Haha possibly, I was more tweeting for conversation lol. But yeah worth looking into sure
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-22 13:57:36	@bruce_arthur Re point on Ducks players who still hate Babcock from Macko &amp; Cauz who's left from those teams? Beauchemin?

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-22 16:46:54	@CaseP I never used any of the tips, but I thought it was an interesting story. My point was a trolling ethics should carry some weight too
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-22 16:48:25	I read this over, isn't failing and having neither the same thing?  https://t.co/SAx3lbhYhI

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-22 15:05:25	@BangBangLampley I got up at 7 but went back to bed 5 minutes ago #chillChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-22 15:10:25	@CaseP There should be a troll code of ethics like The Game by Neil Strauss except for trolling appropriately
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-22 17:24:49	@CaseP lol on the subway that's a tremendous trolling move no? "Hey ladies this book is going to teach me how to talk to you" haha.

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-24 00:58:25	@JennAndTheCity What type of cocktail would you recommend? Is mudslide a cocktail? @NBomb
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-24 01:07:06	@YashYanthi I actually haven't been to Duffs in almost 7 years, but that's more because I can't coordinate cheat days with pals lol (1/2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-24 01:07:54	@YashYanthi St. Louis is awesome, I like the Hot Sweet Asian both because it's delicious and for the look on the servers face when I giggle

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-24 15:53:25	@ROKR_CHIK Do you just answer "He's good?"
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-24 15:55:16	Welp, 2-0 defeat West Ham played like the Leafs from XMas on wards, no wonder I root for both as they disappoint for another year #3Cheers
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-23 13:40:56	Anyone got the lineups for West Ham today and a stream? Don't get Sportsnet World for some reason #sigh
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-23 14:49:30	@CaseP @NBomb Music's the one thing I'm not stubborn/ set in my ways on. I try to poach music from people all the time to expand my horizons
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-23 14:49:54	@CaseP @NBomb What was the song you dug?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-23 14:51:45	@NBomb @CaseP You guys hit many concerts or too picky?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-23 14:53:40	@NBomb There's free music nights at the Horseshoe Tavern Mondays and Tuesdays...still out of your price range? #Heeltweet #Butnotreally

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-23 14:57:10	@CaseP @NBomb Check out Riva by Klingande it's awesome
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-23 14:59:11	@CaseP @NBomb Yeah I haven't been to a concert in a few years but that's more a not wanting to fly solo thing than not aligning with artist
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 03:12:35	@trisarahhops Epic band!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 03:13:53	@whatthedamn @REDSRestaurants @SCADDABUSH @DukesRefresher @blogTO Dukes is awesome! They used to make funnel cake which was deadly!

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 03:16:13	@whatthedamn I think I was the only one that ate them, also the craft beer selection @DukesRefresher is quite good if you're into local beer

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 03:22:36	@trisarahhops I know it needed to happen but I was pretty sure they'd go with an assumption on the audience part not show it lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 03:31:48	@whatthedamn @DukesRefresher Anytime, always happy to spread the word on good things to new epic pals!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 14:30:14	@clickflickca rebel ipa? Who brews it?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 14:33:36	@Joe_17 Now you know you're married when the wife makes you shave &amp; get a haircut #happywifehappylife
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 14:35:30	@DukesRefresher Yeah hard to believe haven't been back since August last year.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 14:41:14	This is from March 2014 when me &amp; @fitfannies had funnel cake @dukesrefresher I wish they still had… https://t.co/b8qu40Ja0U
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 14:43:45	@TomMcAuliffe I'll take all of them!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 14:46:06	@mikelipsius Sounds like a typical Monday in Toronto
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 03:38:16	Nothing more crushing than losing a years worth of podcasting work trying to make room on your computer and hitting the wrong button #bummed
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 03:40:40	@NBomb Those were the backups...I feel horrible. I know you hate my podcast, but I loved working on it more than anything I've ever done
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 03:48:19	@NBomb I'm in a mood, and I assumed at the time of said critique that you hated it. I'm crushed though, a years worth of work gone #sigh
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 03:55:29	@BangBangLampley First 4 episodes on Soundcloud, but the backups of those files and commercials I've put together / intro all got deleted.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 03:56:26	@NBomb Nah happened last night, I mean the one positive is the first 4 episodes are on Soundcloud but all the backups/side ideas are gone
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 03:57:09	@BangBangLampley I'll probably redo things but it's been my vice for a year so to have everything get deleted by accident is bumming me out
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 04:09:07	@NBomb You sound like @CaseP you're both probably right. I think it's the end of the radio dream, on to something else. Good talk NB
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 15:09:44	@DukesRefresher Needs to return!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 16:44:02	@Judskii Wouldn't your spare million go to epic food?

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 02:00:54	@Freeroll4life Good for Sam finally sealing the deal with Gilly. I didn't even realize Ghost was still with Jon
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 02:02:22	@Freeroll4life One of my buds was saying we don't know what these fanatics are about, that they could turn on Cersei too for all we know
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 02:03:53	@trisarahhops What type of dance? Two step? #dancingwithE
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 02:04:03	@foodNURD What an epic episode

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 02:07:54	@412TJ @Freeroll4life When he was like "I'll start a war if I have to" I was thinking after they took Cersei "Yep time for war"
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 02:08:35	@foodNURD I was happy for Sam lol. Epic twist with Cersei Eh?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 02:09:30	@Freeroll4life Yeah nobody is safe now.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 02:15:46	@foodNURD I really thought they'd kill her then and there, which would have been bananas. My brain may have exploded lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 02:17:56	Game of Thrones similar to my sports teams just when I think I'm done they pull me back in...great episode really 👍 it's about to pick up!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 02:18:59	Never been more excited to read a recap for GOT than this episode @FScottHolla #BoxRecaps
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 02:20:19	@GosiaBourne Omg right, when she chilled after asking about what'll happen with Margery I was like "this is strange"
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 02:21:49	@412TJ Yeah hard to believe we're already at 7. 9 is the big one for every season. Also they just played GOT theme on organ in TB V NYR game
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 02:23:02	@GosiaBourne Haha I actually tell everyone I know not to contact me for that hour just like "message me at 10 it's Thrones time" lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-25 02:40:57	Some of these shows both on cable and Netflix I've got no idea how they expect fans to go to work after having our minds blown! #EpicTV
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-26 04:27:04	@Joe_17 That's what she said?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-26 04:30:14	@Joe_17 I wonder what happens after in that scenario, it's like "Well, wanna go again?"  or is turning on sports centre okay to do? LOL

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 14:22:01	LCBOs with craft beer growler stations by August? Is this really 2015 or are we in 2025? #TOBeer
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 14:45:57	General question, is expecting clean draught lines being too snobby when ordering a beer or something anyone no matter the beer should want?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 14:46:37	LOL @JennAndTheCity weren't we tweet discussing this a couple days back?  https://t.co/KSXrbjYUNL
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 14:47:24	@UncredRewrite When you ask students what comes after a sentence do they say 'you get an appeal' every time? #PrisonTerms
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 14:54:11	@NBomb re clean draught line not having a 12 foot tape worm end up in your beer OR if your beer is flat it's dirty  https://t.co/N60QrEMDEc
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 14:54:56	@BangBangLampley You're like the oracle from Matrix #Wisdomheadz
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 14:55:58	@NBomb Read this http://t.co/fdN4iPimuf #DraughtLines
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 14:57:07	@trisarahhops Yeah, was it a Macro Beer? I hear that's a criticism for Macro beers, commonly bad because of dirty draught lines at bars.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 14:58:08	@JennAndTheCity @MensHealthMag Interesting article but I can see it being kind of offensive too. It's written to make guys seem dumb.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 14:59:00	@mvp1331 Question, when you heated the cheeseburgers did you eat them right away or wait until you got to work?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 15:00:25	@NBomb Well, if it's not cleaned it can lead to a calcium build up in the beer which then makes the beer undrinkable.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 15:01:46	@mvp1331 In radio school we heated up a couple cheese burgers for a project then ate them an hour later instead of right away,worst decision
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 15:02:51	@NBomb I think it comes off snobbish b/c most people complaining about draught lines drink craft beer so it's conveyed wrong you know?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 15:03:57	@NBomb There's this negative perception with craft beer, that if you don't drink big label beer you're a snob, not going off what you enjoy
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 15:05:14	@NBomb It's a dumb argument but re dirty draught lines Ive heard b/c most Macros are lagers,it's just assumed the beer should taste that way
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 15:06:27	@NBomb I don't know maybe. Personally I drink craft beer because of the hops / flavour notes since i'm obsessed with taste. (1/2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 15:07:31	@NBomb To me I don't 'taste' anything unique in a Labatt or Coors so that's why I go with craft beer more frequently, but I love 50 to (1/2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 15:08:36	@trisarahhops Hmm, was it definitely the draught lines though? Like had you had the beers you ordered before and they tasted better?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 15:11:17	@mvp1331 It smelt pretty terrible an hour later, tasted like puddy. One was from 5 Guys the other from Burgers Priest. Should have gone 1st
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 15:13:55	@mvp1331 The project was to be foodie experts on a TV Show so we were comparing two different burger chains. We were going to go first but
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 15:14:29	@mvp1331 But one of the guys in our group wanted to go over the script which was literally "This is the food expert" so we went last instead
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 15:15:18	@mvp1331 I'm sure though if we'd gone first the burgers would have been fine/ not stunk haha. Ah radio school good times.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 15:25:35	@NBomb Yep certainly.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 15:25:51	@trisarahhops Absolutely, that's a big indicator
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-27 15:27:47	Lost a few followers with 'hot draught lines talk' thanks for sticking it out as long as you did though!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:24:48	@JennAndTheCity Yeah been there before! But I mean we've all had bad dates right? Nothing lamer than being taken advantage of
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:26:23	@JennAndTheCity bah I have questions I can't word in 140 characters lol this is good banter though!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:28:46	@foodNURD Yeah, one of my buddies thinks Raps should sign DeAndre Jordan and move JV to PF. I like DJ on my Clippers though haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:29:28	@JennAndTheCity ha will do
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:30:31	@JennAndTheCity I was going to ask if when a person knows their meal is covered if they can still have a bad date but I suppose they could
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:39:40	@JennAndTheCity Yeah I'd agree. Just double checking haha.

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 18:47:02	@sledskillz It's odd you know a person misbehaves its "apologize and go to HR training courses" an animal misbehaves gets euthanized

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 18:58:21	@MDee14 @The_Jmoney @SexyPublicidad @DannieD1 Tremendous work Marcel
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 18:59:59	@sledskillz Yeah, reading the article you'd think they'd have concluded investigation then made a move like that not before investigation
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 19:00:43	@1goatroti @The_Jmoney It's the Bengals, I think in the 3-4 years I've known Justin he's always won but I hope it's different haha

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 19:07:51	@FScottHolla Yeah, I didn't click the Vice link yet, but I saw the tweet and thought to send it along right away lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 19:14:50	@FScottHolla Listened up until the last episode. I did a dumb thing and spoiled the last episode for myself. (1/2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 19:15:23	@FScottHolla I wonder if a story with a new character will draw people in as much as the first season did? (2/2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 19:49:53	@The_Jmoney I was thinking about that the other day, I don't think we've chilled since I brought you the 6 pack at Two Bite (1/2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 19:51:05	@The_Jmoney You in Toronto often? We should meet, also last season was a push since our teams went out in same round. But yeah LMK when free
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 19:51:58	@The_Jmoney Thirdly off topic, @NBomb wanted to coordinate coming to see you in Ham at some point this summer, when do you leave for Spain?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 19:59:05	@The_Jmoney The tweet above this reads funny, even though it was a push I think it meant we both got a beer in the event of a tie?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:00:36	@Shakabrodie When is the Shakabrodie cap going to be released?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:02:14	@The_Jmoney Yeah I think the tie was the one thing we didn't discuss. But anyways this year you want to do 6 pack to whoever goes farther?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:04:22	@The_Jmoney @NBomb Sounds glorious.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:10:54	Bulls firing Thibedeau (spelling?) but Casey keeping his job in TO I don't get, same with Brooks OKC. Raps don't want to change again?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:12:22	@JennAndTheCity Depends on how well you know them ahead of time/ what you're doing on date.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:16:27	@JennAndTheCity I just mean I've been on dates where like if I get the beers/ dinner and we go grab dessert, the girl insists to pay for it
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:17:20	@teesang @JennAndTheCity Im with Christopher on this, the offering to pay even if other person insists is a good gesture
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:19:00	@foodNURD Ah that's fair then, he's a solid coach, do you think he goes to the Western Conference? Also how long of a rope is Casey on?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:20:43	@JennAndTheCity Nice! Yeah when scenarios like that happen I think it shows both parties are into each other. Lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-28 20:21:45	@foodNURD After listening to TSN radio / watching playoffs I feel like JV needs to step up this year on both sides to help Casey

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 02:20:38	9 months from now there's going to be an increase in babies named Josh thanks to DONALDSON on the Jays #legend
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 02:21:47	@GarafraxaGuy Trade him for pitching help?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 02:23:01	@jordangeville I'm an A's fan too and lately in those games I'm like "why'd we trade him for Lawrie?"
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 02:26:42	@jordangeville Definitely possible, to me there was no need to overturn the roster like they did. But it's a long season so who knows
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 02:27:00	@jordangeville Id love to see A's v Jays in the wild card game
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 02:27:34	@GarafraxaGuy That's fair. How do they fix the pitching though if not trading a bat?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 02:29:05	@IMCJasperJames God mode! I think my best mile was 9:15. How fast is yours on a treadmill? 10MPH?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 02:33:56	@IMCJasperJames 4:34 to 6:45? Cool to call you by your real name...The Flash ⚡️⚡️
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 13:39:09	@IMCJasperJames Haha right on man
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 15:01:14	@trisarahhops Too much beer...more like too much produce #amiright
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 02:44:47	Give Lundqvist a skaters stick and let him be the 6th skater!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-29 19:31:07	@TheThirstyWench Alter ego?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 15:06:43	Looking at SoMe sites you all have more adventitious lives than I do...I wish I could beer, cider and road trip as much as you #dudelessons
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 15:26:47	@RunTOBeer Well played...I'm pretty slow though like by the time I arrive at the destination you'll have run your next event 2 wks from now!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 15:28:51	Hey @BangBangLampley do you know @NBomb ? You guys should connect because of #AttentionChat and #chocolatemilkchills
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 15:31:34	The service at the bar by my house is so slow that when you order a craft beer by the time you get it it's become a big label beer
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 15:19:22	@NBomb Yeah, been trying, seems even those won't hire me because of gaps in paid employment. Doing volunteering but it's not going anywhere
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 15:20:22	Re that last tweet it should say adventurous not adventitious I don't know what that second word means haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 15:23:17	@RunTOBeer How much of a difference is it from Facebook Attending to people actually joining in person?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 20:09:36	@jet79 only positives I hope? #JTLegend
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 17:16:49	I don't know what's worse rain storm or going to chill with @An_Ju_Waals in said rain storm #comeonman
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 21:23:26	Right as the thunder ended the house began to shake...don't think we're in Kansas anymore Toto
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 23:30:34	Exceptionally well balanced brew I should buy more - Drinking a Vicar's Vice by @amsterdambeer - http://t.co/gMPfwNuIAT
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-30 23:36:14	Trying to decide which beer to drink this eve sometimes I drink the same ones because I don't want to… https://t.co/4KftSJvDRP
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 00:00:14	Every time I drink a different beer from @amsterdambeer I'm more blown away than the last one ..Vicars Vice after 7 months is gawdlike #beer
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 00:55:13	Spaghetti &amp; Meatballs with garlic bread pretty tasty dinner after an epic brew from Amsterdam… https://t.co/3vlS994BZr
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 01:37:49	Since the Beer Store is foreign owned, if they sold craft beer from the countries it's owned by would you use them for beer buying more?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 01:58:59	@saints_gambit That's my thought to like if the Beer Store sold American Craft beers like Dogfish &amp; Stone Brewing it may help their case no?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 02:05:57	Coming to the end of a good book after 5 months is bittersweet but makes me realize I'm a slow reader #TedBell #Hawke
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 02:32:08	@amsterdambeer Much love your way too, Amsterdam is an original favourite
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 02:35:16	@saints_gambit Fair point, I wanted to write a blog post of what I wish the beer industry could become, but nervous for negative feedback
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 02:37:14	@saints_gambit Yeah that's true enough. I just want the ontario beer industry to be so much more than it has been if that makes sense?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 02:42:14	Hmm Boudreau assistant coach for Leafs next season? #thingsnooneisthinking @mirtle
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 02:56:39	@saints_gambit Agreed, I actually think that's the one general way the Grocery Stores could differ from beer store &amp; each other (1/2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 02:57:33	@saints_gambit It's unlikely but imagine certain grocery chains partner with different regions like Loblaws West Coast beers and so on (2/2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 02:57:56	@saints_gambit Also cheers for engaging in this banter much appreciated
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 16:43:29	Is walking 8 km in 70 minutes good or shitty?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 17:18:30	Hitting my head on the edge of the fireplace mantle filling my dogs food bowl up is karma for the chocolate chip cookies at midnight #karma
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 17:44:24	@BangBangLampley Have you heard the song Short Change Hero by The Heavy? It's the theme for Strike Back, epic tune
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 17:53:50	@BangBangLampley Yeah great group. Them &amp; Head and Heart were first bands you told me about when we first connected on here solid bands
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 17:54:18	@BangBangLampley Strike Back is a glorious show by the way if you like counter terrorist action shows
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 17:57:57	@BangBangLampley What bands these days?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 18:00:25	@BangBangLampley Spoon is playing here end of the month, I'm between jobs but I'm thinking of getting a ticket anyways
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 18:03:38	@BangBangLampley I think $35 after tax not too bad
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 16:18:09	Fury what a movie
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 23:09:26	@NagataLockII @RusevBUL Injured? Dang he's the best
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 23:12:09	Anyone watch Strike Back? Just started the American version hooked already
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 17:44:34	Fury was solid, never been a Shia LeBouf fan but glad I saw this film #tremendous
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 19:34:03	@JennAndTheCity Were you the dots at the end or the one making the joke?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 19:35:05	But then I wondered is there more to life than sports and beer and epic TV Shows?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 20:05:07	@JennAndTheCity LOL nice
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 20:05:43	@JennAndTheCity Have you ever considered doing stand up? I lol at your tweets often
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 20:27:15	@JennAndTheCity Haha I always wanted to try stand up but I'm too nervous I'm sure you'd rock it though!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 20:28:11	@1goatroti have you connected with @BourbonThing ? She runs a bourbon club and a whiskey podcast
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 20:29:38	Playing Call of Duty World At War from 2008 on my Playstation 2. 7 years later one glorious memory from my ex is the video game LOL
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 20:42:57	@JennAndTheCity Haha maybe one day this month! I wanted to try it on a 1st date about a month back but date didn't reach that point haha.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 20:43:11	@1goatroti @BourbonThing Anytime
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 20:53:35	@beermostly Hey you post your criticism of my work in my comments section...I mean...uh...edit often and pray it flows fine
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 20:56:16	Jays must be stoked they won arbitration with DONALDSON da gawd in winter, such a steal only making $4mil and doing this #PayTheMan
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 20:57:24	@JohnPaulFutbol Call in the #DFTCA ?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 20:57:58	@BeerGirlCA @cicerone @CoolBeerBrewery Good Luck though I'm sure you'll ace it!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 20:58:45	@AndrewStoeten Valencia over Pompey you say?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 20:59:28	@JohnPaulFutbol If Bonds can do it why can't Joc Pederson?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 21:04:18	@AndrewStoeten Apologies being a knucklehead. Do you think Pompey returns prior to September?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 21:05:17	@NBomb Don't tell me you and your friends didn't get into break dance fights post release of Zoolander?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 21:12:12	@thebigpeezy I read after they blew it in the wild card v KC some of the core guys on Oak were mad Cespedes got dealt.  Beane then rebuilt
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 21:13:08	@thebigpeezy Like if you look at Oakland last year,there was no need to blow it up like they did in offseason, but in Beane we trust I guess
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 21:33:56	I'm pretty sure if I went for a jog every time I wanted chocolate id both be less afraid to go to an @RunTOBeer event &amp; in the Olympics
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 21:36:42	@thebigpeezy Yeah exactly replacing Donaldson Moss and Norris with Butler Zobrist and Ike Davis was a head scratcher
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 21:41:16	@whatthedamn This weather was making me say "What The Damn!" Lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 21:43:10	Billy Burns both his name and what he does on the base paths #Athletics #MLB
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 21:54:10	@thebigpeezy That game ended 8-7 so I doubt it. But maybe they confronted him about trading Cespedes and got the boot
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-05-31 22:00:50	@thebigpeezy Yeah, Cespedes was what stirred the success so they lost their mojo I suppose. But agree with what you said
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 21:15:57	@NBomb Have you seen this? http://t.co/pXKEM5W39G CC: @The_Jmoney @CaseP @JennAndTheCity @Toolzchick

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 02:57:47	@NagataLockII Reigns heel turn?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 02:59:32	@NagataLockII @WWERomanReigns Ah yeah I missed tonight's PPV, trying to follow on Twitter. Fair point.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 03:03:08	Anyone use a better browser than Chrome? My Chrome is horrendous
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 03:04:33	@NagataLockII Add in NXT and wrestling seems glorious these days eh.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 03:14:53	Sometimes I read wrestling sites for PPV reports bc...diehard wrestling fan...but I wonder do the writers not care about typos?(1/2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 03:15:45	I just read a report of tonight's Rollins v Ambrose Title Match and the guy doing play by play on the site was like Reigns v Amrbose MITB
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 03:16:16	Who's Amrbose and how did Reigns get a Title match when he wasn't on the PPV? #WrestlingTypos
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 03:17:13	@beermostly If I can't complain on twitter where can I complain? Also re foot injury quit kicking walls
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 03:22:04	@BangBangLampley New topic for #AttentionChat ?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 03:25:35	@BangBangLampley I promised @Jet79 I'd do this week's #AttentionChat with just questions with the letter Q...he said he wouldn't attend tho
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 03:29:49	@BangBangLampley @jet79 You've met Jimmy in person though, he's like the love child of the Hulk and Layne Stayley I wouldn't be mean to him
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 03:30:37	@JasonTO @BangBangLampley @jet79 Indeed
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 23:29:00	@FScottHolla One day ours will be on ITunes most searched too haha #GOTPodcasting
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 23:50:30	@FScottHolla Yeah certainly I'm the same way. Also after Episode 9 we should do an episode. My plans to go back and marathon before finale
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 23:52:08	Reminder this week's #AttentionChat 5 questions are about music in some way shape or form to catch your #Attention tune in at 914!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 23:52:43	Was Bush an underrated or overrated band?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 23:56:14	@NBomb Your Anti-E game is top level. Listening to Lithium on satellite they got Everything Zen on by Bush, everything is not zen though
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 00:46:37	@FScottHolla Sounds glorious man keep me posted
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 01:16:19	Q1. What bands from the early 2000s did you pay the most attention too? #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 01:20:52	A1. Limp Bizkit POD &amp; 12 Stones #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 01:22:28	Q2. Have any of the bands you listened to a decade ago remained on your playlist? #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 01:27:35	A2. None of them I cringe when I hear "Nookie" by Limp Bizkit at the gym  #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 01:28:12	Q3. If you could be a tree what type of tree would you pay attention too? #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 01:29:01	@geriatrikz Home before midnight?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 01:31:35	@geriatrikz Hopefully (if you don't already have one) you'll find your prince there!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 01:33:48	A3. A big tree  #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 01:37:17	Q4. What bands do you wish you were able to see live? #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 01:37:58	Q5. What topic do you want to discuss in next week's #AttentionChat?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 01:41:28	@JohnPaulFutbol Have you seen The Jam or just Weller on his own? #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 01:46:43	@JohnPaulFutbol Top 5 favourite comic books everyone should read? #lastweekAttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 03:21:53	@BangBangLampley You listen to Alice in Chains? #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 03:28:23	@JasonTO That one was to see if anyone was still participating at the time, but it was just me #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 03:35:20	@saints_gambit Yeah seems like a publicity stunt, what was stopping him from being "true to himself" (quotes) earlier in his life?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 03:36:43	Bonus Question: Was there a better singer than Elvis Presley? Ever? #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 03:40:21	@saints_gambit I feel like the whole thing is for attention, just bc Jenner could have done the surgery way sooner etc.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 03:43:09	@saints_gambit  That second part of your tweet is what bugs me about the whole thing. Seems like just another reason to shine light on them
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 03:48:05	@saints_gambit I mean that'd be the hope. I don't think it'll happen only because the story isn't even about Jenner's transformation (1/2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 03:48:48	@saints_gambit It's been more about "How will Jenner's family the Kardashians deal with his life change" so it misses point for bigger issue
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 03:51:37	@saints_gambit Yeah certainly. Mainstream society is a head scratcher man.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 03:55:08	@saints_gambit I guess, IMO I just don't think it comes off as a genuine thing. Like it screamed of a new angle for the shows after 10 years
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 03:57:35	@saints_gambit Just on the topic of fame, when you write the beer gospel, it's more for you to inform an audience not get RTs &amp; popularity?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 04:02:24	@saints_gambit How come you don't have your own show to go head to head with the Kardashians? You'd win I'm sure like the beer contest.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 04:05:33	@saints_gambit That's all we want on TV really though.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 13:05:46	@real_JJ Such a neat episode
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 13:07:13	@The_Jmoney @BellyMonsters @blogTO New generation of Fried Chicken spots too Eh Stockyards is vintage now.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 13:19:52	#todaysdudelesson Just because the chocolate chip cookies are on the counter doesn't mean you need to eat 4 of them...damn deliciousness
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 13:20:58	No you disregard the calories on the cookies from Costco #dudelesson
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 13:30:20	@mvp1331 You tease me...Costco is the devils store for us easily tempted types
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 13:39:13	@mvp1331 Right? Like $7.99 for 30 jumbo chocolate chip cookies is insane
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 13:41:28	@mvp1331 Basically what we can agree on is if you want to get in shape avoid Costco haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 13:45:34	Costco is actually the factory in Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory Gene Wilder version minus the umpa loompas which would be game changer
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 13:48:48	.@mvp1331 Serious question if Costco had umpa loompas as the staff would you go more frequently?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 13:58:26	@mvp1331 Yeah man and then when people get in to Costco they're always mean to each other bc of the parking lol it's a war zone of gluttony
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-01 14:08:54	@BangBangLampley TeamJared
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 13:49:49	Tonight just like every Tuesday night from 914 to 945 it's #attentionchat pls use attention in your answers rt other answers so ppl can join
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 14:06:57	@mvp1331 an equal opportunist helloer Eh? Customer Service pro
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 14:10:14	@mvp1331 nice. Try any new brews lately?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 14:18:24	@mvp1331 Never too much. Also imagine if Costco ever gets a beer license here in Ontario? Buy your beer in bulk for a good price #trouble
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 14:24:59	@mvp1331 You think the beer laws in ontario are so archaic because the government can't handle the awesomeness of what could be?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 16:14:18	@mvp1331 Ah like our current generation 18-34 demo was like "let's change things"?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 14:14:01	@NBomb Had a big discussion about this yesterday, I think if Jenner wasn't a celebrity nobody would be discussing this at all
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 14:22:31	@NBomb right like it would have been an actual struggle basically
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 14:25:59	Last nights #AttentionChat winner was @NBomb who's prize is fewer uncalled for chirps and half a thumb up #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 14:30:16	.@NBomb At #AttentionChat we do things half way, hence 5 Qs over 10 and 30 mins instead of an hour to chat and you only answered 2.5 Qs
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 14:32:25	@NBomb The whole point of the chat is to be silly and put attention in your answers #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 14:35:09	Next weeks #AttentionChat is canceled due to Im moving on with my life...be back in 6 months though
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 14:42:55	@BangBangLampley This is Zelda time for me so 6 months for me is like 2 weeks for anyone else. Also I need a life so time to move on
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 17:42:18	Hooray to looking human again #haircut #goodtimes #beardmission #glorious #aweyeah #AttentionChat https://t.co/rLOt2EdLtl
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 17:56:48	Shayne Greene has that get cut by Detroit end up in Toronto become this year's Brandon McCarthy type of vibe to him #Baseball
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 18:04:14	For my Toronto beer loving followers check this out a 'craft beer passport' http://t.co/Gujmm1uCrY @DoodleBrews24 can go on tour! #Beerme
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 15:01:18	Cut or uncut going to a stand up comedy open mic on your own both to watch/participate?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 19:23:17	@craftbeerpass @RevivalBarTO Just watched the video on your site, the production is amazing, shout out to your marketing team!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 19:27:19	@craftbeerpass @franticrenegade @TinyMuha Awesome! Yeah I need to invest in one this year, your video sold me on it!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 19:29:58	Jesse Hahn's really improved from April to May, guy's going to be good in Oak's rotation for a couple years I think! #Athletics
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 19:21:13	@mvp1331 Agree on everything especially the job front. With the Econ crash I think most of us out of work folk are like beer jobs please
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 19:34:39	@craftbeerpass Next year will you be adding bars North of Bloor for us midtown craft beer enthusiasts?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 20:06:27	Otero more like Oh NOO! #Athletics
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 19:46:31	Sepp Blatter out John Oliver in? #FIFA
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 19:49:19	That last RT was legendary that guy won #AttentionChat before it even began tonight good on @NBomb for RTing it first
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 19:51:02	@foodieyu OMG I want it all...is it the best fried chicken you've had?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 19:57:57	@TheThirstyWench You use a FitBit to track all your steps?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 19:59:27	@foodieyu Oh strong praise! I hope if I go they live up to your praise :)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 20:00:42	@TheThirstyWench All those stops is definitely at least 10,000 steps I want to say
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 20:01:04	@BangBangLampley Dang it now I want to blog #wellplayed
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 20:02:35	@NBomb The one about being a white male = jobs galore by the Mr.lonelychaser handle
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 20:03:48	@TheThirstyWench You'd be correct lol 10 miles you reckon?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 20:04:43	@NBomb yeah, if I had a nickel for every time someone told me I'd get hired bc of my race/ religion I could start my own business
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 20:10:06	@NBomb Yeah almost at two years without anything stable it's murdering me slowly but Eh at least I can get in shape while I wait lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 20:12:51	@NBomb Trade places?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-02 20:26:22	Still trying to get in shape when you are sick is tough but someone has to do it #dudelesson
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 16:58:02	@The_Jmoney @KrisGoetz @by_simone Is that due to being pals as much as both are exceptional writers?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 16:58:39	@NoahvdL Isn't the highway thing risky though? I look at it more as a safety than anti bike rights thing
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 16:59:24	@The_Jmoney @KrisGoetz @by_simone That's fair.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 17:09:04	Son a beer is a lot like a woman they look good they smell good &amp; you'd step over your own mother just to get one! #homersimpson #beerwisdom
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 21:54:58	Diet Mountain Dew Hmm never tried we'll see
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 22:01:15	Some dude at my local 711 just tried to pick a fight w/ me over who was first in line. I didn't care enough &amp; let him go first lol crazy ppl
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 22:05:54	Nobody takes a guy in sandals with a slurpee from 711 seriously when they're picking a fight #dudelesson
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 22:21:43	Anyone watch #StrikeBack ? Almost done Season 1, if you like espionage shows it is one Id highly recommend! #TVShows
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 22:27:44	@FScottHolla this looks like a story someone would send you haha  https://t.co/CLXxQWzbre
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 17:18:14	Has anyone checked in on @JasonTO or @GrumpyOldSport since The French Open began?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 02:53:10	@Shakabrodie http://t.co/oti25qGUij re number 4 on this list why do people keep the sticker on their hats after buying them?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 02:53:43	@The_Jmoney Became a Toronto sports fan?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 03:19:18	@Shakabrodie I read the whole list &amp; all I got from it is that the author needs to go for a run since theyre way to angry at society #health
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 03:20:10	This is a tremendous reason #Wellplayed  https://t.co/VLWRPgYIw8
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 03:24:07	@LenaRadio Discount on any?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 03:24:58	@keely4204 This was brilliant/ well said.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 18:38:32	Better Thin Lizzy track Massacre or Emerald? #Epic70sJams
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 18:48:05	@PokerDave04 Have you heard Mastadon's version of Emerald? It's quite exceptional
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 19:02:41	@PokerDave04 Yeah there's a version on YouTube where Mastadon is joined by one of the original Thin Lizzy guitarists for Emerald it's great
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 19:11:57	New at 3Cheers I wrote about the legend of #AttentionChat &amp; how to try and get out of a rut 
http://t.co/9anhtPyI89 #3Cheers #RutFixer
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-03 19:14:26	@by_simone @The_Jmoney @KrisGoetz This is delayed I love your blogs too actually all 3 of your blogs are the only ones on my RSS thingy!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:10:06	I can't be the only one wanting this NBA Final to go the full 7 games can I? #CavsWarriors
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:12:02	@efronb You make him go in the meat locker like the freezer scene in Rocky and work on his stamina?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:13:41	@efronb How's your team fairing this year so far?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:39:56	@efronb Nice man that's fantastic.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:42:14	@AmandaBlake9 Apparently they used to be more specific but took flack for it so they grouped everything under that one term.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:44:04	@AmandaBlake9 Also i think in that specific story the guy wasn't breaking into her apartment just to grope her.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:45:37	@AmandaBlake9 That's fair, can I ask why you don't agree? (For conversation / curiousity sake on my end not being argumentative)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:46:16	@TheThirstyWench Did you do the whole craft beer passport walk already??
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:47:11	As someone that loves both beer and chocolate, what are some 'healthy' but equally delicious vices you'd recommend instead?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:47:44	@AmandaBlake9 That's fair have a good eve, hope i didn't offend re curiousity!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:48:14	@TheThirstyWench Oh nice! That sounds like a glorious stroll!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:49:11	@BangBangLampley Apparently in Oregon this brewery called Rogue came out with a bacon doughnut beer, I haven't tried it yet but OMG
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:50:14	@BangBangLampley One sec I'll find you the link to it.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:50:21	@TheThirstyWench Was it 11 miles round trip? That sounds pretty fantastic.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:51:20	@BangBangLampley http://t.co/yc06gz0Ldb yeah i couldn't wrap my head around such a thing.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:53:01	@TheThirstyWench Speaking of walking, I kind of want to attempt to walk half of beer passport stops too. I'm North of bloor so quite a hike
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:53:43	@TheThirstyWench wow that's awesome, good for you. Completely off topic, have you seen the trailer for Fallout 4 yet?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 02:57:41	@TheThirstyWench @craftbeerpass Yeah I'm up in North York, but I'm thinking i'd TTC to the Junction then work my way east lol.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 03:00:25	@BangBangLampley Whatever happened to that hashtag?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 03:04:25	Hey @RunTOBeer will there be runs to different locations on @craftbeerpass this summer?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 03:12:00	@RunTOBeer @craftbeerpass Oh that's glorious! Would you do them in groups? Like 5 bars in one run crawl then another day same idea?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 03:15:10	@RunTOBeer @craftbeerpass  I feel like this passport would also bring out a ton of newbies (like me) since don't want to drink alone haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 03:18:08	@trisarahhops @BangBangLampley What's your favourite beer food collaboration ale thingy Sarah?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 03:21:07	@RunTOBeer @craftbeerpass Sounds like the dream! Unrelated are you guys working on any collab beers with any breweries? Like a RunTO IPA?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 03:21:59	@trisarahhops Hmm couldn't you keep bottle even if you pour out the beer? Also does that kind of style expire?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 03:24:16	@trisarahhops @BangBangLampley Collab like bacon and beer.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 03:40:28	@RunTOBeer Hahaha fair. Also who would I contact to write about your group on my blog @doodlebrews24 ?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 03:42:38	@trisarahhops @BangBangLampley Actually the most risque collab I've had was a Chocolate Milk Stout from Wellington Brewery, it was delicious
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 03:43:04	@RunTOBeer @DoodleBrews24 I'll send you something now.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 04:04:13	@trisarahhops Are you grabbing a Craft beer passport ?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 04:19:24	@trisarahhops Ah true, yeah it's good for 6 months until end of November so lots of time if you do decide to get one haha! #Beerchat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 03:48:08	@JohnPaulFutbol Completely unrelated, no #AttentionChat next week
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 02:30:35	@corey_erdman Just heard you on the fight network commercial #Legend
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 02:32:02	Watching Impact Wrestling did James Storm just murder Mickie James? #TNA this seems like end of the road WCW territory.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 03:42:39	@JohnPaulFutbol Can they pick up 6 instead and just rough him up a little bit with an 0 for 12 in the series? #OaklandAs
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 13:18:28	@mvp1331 YouTube link or it never happened!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 13:19:01	@AmandaBlake9 You as well have an epic weekend!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 13:24:06	What's a periscope and will it get me more beer?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 13:24:48	@mvp1331 I don't know what that means
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 13:34:45	@NBomb Those types never get any respect
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 13:39:37	@NBomb Liberal arts the no respect degrees
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 13:51:35	@NBomb What's a history degree fall under, just arts or liberal arts ?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:00:19	@NBomb Yeah that's my animosity for my radio degree didn't get a job but now I've got OSAP to pay off when it feels like school was a waste
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:09:23	@NBomb I feel that way too, I majored in production instead of on air so it's even tougher to get a production job out of town
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:16:23	@NBomb oh I'd go anywhere it's just a matter of getting the chance
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:21:39	Shout out to this family friend that stops by every Friday with a fresh loaf of bread and the sports section in the Toronto Sun!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:27:50	Where would one go to buy grubby/schlepping clothes to do work around the house? Walmart?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:31:09	@JennAndTheCity I feel like this is something I'd only wear if I didn't like the couple getting married haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:33:02	@BangBangLampley You sir are the oracle from the Matrix an answer for everything...much appreciated
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:34:28	@JennAndTheCity @traxedo LOL nice! For a project in radio school I once wore a shirt with tuxedo lines on it &amp; a bow as my "fancy clothes"
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:38:51	@Shakabrodie @susanslusser I want to know if they make a pitching change &amp; He goes from lefty to righty does he get the warm ups for both?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:41:59	@PortiaCorman I've wondered that exact thing past few times. Makes me wonder if you can read your dates mind can you make the date better?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:43:00	@JennAndTheCity Re good time bad time on 1st dates, if you could read your dates mind or vice versa would you to make a bad date turn good?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:44:27	@clickflickca You mean instead of send you mean tweets for no reason, this is what people should do?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:46:08	It seems odd to me when people I follow who also follow me just favourite my tweets but never tweet to me or respond when I tweet them
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:47:09	@clickflickca LA Lakers #MeanTweets
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:51:16	@Moketronics Maybe but it seems weird to fav a tweet then when you try &amp; engage that person they just ignore you
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:53:33	@Moketronics yeah totally. I don't know I like social media for the talking not brand promoting so to not engage sometimes annoys me lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 14:59:13	@KrisGoetz Daisy got a head dress?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 15:04:27	@PortiaCorman Yeah I think that way too. If i'm not into them in the first 20 minutes I know it's not meant to be.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 15:05:26	I was going to do an FF for the first time in ages but all my followers ALREADY follow each other so FF to everyone?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 15:16:31	@KrisGoetz Also re your blog from the other day, I'm pretty certain if I didn't read your blog with regularity my tunes wouldn't be so rad!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 15:32:27	@KrisGoetz yeah big fan of your work!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 13:27:03	No what they said what they meant for 3 months?? Feel better soon @MikeRichardsTSN we Macko &amp; Cauz diehards need @mcauz56 back soon!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 17:08:37	@JennAndTheCity that's a fair point, but I suppose it would be good if you were having a good time but couldn't tell how other person felt?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 17:08:59	@JennAndTheCity the you in the last tweet was you in general not you specifically
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 17:09:38	I've learnt the past few days the word "you" is a bad descriptor for most talking points
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 18:09:48	Time for new pals? #AttentionChat #cheatday #chills #comeon #bad #comedy #novine https://t.co/LVvMUrhPSJ

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 14:25:02	@NBomb NO You *pointy finger emoticon*
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-06 13:11:18	@gazalle @OntScienceCtr This sounds awesome was it glorious?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 18:40:36	@BangBangLampley if I send someone an email to work on blog together and they don't get back to me I guess that's a response of no isn't it?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 19:35:59	@BangBangLampley heard from them luckily! Blog post should be up Tuesday woot
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 16:05:12	How come every time I workout I want a Double Shack from Shake Shack after? #getfitfatman
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 16:08:20	If Shake Shack ever comes to Toronto it'll be a game changer for sure
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 16:14:32	It's been a while since you've dropped a #heeltweet  https://t.co/m9IGfwkegZ
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 16:15:20	@BangBangLampley The Target thing was dumb like I think people actually believed we'd get recession era American prices &amp; not Ontario prices
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 16:17:12	There's a reason why the bottom of your foot is called the soul it's because you're a runner #Nike LOL
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 16:18:25	@BangBangLampley Right, but in Ontario we get taxed on everything...you can't talk to anyone or you'll get taxed by the city #butnotreally
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 16:23:18	@BangBangLampley Yeah we've got a tax that's 5% and then a second tax on the SAME ITEM that's 11-13% it's crazy
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 16:25:55	@BangBangLampley Bigger question have you had Shake Shack? Maybe the best burger I forgot to photo my only regret really
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 16:31:43	@The_Jmoney Haha I read this last night like 5 times wasn't sure if I offended you. Brilliant work as always though your rant is dead on.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 16:32:34	@BangBangLampley You need to road trip if you love burgers like you love the Lions it'll change your life
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 16:34:22	@The_Jmoney last tweet should say at the end "thought your rant was dead on" stupid auto correct
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 16:35:28	@TipsyTeachers Your hard work has gone a long way!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 16:36:41	@UncredRewrite why did they cancel it were we the only two watching it? The Following was good up until the Dexter style series finale
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-04 16:39:46	@UncredRewrite I wonder if in 10 years on some social media device people are talking about how The Following was an under appreciated show
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-05 21:32:38	When buying new beer how do you decide what to drink right away and what to save for a rainy day/ age? #beerhelp

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-07 01:52:37	When you realize the beer you just chugged is 9% and you sneeze and your brain feels like beer it's how i imagine being punched must feel
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-07 02:03:55	@thebigpeezy Just chugged most of a bottle of Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA. didn't realize it was 9% goes down too smooth
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-07 02:08:05	@thebigpeezy Hmm I'm quite jealous, spur of the moment trip? Also you think we'll ever get American craft beer specific stores here in TO?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-07 02:09:16	My hipster beef with the beer store would subside if they'd just sell American craft beers in part of their stores, a guy can dream right?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-06 21:54:09	@BangBangLampley Well worth it

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-07 02:15:09	@thebigpeezy Ah solo trip? That sounds like a lot of fun.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-07 02:15:46	@thebigpeezy Yeah imagine just a store dedicated to Beer Advocate's top 250 of all time list, I'd be thrilled haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-07 02:20:29	@thebigpeezy @dogfish_ale Hmm they've got a few ales and porters, heck they've got a Pearl Jam beer called Faithful Ale it's a Belgian style

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 03:01:25	@UncredRewrite Still hating on hockey eh. Is this the best NBA Final of all time? Top 5 worthy at least no?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 03:02:04	@real_JJ Definitely top 3 ever since i've been alive
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 04:02:18	From reading @Taz34TO social media pages, I'm certain he'd be that uncle that takes your son to a strip club when he's of age

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:10:07	@The_Jmoney Did you go? I feel like these festivals under estimate the expectation the customers have, which is whacky to say the least
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:11:23	@CPantazis Haha good point. I was going to say gym but it's gross out
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:13:15	@The_Jmoney Wrestling beers? https://t.co/WEQygsFgeF
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:15:59	@The_Jmoney undersell I don't understand, isn't that the issue right there they never have enough food for the amount of ppl
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:18:13	@The_Jmoney yeah wow holy smokes. Was their no communication between vendors and organizers so enough food would be made?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:20:06	@CPantazis There's all these articles about ppl that workout in their offices but I can't imagine that actually happens (1/2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:21:06	@CPantazis to me when you've got an office your job makes you too busy to workout in your office, nobody bicep curls case files do they? (2)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:35:34	Lol at the head of the TTC calling out his own organization just tremendous
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:36:20	@clickflickca @CP24 Right? When the head dude doesn't even know what's going on that's not a good thing
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:39:38	@corey_erdman That Grade 10 photo is tremendous you still rock all white suits? Also do you have fedoras?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:40:54	@clickflickca Absolutely, but also that statement by Colle makes him look just as incompetent as the signal comm guys for TTC
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:42:06	@The_Jmoney @D_V_D_V_R actually never heard of him prior to this beer epicness
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:44:52	@The_Jmoney @D_V_D_V_R Oh wow! I was more of a PWTorch / PWinsider guy back then ever read those sites?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:45:58	@whatthedamn But what's Twitter for if not to vent/ link to epic awesomeness?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:47:58	@The_Jmoney @1goatroti there's your apology  https://t.co/MvMg9tvT9Z
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:52:21	Between Mac n Cheese fiasco fest and TTC fail leading to Uber cash grab, I'm thinking it's good I work from home &amp; walk everywhere #TOFail
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:54:04	@The_Jmoney Yeah Torch I read only for  Pat's projections of how he'd book PPVs besides that I read PWInsider &amp; your tweets for wrestling
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:56:21	@RunTOBeer @mikkellerrc The one guy with his dog is tremendous, I'm surprised more pet loving runners haven't joined yet
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:57:49	@The_Jmoney @Wreddit Will do, do you listen to any wrestling podcasts? I'm hoping to do an episode on the squared circle for my own podcast
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 14:59:28	@The_Jmoney @Wreddit @JRsBBQ @IAmJericho Art of Wrestling is one Id recommend too
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-07 14:53:34	@Freeroll4life Haha probably right, that hesitation by Cotto to respond to Kellerman's question about Triple G was better than the fight
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 15:54:39	@whatthedamn Haha that's fair
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 15:55:39	@TheBarleyBabe Haha was some dude who won a Tony Award, when I saw his name was Sam Gold I wondered if he drank as epic beer
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 15:57:10	@TheBarleyBabe But to be fair is anyone? Actually getting to meet you is part of the opening for an upcoming blog post I'm writing haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 15:57:47	@NBomb Start your own?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 15:58:35	@The_Jmoney Yeah I'm trying to think of another good set of episodes, the production is pretty solid on it though
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 16:41:18	@mvp1331 Just take your dogs to work?

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 02:17:35	Little cocky to play "I'm the Man" by Aloe Blacc for LeBron before he wins his 3rd title in 5 years no? #NBA #Savagepowermove
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 02:18:06	@412TJ Ah yes the end of this one was quite exceptional.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 02:18:34	@ROKR_CHIK Saw the dress on IG stunning! Also congrats on your win!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 02:21:41	@412TJ Yeah, first half started slow, but from like 6 on wards they've gone hard. Can't believe it'll be 10 next week already.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-08 02:42:42	@clickflickca @KingJames LeBron needs no Big 3  he's freaking LeBron!

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 19:42:01	@JennAndTheCity Ah that sounds annoying. Sorry you have to go through that. Tone down the epicness? LOL (bad joke)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 19:50:06	@JennAndTheCity haha if anything you'll be twice as epic haha :)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 19:52:30	@CaseP @BLACKS Got mine at Costco #thedream
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 19:56:57	If there's a worse random pain than a toe cramp I want to know what it is?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 19:57:29	@CaseP Are you telling me the STRUGGLE IS REAL?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 19:59:15	@BeerGirlCA Any plans to sell your home brew / need a taste tester for a third opinion? @TheBarleyBabe
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:00:07	@BangBangLampley Lies that's not pain that's morbid
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:00:34	@NBomb @CaseP Wouldn't be the first time nor the last.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:01:42	@BeerGirlCA @TheBarleyBabe Haha tweet me if you need a taste tester. Is it bad I want to do the Cicerone exam so I can be a pro taste tester
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:02:59	No more playoff beards in sports is like saying you hate chocolate milk in beer...just wrong very wrong
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:03:38	@sincerelysab How many photos/ likes before you came to this decision? I'm bailing at 400 photos lol
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:10:32	@JennAndTheCity Have you connected with  @Toolzchick she's just as epic as you! And knows @NBomb haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:11:09	@sincerelysab Not a foodie?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:13:01	@NBomb @CaseP Don't you chirp Casey about being in the Stone Age he'll hit you with a tripod from 1995
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:05:00	@BangBangLampley Joining for #AttentionChat tonight?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:07:11	@mvp1331 I just shake my head because I don't believe in the idea that special beers can improve your overall fitness.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:09:43	@BangBangLampley Also re your tweets sounding angry...grab a snickers man!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:16:18	@mvp1331 Yeah that's my thought too. I'm interviewing a beer runner later today for @DoodleBrews24 plan to ask him about it
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:18:12	@mvp1331 @DoodleBrews24 Yep! Is there ONBeerChat this eve too?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:21:43	@mvp1331 @AThibert Nice I'll try to read  along!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:23:57	Tonight's #AttentionChat topic is video games! Be sure to tune in at 9:14 and leave by 9:45! Fastest Twitter chat 5qs 5as be sure to Fv &amp; RT
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:28:26	@JennAndTheCity You still the queen of chicken wings? Asking for a friend
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:29:59	It's finally Summer as OCB Week starts Friday and ends next Friday be sure to drink at a craft beer bar &amp; ask your bartender for a macro
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:32:56	Re last tweet about asking your craft bartender for a macro beer, I suggest that for the pure comedy that ensues
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:34:20	Typically when a craft beer bar has a sign that says "craft beer only" they definitely don't have Labatt or Molson products but why ask?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:39:28	@JennAndTheCity It needs to be socially acceptable to have wings for breakfast haha id eat them
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:40:43	Instead of a shake/smoothie for breakfast I really want wings or a bucket from KFC...too early?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:42:10	@JennAndTheCity Just to nerd out for a minute, first thing in the morning are you a hot wings or flavour based wings winger?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:15:26	Lobster nachos yeah or ney?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:17:16	@Moketronics I'm thinking the same lobster rolls are glorious for instance
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:23:23	@TheBarleyBabe mentioned you in my blog post with @BrewScout on @DoodleBrews24 check it!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:25:06	@Emi_the_Rose @Moketronics I've never had nachos sober so I can't tell if I'd like them with lobster haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:26:35	@CaseP @NBomb head tilting face?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:29:16	I feel like the Toronto craft beer scene caters to the south of Bloor beer enthusiast. Any epic craft breweries/ bars in the North? #beerme
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:29:53	@CaseP @NBomb it should become a GIF for any time I tweet you or Nick haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:31:02	@sincerelysab LOL your comedy game is Rodney Dangerfield level
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 20:34:44	@Emi_the_Rose @Moketronics Now I want nachos
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 22:32:43	@sincerelysab Ha perhaps! Although food can be funny no?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 22:33:57	Massive dog walk think I'm in zombie mode!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 22:40:15	@JennAndTheCity Beer! Wine is good when you're done building it! 😉🍻🍻
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:43:55	@mvp1331 I'm not sure, my local got replaced by a bank/ A&amp;W. Also is it bad I had a local KFC but not a local bar?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:45:26	@NBomb @JennAndTheCity Wait you went from talking about Fajitas and Nachos to salad? Are you going to talk about your feelings now NB? #heel
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 14:47:50	@NBomb @JennAndTheCity Chicken Finger salads? Get the tissues?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 15:01:35	@JennAndTheCity Have you been to All Stars up in Markham? They've got flavours based on the heat it's epic
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 15:36:09	@JennAndTheCity be yourself easier said than done haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 00:28:02	@sincerelysab of course!

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-09 16:02:21	@JennAndTheCity Not sure, but they're like your former Twitter handle AWESOME!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 13:59:38	@seanbeckingham Haha Yep. I was thinking of bailing on the whole social media thing, 96 tweets for casual chatting seemed bananas
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 14:24:27	#todaysdudelesson When trying to meet your FitBit goal remember you can spread it out over a day instead of killing 2 hours for cardio #sore

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 01:29:17	Q3. Half way through #AttentionChat what do you think of this week's topic: Video Games?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 01:30:37	Q4. Xbox One just upgraded their memory option to a Terabyte is that too much memory for video games? #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 01:35:22	A4. Hmm terabyte is pretty huge but I imagine you can keep more than just games like music and movies but not beer sadly #AttentionChat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 01:36:03	A3. Video games is a solid topic wish more people would nerd out with us though!  #AttentionChat

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 17:27:58	@TheThirstyWench Hasn't happened yet...are you keeping the epic American beer for yourself??
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 17:30:06	@TheThirstyWench Dang I need to leave my house for more than just FitBit steps haha *jogs to a bar*
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 17:31:14	It's crazy to think a few inches higher and maybe they would have gone back to back Smoak will take the two RBI though #Jays
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 17:31:50	Sometimes I wonder what new bands I should check out then I remember I need to binge listen to @soundopinions

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 01:58:29	Been seeing lots of home brew photos/ videos on my social media, might be time to learn how to make a Doodle Brew @DoodleBrews24 #homebrew
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 02:23:31	Watching women's soccer over NBA Finals, can't help but feel like this game should have a quicker pace/ more goals to it. Too defensive.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 02:28:39	@CPantazis @JennAndTheCity Feel better ladies! Anything some epic soup and cyber hugs can cure?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 02:31:38	If there's one thing I've learnt from listening to George Thorogood and the Destroyers it's that I don't drink enough bourbon or scotch
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 02:33:22	@JennAndTheCity LOL nice! But also lame re sick, I saw your tweet about even your hair hurting, you okay old buddy?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 02:36:27	@NBomb @BrilynnF It's a few years later, I kind of long for Poutine &amp;  never had a burrito, hope you're both well https://t.co/twllVlHG4W
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 02:43:26	@NBomb Yeah I actually haven't had a poutine since that day way back in 2012, but when you and @CaseP &amp; I went to Hurricanes it looked epic
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 02:52:17	@NBomb @CaseP George Thorogood wrote a song about me it's called "One bourbon One Scotch One Beer"
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 20:14:33	Anyone know a quick daily way to improve core strength? Back is dying on runs #fithelp
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 20:15:55	@sincerelysab God help this city with Councillors like that. How do they get voted in??

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 20:20:43	@keely4204 Ha well luckily you're okay as a fan I need your words to read and to do to detox yoga at breweries vicariously through your IG
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 20:22:32	@sincerelysab yeah if it leads to de congestion and progress im all for it. But if it's for a councillors cruise or weight loss I'm not game
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 20:23:09	@seanbeckingham You're bananas?
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 20:24:57	They really need an edit tweet option on here I've deleted some gems I could have just edited #tweetfail

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 03:21:49	@SoundOfSexton @HBO You must hate GOT too then right? I stopped after season 1 for Deadwood.
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 03:31:20	It's odd to think if Canada didn't get that controversial PK v China they could be 3rd in the group thanks to tonight's result #WorldCup
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 03:43:10	I like LeBron and all his impressive statistics but I'm glad GSW woke up and realized they're the best team in the league #NBAFinals
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 21:45:34	@BangBangLampley Man when I had one on Friday I thought I won the Super Bowl!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 21:50:56	@NBomb Don't think so I wondered the same thing
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-10 21:53:04	@NBomb Yep. It's infuriating to say the least

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 14:19:26	@mikelipsius yeah I never go not because I'm some anti festival person but rather don't have the $$ to afford it. One year I will though
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-11 13:15:32	@UncredRewrite LeBron wouldn't take the day off on one leg!
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-11 13:38:27	@UncredRewrite I guess for what he makes he can hobble haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 17:25:23	Im not saying  powers that be can see these but tweeting criticism about local transit &amp; then getting Tsunami'd by a bus during storm is odd

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 18:49:51	@NBomb Yep, I was walking up a hill from my gym and a bus came roaring by and destroyed me. Been sniffling sneezing since FML
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 18:50:48	@NBomb Also re why were you walking home in a rainstorm...I left my bus fare at home thinking I'd avoid the storm but nope
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 18:54:02	Dear @WhitneyMayes if you need a cookie taste tester who likes the Leafs call me #eatthecookies #gawdlike
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 18:55:41	@NBomb Yeah I thought I could save gas by walking/ jogging to and from gym. Rain wasn't a pain, but bus/ other ppl on street were haha

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 21:50:26	I've fought it for years but I think I'm as much a Jays as I am an Oakland fan, can they just play in the ALCS so I'm more torn come on MLB!

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-13 00:20:54	Watching Cops on Spike instead of Jays less painful
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-13 00:25:59	@jordangeville Yeah with that high an ERA and plus how he wasn't hitting his spots today may need to go down and work it out

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-13 03:11:22	@Freeroll4life @VoiceOfBeard I feel like a TKO 3 would have got the same point across of Lara being 10times better than Rodriguez but Eh
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-14 03:40:00	@JennAndTheCity LOL there's an ungentlemanly joke in there not appropriate for Twitter haha
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 19:26:30	@CaseP auto corrected...I tried to hide under the money trees (see previous tweet for reference)
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 13:44:11	@SoundOfSexton Highly recommend it. This Sunday is the season finale for 5th season, and they don't return until April 2016 time to binge

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 19:35:34	@1goatroti @CaseP a #heeltweet is when someone says something in jest but it comes off cheeky. #heeltweetchat is the scheduled hashtag chat
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 19:38:22	@1goatroti @CaseP I guess but this is mainly comedic in nature like an "oh snap" or "smart guy Eh?" Reaction A Hole sounds mean
207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-12 19:49:17	@1goatroti @CaseP You're not offended are you?

207723801	E_Freeds	2015-06-15 12:59:48	@Freeroll4life That ending was super lame. I felt like the shock would have been Ollie saving Jon instead of final death blow in Coup
