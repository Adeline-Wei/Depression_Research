21177788	Noam25	2013-02-21 01:45:50	It's true. 20 years ago I starred in a film opposite Julian Fellowes where I sang in Yiddish &amp; slapped him about with a dead rat. #downton
21177788	Noam25	2013-02-21 01:53:49	@jennifer_ehle I  ran away from school to Scotland alongside Anthony Calf, Steven McKintosh &amp; Julian. I played a Jewish ghost taking revenge
21177788	Noam25	2013-02-21 16:51:00	@jennifer_ehle it was a strange career blip! Am waiting for pictures of chickens and snow btw... Possibly together. Lqnd xxx

21177788	Noam25	2013-02-21 21:04:38	#LA moments #43 a girl ran past me on while I hiked clutching an Oscar. She presented it to Adele, who was doing a photoshoot.
21177788	Noam25	2013-02-17 06:03:56	Here's a poem my dad wrote for me when I was four. It might explain why I am who I am. I WAS FOUR! #ahf… http://t.co/yrhPkmQy

21177788	Noam25	2014-08-29 15:15:39	@Daniel_Knauf you are/were unique. No interviewee has ever but ever asked me questions ... Nor have they googled me. I was honoured.
21177788	Noam25	2014-08-29 15:17:31	@Daniel_Knauf which is what makes your writing so informed and so inspiring ... Would that there were more like you.
21177788	Noam25	2014-08-29 15:40:31	@Axxman300 @annabdavid @imlaurahouse if you could see where I am right now you would change your tune ...

21177788	Noam25	2014-08-28 18:46:52	Urgh. That feeling when you watch a squirrel being hit by a car, fly across crescent heights, and then get squished by another car. #notfun
21177788	Noam25	2014-08-29 14:13:32	@Jesse_Spencer I was actually thinking of bringing the squirrel over to yours. I know you love fresh meat.
