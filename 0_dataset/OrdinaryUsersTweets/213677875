213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 21:20:21	@bloodygoodrep shame he missed the eagle but he's in the mix, -12 wins
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 21:57:31	@bloodygoodrep this is anyones
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-13 21:51:13	@bloodygoodrep  not aware of his work, I'll look him up! Jose mourinho said him at man city is impossible! Utd next for him
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-13 22:00:47	@bloodygoodrep just caught that video, very funny man!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-13 22:09:47	@bloodygoodrep saw that one and the educated accent on live at the Apollo, both great
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-19 19:18:06	@bloodygoodrep he epitomises all of that german efficiency and poise that makes them such a functional nation
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-08 14:40:11	@bloodygoodrep fantastic response. Perhaps others could take a leaf out of his book, he doesn't play "the game"
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-09 17:39:53	@bloodygoodrep RMcI has the game, he has the bottle but when tiger charges it's an irresistible force. Like to see woods prove a point!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 20:41:03	@bloodygoodrep he's in with a shout, Donald/Cabrera pairing either could win
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 20:44:50	@bloodygoodrep I can see that. Intersting fact, he studied art history in America on uni scholarship
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 20:54:24	@bloodygoodrep I would love to see how that meeting would pan out. Donald prob speaks more Spanish than pennant/Campbell does English
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 21:09:34	@bloodygoodrep RMc took 7 at 10th, woods has eagle put for lead
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 21:38:13	@bloodygoodrep I'd cry if I crumbled like that
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-13 21:21:19	@bloodygoodrep fantastic for all football fans, just a shame they can't meet in the final. Fancy a schalke upset too
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-29 10:53:35	Shouldn't the queen be singing the national anthem?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-02 10:31:05	Oh dear America what have you done?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-19 17:07:48	@bloodygoodrep massively jealous of your tickets! Have a good time
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-20 22:08:33	Jose Mourinho does it again, genius!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 19:12:38	@bloodygoodrep woods hasn't given up yet! Chances?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 20:17:30	@bloodygoodrep difficult not to buckle when he storms up the leaderboard like that, he still had his presence
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 20:20:27	@bloodygoodrep in the pressure cooker situation he seems to think clearer and even feel at home. True champion
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 20:26:16	@bloodygoodrep sounds very dodgy! Good for LFC if you don't want KD, Baldini shouldn't be involved in this stuff though!!!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 20:31:45	@bloodygoodrep yes, great team to watch and plenty of goals. Think his youth would help him, no fear
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 20:37:41	@bloodygoodrep @marcotti VB would breath new life in to LFC and has a great future, would he choose Italy to prove JM wrong?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 21:00:25	@bloodygoodrep only person who will not win masters now is RMc, wheels have come off
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 21:29:28	@bloodygoodrep Rory will need a stretcher by the 18th
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-10 22:15:47	@bloodygoodrep his to loose. My eye lids are winning the battle though! Poor Rory
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-13 21:45:28	@bloodygoodrep german football will be a super power very soon. As @Marcotti said they have a balance between supporters/economics/youth
213677875	dannolan84	2011-04-13 22:21:16	@bloodygoodrep nice touch. Twitter the future!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-02 12:50:34	@bloodygoodrep NHCC BBQ today at 6pm if you fancy it? Meet the pro too
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-02 13:44:38	@bloodygoodrep yes I will be driving, probably straight from my sisters
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-05 08:19:45	@themichaelowen any tips for Chester today/tomorrow?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-05 09:27:28	@natasiamoore sounds a good tip that. Might be worth a couple of quid!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-06 23:25:31	@natasiamoore fortunately I had a look at the horse and decided against it! We will have to study more for the next meeting!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-07 22:54:15	@johntheleopard  @bloodygoodrep watched motd in club with Palmer, we can't believe how they don't make more of his ability. Awesome today!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-07 22:59:50	@Marcotti that's what British football is up against. Lunatics running the asylum !
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-07 23:02:38	@johntheleopard yeah Ashley young did celebrate like that. 2 match bad like @WayneRooney as the FA always stick to their guns!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-08 20:45:40	@johntheleopard @themichaelowen park was outstanding with Valencia. Find it an 'easy' decision to continually eulogise over giggs
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-08 20:48:16	@Marcotti are you going to watch Lord Sugar's show on tackling football debt? Everyone is passing the buck!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-08 20:59:46	@bloodygoodrep @tscollymore german financial model is excellent. Their structure of clubs too. Lord Sugar may have opened a can of worms?!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-08 21:01:43	@bloodygoodrep @johntheleopard their mentally! They have no one to answer to anymore as manger takes all the blame?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-08 21:14:33	@johntheleopard @bloodygoodrep who was better, giggs today or Gibson Wednesday? Don't remember them gushing over gibbo?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-08 21:20:29	@bloodygoodrep @johntheleopard finally Lee Dixon has notice park played today
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-08 21:23:04	@bloodygoodrep @johntheleopard I assume and I guess giggs does a lot off the pitch means they don't know! Talking bollocks
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-08 22:15:03	@johntheleopard @rioferdy5 park definitely best player on the pitch! Impossible to mark drifting inside
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-09 08:16:13	@bloodygoodrep difference is he held his position defensively but drifted offensively making it hard to mark
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-09 21:27:09	@themichaelowen even if all U21 players excel (like Germans) only wilshere will play euro 2012, so what's the point in him going?....
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-09 21:28:08	@themichaelowen the idea is that he should learn tournament football but il will be with players he'll never play with next year!!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-09 21:31:03	@Marcotti as usual it's lazy/easy journalism, just like giving giggs MOM yesterday. Surly the manager would talk tactically no?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-09 21:33:56	@bloodygoodrep @themichaelowen if Carrol goes to euro 2012 it will be as an option off the bench, lumping balls up front as a last option
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-09 21:41:46	@bloodygoodrep @themichaelowen I would allow rest yes. Don't European games offer a higher standard of knockout football?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-10 16:00:21	Pollard is the best catcher in world cricket!!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-11 12:05:46	@OliverKayTimes perceived underachievement comes from redknapp, he stated in jan with one or two additions we'd win the league. He left...
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-11 12:06:55	@OliverKayTimes ...himself open to the flack he's getting. Truth is as much as players, hecdiesnt know 'how' to win a championship
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-12 21:42:41	@bloodygoodrep wonder if @themichaelowen would like to see jan molby at northop hall cricket club in July with us, on the doorstep!!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-12 22:11:05	@bloodygoodrep I'm sure we could even sort out a lift for @themichaelowen I'd needed
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-23 18:48:37	@bloodygoodrep @swissramble I have just read the article about Liverpool. Very interesting. Good enough for @Marcotti good enough for me
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-23 21:11:53	@bloodygoodrep yes mate I am watching. Looking forward to it actually
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-23 21:15:47	@themichaelowen what did you think of Kevin Phillips on @talkSPORT ? He slammed lack of youth coming thru BCFC, honest or unprofessional?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-17 21:35:10	@bloodygoodrep were you watching me? Or have we just unwittingly done the same training session? I was running at #northophallcc
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-21 09:08:53	@OliverKayTimes all these things matter to clubs/fans because our teams are based on passion/com'ment/desire. Abroad it's based on skill...
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-21 09:09:44	@OliverKayTimes technique etc which means anyone can play for anyone as long as they're good. No history/loyalty needed, just ability
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-21 10:04:18	@bloodygoodrep are you going to town tonight after the races?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-22 12:04:28	Alonso that is the best F1 start I've ever seen!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-22 18:53:20	@VaughanCricket haha, cannot believe he didn't get it from schofields clues!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-18 14:29:33	Great article on #villas-boas by matt hughes in times today! Future of worlds leading football mangers. Where will he be in sept @Marcotti ?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-10 07:23:29	@natasiamoore just walked passed station, nothing going on
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-10 07:26:20	@bloodygoodrep think lpool making a point about investing in English youth, utd just buying players.
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-10 09:01:42	@natasiamoore oh dear! Jumped or pushed?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-10 09:17:27	@natasiamoore the doc on BBC1 from what I saw last night was brilliant! He hammered Fiona Bruce
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-12 19:51:08	@bloodygoodrep @pauldalglish @tonybarrettimes the other countries play to represent their characteristics, germans youthful and efficient
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-12 22:20:06	@bloodygoodrep @themichaelowen we have to stick together in our local community!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-23 21:18:37	@OliverKayTimes remarkable or acknowledgment that it's truly not a level playing field? In which case £4£ holloway/Martinez/Coyle?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-14 14:19:55	@LiamJPFlynn you getting used to twitter? See you're following more people
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-15 12:59:14	@honshu8 yeah think he is, I'm certainly game to bring him down. I'll speak to him and get back to you
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-15 21:44:43	@bloodygoodrep shocking mate, ukraine were the better team, more comfortable on ball. JH very poor on ball but not alone
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-16 09:21:33	@Joey7Barton good interview. Nice to hear someone talk openly
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-26 21:14:00	@OliverKayTimes @joey7barton one of the problems with FA is players like JB aren't allowed an opinion! Double standards
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-04 21:52:19	Only watching highlights but @jack_wilshere looked like the driving force of team. Carried by a teenager! Build the team around him!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-16 21:54:20	@bloodygoodrep agree with all you said, thing is we know tactics can inhibit good players, we just don't know if JH is a good player and ...
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-19 19:45:44	@achrisevans grip it and rip it! The way  forward!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-19 21:43:04	@LiamJPFlynn @fizzer18 well said, FA coaching courses are schemes to make money not help kids. Brooking begs for more money, burton project?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-19 21:50:50	@johntheleopard @joey7barton in reality we are slating system/clubs/FA. Players end product but needs changing surely? So poor technically
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-20 14:49:25	@piersmorgan so it's a completely staged melodrama of an interview just like the others!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-08 21:21:43	@honshu8 there's a link on the @realmadrid twitter regarding Doha C of E. May be worth some research, money no object there!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-09 19:18:23	Great points about managers and 'big names' as usual @Marcotti. Personally Martinez will be great, not yet, you?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-12 20:01:45	@bloodygoodrep @pauldalglish @tonybarrettimes barca only signed 'gifted' players regardless of physical attributes
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-12 20:15:51	@bloodygoodrep good, tiago is amazing though! Difference in ability is startling
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-12 21:38:53	@bloodygoodrep @barneystuta @talkofthekop I had to watch in pub. Worth going down though
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-12 21:50:07	@bloodygoodrep @themichaelowen generally agree with his tweets but way off the mark there
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-12 22:02:37	@bloodygoodrep heard it was awesome, watched to 25laps. Awesome coverage/racing this season!!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-22 18:15:48	Amazingly @MayorOfLondon is the most sensible speaking person on TV! Top points on Greece!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-22 21:49:33	@Marcotti where do you see Sanchez playing of he went to barca? Seems s dribbled rather than barca philosophy of pass, more suited to prem?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-29 00:16:19	@johntheleopard ridiculous mate. He's on another dimension. Shall we try it in pre season? Can't be that hard!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-30 09:29:31	@VaughanCricket that one person must be lost!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-30 10:20:54	Harry redknapp, how to beat barca, balls in the box and have a go! Next England manager? God help us
213677875	dannolan84	2011-05-21 20:50:17	@themichaelowen anchalotti for his dignity, David silva for his first touch. Gone unnoticed at times this year but he's quality!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-24 23:00:47	@bloodygoodrep @johntheleopard believe it's really anathemas up since we all left though that mobile is a decade old
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-15 08:16:31	@honshu8 sepp blatter will be pleased
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-15 20:50:14	@LiamJPFlynn been watching the u21's, it was awful! What's this weeks theme?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-04 20:00:09	@piersmorgan @charlizeafrica she came across brilliantly, your flirting did not...
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-16 16:49:05	@Marcotti is it me or would eto'o be the final piece in the man city puzzle if tevez goes. Would best fit their style of play too
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-16 21:55:30	@bloodygoodrep all signs are pointing towards him bring technically poor. Poor decision making can be taught but doesn't have a natural...
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-16 21:56:28	@bloodygoodrep flare and his concentration isn't there yet. Can't see where he will play?!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-20 14:31:37	@johnnystopwatch sounds good! You'll get into the swing, saw @liamjpflynn have a dart at neville or Barton last night! Quality
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-03 19:43:03	@honshu8 what's the tie break score mate?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-05 15:41:01	@fizzer18 any chance you can give us amateurs a general idea what exercises you do each day during pre season so we can copy?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-05 21:04:37	@bloodygoodrep @barneystuta good article for the most part. Not sure about teaching creativity but general philosophy sound.
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-09 12:28:42	@OliverKayTimes great article, makes me worried though if these are the thought processes of people running OUR clubs?! Would £20m not be...
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-09 12:30:19	@OliverKayTimes ..better spent on young English talent in their own academies? May get 1 or 2 players a season then, thoughts?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-09 16:26:46	Dave whelan on @talkSPORT  before. Best chairman in PL by a distance. Should be used to help sort FA out. Honest too!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-09 20:32:17	Phil the Greek is giving Fiona Bruce a torrid time on BBC1!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-09 21:44:21	@bloodygoodrep it's an awful lot for a boy who has no real experience and I'm "guessing" won't get much better?!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-09 21:59:41	@bloodygoodrep just perhaps 20m spent on academy would yield more potential than Henderson alone
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-06 18:58:30	@johnnystopwatch that's the only thing twitter is missing! Yes! Highlighters please
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-06 21:36:55	Thank the lord Jesus Christ melody has been fired! Though strangely I liked her on the after show with Dara
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-06 21:37:22	@johnnystopwatch I'd use both of them! Can't believe pam swears?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-06 21:57:52	@bloodygoodrep yes her too
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-12 14:03:01	@fizzer18 wish all pro's took their job so seriously and with such pride. #exampletoyoungsters
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-12 20:15:10	@OliverKayTimes he doesn't look like a footballer never mind midfielder!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-12 20:32:23	@bloodygoodrep 18 of 25 to defenders and GK. He was shit
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-12 20:48:32	@bloodygoodrep yeah I agree
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-12 21:39:43	@themichaelowen what evidence? We were totally outplayed tonight. Draw papers over so many cracks!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-12 21:49:33	@bloodygoodrep I went to see Liam Flynn as he was back from Manchester and having a pint with his dad, sorry mate never thought
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-12 22:01:48	@bloodygoodrep @themichaelowen just a blip hopefully! Yeah course he does. Jan molby+northop hall cc= winner surely?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-12 22:09:30	@bloodygoodrep @themichaelowen he's such a good guy surely a little confirmation tweet will come our way?!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-07 11:15:09	Betty just started office debate, biscuits or crisps?! It's an absolute hoot in here today
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-07 13:53:06	@karlsentk due to relative standard of national leagues/players or fatigue as they all play in europe?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-07 14:43:03	@karlsentk @mikeycavana would holding a mid season tournament like African cup of nations improve standard/interest?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-21 20:45:43	@McIlroyRory good job you don't want to drop the cup off the front of the bus!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-15 20:53:04	@jack_wilshere come on jack, we all know mancienne is just dreadful. Good decision not going, waste of your time playing with this shambles
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-15 21:06:48	@LiamJPFlynn worse if anything, mancienne/Henderson awful. We are lightyears behind other countries
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-16 10:47:20	@Schofe good point on the frape issue. Agree great cause going about it wrong way, especially with her last comment! She blew it
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-11 14:52:19	@Marcotti last 3 seasons in Aussie rules top spending team on sports science has won championship, EPL teams currently recruiting interns...
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-11 14:54:18	@Marcotti 'jobs' advertised on unsport website. Not headhunting elite. A token gesture highlighting why we are so behind. No Milan labs here
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-23 10:52:08	So @lord_sugar gets 11.4% roughly of total available people watching and @piersmorgan gets 5.9%, only one winner!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-24 22:32:04	@bloodygoodrep @johntheleopard my god, what a lucky lad! Why? Text speak making Catholicism hip, only in the gwyn!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-26 22:48:08	Fair play beyonce wasn't half bad!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-12 20:14:05	@Lord_Sugar when you questioned Helen why she didn't gave a business already, think she could have a successful company already but with...
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-12 20:15:32	@Lord_Sugar you on board she could have a massive company. Unless Tom invents something, don't think the others could say the same
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-12 20:59:09	@nlevett looking to in depth into it, should start by truly rationalising levels and course leaders delivery, recently on L2 where my style
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-12 21:00:51	@nlevett of coaching(self correction, then if make mistake again then coach) was deemed to be 'not getting in and coaching.' also mentors...
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-12 21:02:48	@nlevett should be able to allow for this and different philosophies and not just teach FA text who don't really have one
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-12 21:05:18	@bloodygoodrep god knows. May start blogging as I'm an opinionated, moaning old grump!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-12 21:19:57	@nlevett I will check out the resource now, interested to see where the philosophy will take us (players and coaches). Thanks
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-12 21:31:41	@nlevett I read the news item on FA website, it told me they have a clear philosophy, it costs £30 for the pack to hear what it is?!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-12 21:45:34	@nlevett agree and not up to you do so! I guess you are just more accessible than most so you get the Q's. Perhaps serialise it on Internet?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-13 18:48:01	@chrislepkowski maybe the scepticism is directed towards the media who want stories true or otherwise. There is nothing to gain in it for us
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-13 20:03:22	The apprentice time! Boom
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-13 21:00:35	@bloodygoodrep @mikeparry28 @chrishughes79 already pumped up for Sunday final!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-14 15:55:43	@honshu8 surely @thefadotcom should be proud of this new philosophy they have decided upon and want to show everybody?Especially grassroots
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-20 10:49:03	@johnnystopwatch how was the sun set last week?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-21 21:19:34	@themichaelowen surely age has nothing to do win it. Technically/tactically superb and has charisma to boot!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-21 22:14:29	@bloodygoodrep @themichaelowen I'm
sure he wants to come?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-28 11:12:58	@karlsentk isn't that a shame though, English stigmatism overriding ability and knowledge! Our 'top' ex pro's won't even go lower divisions
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-29 20:27:56	@piersmorgan @lord_sugar my god what was that role play about?! Cringe
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-29 20:33:24	@bloodygoodrep @piersmorgan @lord_sugar don't mcvities do a sharing biscuit?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-29 20:34:50	@bloodygoodrep @piersmorgan @lord_sugar go big or go home...it gets  worse!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-29 20:40:58	Helen just dominates
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-29 20:49:24	@bloodygoodrep sharing got zippo. Love Helen she's actually normal! Get them this weekend mate!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-29 20:50:19	@bloodygoodrep sorry yeah go big or go home did get 800k! Prove product is king
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-29 20:55:59	@bloodygoodrep melody does my pip in massively
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-29 21:47:16	@daraobriain think it makes a great change someone wants to be judged on ability and not a sob story, good luck to her
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-30 22:08:46	@bloodygoodrep @themichaelowen liked the fact he clarified it as a job not just playing for your team, often overlooked. Interesting bloke
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-30 22:11:01	@piersmorgan @themichaelowen editor until the end, typically paraphrasing to suit your argument instead of quoting the truth
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-22 20:21:57	@Lord_Sugar please tell me melody gets the bullet this week, she's impossible to watch without my BP rising!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-22 22:04:12	@bloodygoodrep hello mate, how's your week going? You see @MayorOfLondon playing ping pong on the one show. Top entertainment
213677875	dannolan84	2011-06-24 18:52:30	@natasiamoore what's the score?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-17 20:50:38	@Lord_Sugar the whole of the civil service have to take a desk/chair check, toms idea may work?!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-17 21:17:10	Maybe Jim should be a premier league manager with all his phrases and cliches! Steve Bruce style
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-01 07:32:27	@piersmorgan @themichaelowen you realise to be onhis show you need to be able to cry on cue!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-01 08:47:21	@johnnystopwatch you can't get it caught in buttons that's why!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-01 14:10:17	@johnnystopwatch it's ok, you've nothing to hide!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-02 08:20:21	@bloodygoodrep no mate, Leigh away
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-02 22:48:09	I didn't beat the big Ukrainian world champ because I had a poorly toe?! I don't think so david.
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-11 15:43:36	@henrywinter how has he justified a new contract and potentially getting GB role? Did the FA not watch euro U21's?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-12 22:02:05	@nlevett thanks for your time!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-13 20:25:11	@bloodygoodrep @mikeparry28 @chrishughes79 she could struggle. Like the pies
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-13 20:37:09	@bloodygoodrep @mikeparry28 @chrishughes79 never seen a pie dominate so much
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-13 20:56:49	@bloodygoodrep @chrishughes79 @mikeparry28 time she went!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-13 21:02:26	@natasiamoore strange quote in paper today, people talking about @McIlroyRory how good etc, Barry mcguigan "didn't realise he was catholic"
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-17 20:02:11	Come on Helen!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-17 21:00:51	@LiamJPFlynn she buffered it up didn't she. Kind of pleased for Tom, nice guy finally wins
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-13 20:42:11	And the pies take it!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-13 20:53:16	@bloodygoodrep @joey7barton Natasha digging a hole here!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-13 21:25:28	@Joey7Barton is passion an overused word in business and football, used to cover up lack of ability and knowledge or is it integral?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-17 21:33:37	Best entrance ever Tom!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-15 12:52:29	@RogerDavies1975 level 2 guidance is  3, no touch, one touch and multi touch
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-15 12:54:36	@RogerDavies1975 sorry misread tweet
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-18 12:25:29	“@OliverKayTimes: Manchester City release details of plans for "Etihad Campus". Impressive stuff #MCFC http://t.co/mY0GnsW” @honshu8
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-18 19:18:27	@Marcotti dispatches how to buy a football club channel 4, this could get messy!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-27 15:01:57	@johnnystopwatch it just keeps getting better! Shame I've just bought a new shower curtain!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-27 15:10:20	@bloodygoodrep yes mate definitely worth a chat
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-27 16:16:40	Can someone please tell les Ferdinand @SeedorfOfficial didn't play behind strikers at WHL in CL last season, it was at base of midfiield!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-11 14:31:28	@bloodygoodrep damn right I am!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-11 15:29:33	@bloodygoodrep bored cocks tweet in work. No they don't, it's number of innings of a score of 100+
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-12 23:08:40	@Williamson_95 yes mate I'll be there to catch up with you. Hopefully good news
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-24 20:49:31	With @GarethSouthgate working on English grass roots/youth football should he be saying arsenal should spend big?!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-25 21:57:17	@Williamson_95 how'd you go today mate?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-25 22:15:14	@Williamson_95 well done. Considering your year you've done well mate
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-25 22:21:04	@Williamson_95 a B is a good mark, allow you to do BTEC or a-level. Any games coming up?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-26 11:40:28	@JackWilshere ones a winger, the other a midfielder. Gervinho hasn't replaced you
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-31 17:08:28	@piersmorgan thought you wanted strikers and defenders the other day #makeyourmindup
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-31 19:21:44	@natasiamoore me and John were saying this before. Bassong not even bothering for QPR move...what a joke
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-31 21:24:04	@natasiamoore dependent on country. Ac Milan takes days and very detailed and uk one is a basic medical you'd have for any job....
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-31 21:24:45	@natasiamoore no idea o spurs wildcard. Huge punt someone like van bommal from Milan?!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-31 21:37:20	SWP"I've been waiting and chilling and driving and stopping really" sounds like a good day! What a wally
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-31 21:43:38	@bloodygoodrep big fan. Would have him at spurs. Would fit in well at chelsea (or arsenal) at top of midfield
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-31 21:48:05	You proud of the lovely arsenal fans on SSN now @piersmorgan ?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-31 21:49:04	@bloodygoodrep got no chance there.
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-31 21:56:39	@johntheleopard what a plonker he is!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-31 22:14:43	@OliverKayTimes might just be the best bit of #deadlineday business by Chelsea! Fits AVB fluid approach to attacking
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-14 12:04:06	New man crush Andre villas boas!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-01 18:54:34	@GarethSouthgate one stap shot from long rage constitutes decent half. Did we use ball well? Technically/tactically good?Creative/efficient?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-07-31 20:24:45	@Joey7Barton check out the end of tonights top gear, shows how good we really have it. #humbled
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-14 21:54:11	@piersmorgan can you actually name one? All very well you need that type of player and you have money but say a realistic name?!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-15 09:18:31	@bloodygoodrep hey mate I did watch it, great game, Real much the better team!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-01 19:09:21	@natasiamoore get a Yorkshire cup of tea you. That's what a proper drinker uses
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-01 19:11:34	@bloodygoodrep @garethsouthgate so what are we looking to develop in our u19's? Genuine question, not sarcastic
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-01 19:13:23	http://t.co/bsrYhDH @bloodygoodrep check this out. Decent article and what I've been saying. Next England manager?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-01 19:14:02	@thedannyhayes @natasiamoore couldn't agree more!!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-01 19:14:49	@natasiamoore yes definitely but only before 8pm or I won't sleep
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-01 19:15:07	@bloodygoodrep yes mate, really need to
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-01 19:19:05	@natasiamoore @johntheleopard @zoeshaughnessy he gave me tetley yesterday and said it was bad before serving! Unbelievable!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-01 19:47:09	@bloodygoodrep @zoeshaughnessy @natasiamoore 1 tweet doesn't make it better, cool cats like tea!!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-01 20:13:33	@GarethSouthgate wouldn't that be lack of depth? U19's playing up an age group?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-01 20:33:44	@kevinpp24 @fizzer18 and that he's ready to attack the day!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-02 21:55:05	@NutritionWales Dan Nolan. Multi sports player. Interest in health, fitness, all sports, rehab/prehab. Interested in working in area
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-03 08:15:11	How do you send the private messages? #confused
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-03 08:41:06	@bloodygoodrep all sorted thanks mate. That @NutritionWales opportunity might be worth serious investigation
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-01 15:53:35	@VaughanCricket England able to apply pressure in all conditions with variety in attack and work done by management. #professionalism
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-01 15:59:20	@Joey7Barton surely an opportunity to get a club where you can achieve vast potential and prove to yourself and others you are 'that good'
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-01 21:21:04	@henrywinter good point but it's also how you teach them on and off ball and technique, number of players is just a side issue..philosophy!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-17 11:54:08	@Joey7Barton interesting article by Matthew syed in the times featuring you, what do you think?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-17 14:51:17	@johnnystopwatch I really think they've made strides in the prize stakes! One day soon it'll be something useful!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-17 14:52:22	@bloodygoodrep you could be right, watch it in bed with one eye open and still trying to analyse tactics
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-17 19:33:39	@bloodygoodrep well worth taking the to do a few. Maybe even some light functional stuff too. I need to, supple as a twiglet currently!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-17 20:58:41	Just settling down to watch el Classico second leg, #xavi starts..enough said
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-17 21:22:05	20 minutes gone, 1-1 and it's that quick I'm exhausted watching...amazing stuff
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-19 08:08:15	@Williamson_95 hi mate really sorry but you ok to come with us tomorrow?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-19 12:01:28	@Williamson_95 much appreciated mate, know it's a pain for you. I'll pick you up 9.40
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-05 20:29:33	@Joey7Barton what was Ganso like? Supposed to be the next big thing
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-06 16:41:01	@OliverKayTimes scholes as good but on his own, xavi/iniesta great alone, but maybe best midfield ever together
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-21 12:54:21	@PROSCORE @bloodygoodrep I will check site out today and get a cv across you you asap. Be good to speak to you
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-21 13:10:40	@bloodygoodrep I have to say I haven't yet but I will
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-21 15:32:06	Have to say city are excellent, especially silva and dzeko
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-04 19:17:37	@themichaelowen you have mentioned about 15 championship clubs now for promotion! Not really stuck your rep on the line there Michael!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-22 19:25:29	Sell modric and build team around kranjaer! He's a better footballer
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-22 21:32:59	@bloodygoodrep saw most of it, utd better second half but city best team in the first two games!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-06 20:57:09	@bloodygoodrep I would have used the word abject
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-06 20:59:13	@rioferdy5 bigger issue! We will qualify with average performances but will never win a champ's with the amount of average performances2010!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-06 21:04:58	@bloodygoodrep not sure if greedy or poor decision maker. It's not like he practices at his club
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-06 21:11:10	@bloodygoodrep I don't think he has another facet to his game. One directional with little skill, easy for good defenders
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-06 21:22:06	@bloodygoodrep definitely. However you could label that to the majority of people
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-07 15:09:20	@johnnystopwatch planning ahead by the powers at be! Bingo hit by austerity drive!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-06 20:30:29	@honshu8 @themichaelowen totally agree. I bet they were cringing as they watched the U21 champ's unravel
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-23 21:46:42	@Williamson_95 how'd you get on tonight?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-23 22:00:27	@Joey7Barton follow football speak on here and you can also blog on their website.
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-23 22:04:57	@Williamson_95 nightmare. Keep your chin up kid
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-07 20:40:18	@Lord_Sugar @piersmorgan @nectarbusiness how did Zuckerburg not win?!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-25 22:27:25	@Williamson_95 well I hope you get back playing soon buddy
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-08 21:14:12	New low for 'great' Britain!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-28 00:11:25	@honshu8 top day, top couple, top wedding. Definitely worth the long day tomo. Plus big Brian told his don't take off your jacket story!

213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-11 13:29:40	@VaughanCricket bad idea with your knees!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-11 17:13:02	@henrywinter poor positioning and not great concentration lead to poor decision making. No real quality in no.2 position if we are honest
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-11 20:53:26	@raymondverheije where else will you be working? Anything in the north west and could any outsiders come to learn from you?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-11 20:54:29	@Marcotti unless you're barca and throw midfielders everywhere.
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-12 20:02:54	@rioferdy5 two game ban like @WayneRooney? Fairs fair!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-13 14:38:58	@OliverKayTimes just read the Tom dart article with bits from torres' interview. What's the big deal? He's only mentioning style of play
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-13 15:52:59	Does anybody have a spare left calf? I seem to have lost mine
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-13 21:03:40	@44robbo44 me and @bloodygoodrep went middle distance athletics last night. Running round the bend has killed me
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-09 20:47:14	Capello got ripped to shreds for that index link pre WC '10. H Redknapp is promoting sky fantasy footy naming oppo players, any difference?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-09 21:21:58	@Joey7Barton has inception of PL and the copying of NFL developed a cash cow that is more about profits than a breeding ground for talent?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-09 21:23:29	@bloodygoodrep Harry is face of new sky fantasy footy thing. "play yaya behind drogba" and so on...capello got rodded for doing player index
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-09 21:40:36	@bloodygoodrep my whole point! Everybody loves our Harry! Went well, lads liked it and worked hard...I enjoyed taking it too
213677875	dannolan84	2011-08-09 21:51:44	@bloodygoodrep gets away with murder because he's 'one of us.' had some positive feedback off lads which is good

213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-15 18:56:25	@GarethSouthgate rugby can easily turn into grappling but footballers have to make a considered change! Rugby=sir football=f**king pr!ck
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-17 16:38:36	@jamie7reed good result mate! Nice to see you're on the scoresheet and starting
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-20 12:00:54	Harry redknapp is an idiot. I wanted to keep Palacios and woodgate but they kept getting injured, get individual training programmes then!!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-20 12:42:20	@dylofff this is easily my favourite moment from Saturday night  http://t.co/I3L2wQ9r

213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-20 19:23:08	Valencia miss worse than Torres? Maybe. Will he get as much stick? Definitely not
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-20 21:27:40	@johnnystopwatch we should catch up later this week mate when you're free
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-20 21:31:51	So who's fault is it today Harry? Ref? Players we couldn't attract? Players we couldn't keep because of insurance? Or maybe just maybe you?!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-21 07:49:16	@johnnystopwatch my boat could be floated by it yes
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-21 07:50:38	@bloodygoodrep #don'tworryladiesit'sjustmyniece! Ps, HR is turning into a joke.
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-21 09:18:10	@bloodygoodrep yes of course
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-22 12:05:38	@johnnystopwatch what's going on in Georgia?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-22 17:01:31	@bloodygoodrep @johnnystopwatch oh I actually heard about that just realise where it happened. Ludacrious
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-22 17:09:26	@Williamson_95 how's Rhyl going?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-22 17:29:14	@johnnystopwatch @bloodygoodrep said on radio they had another man who's admitting doing it!! Odd
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-22 17:50:06	@JenChang88 think problem is the difference between best and worse players in MLS is too great. Easier to be dragged down than drag up
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-23 13:11:28	@honshu8 follow @raymondverheije decent background and interesting

213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-27 11:58:38	@raymondverheije interested to hear he complained of constant jabs. Any idea what they were? Think back too, when they had no defenders!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-10-05 08:40:54	@nlevett I recommend reading the Matthew syed article in yesterdays the times. True self evaluation, great piece!

213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-29 20:43:30	@raymondverheije totally agree. EPL exciting due to constant turnover of possession and physicality. Lack of skill or thought too often tho
213677875	dannolan84	2011-09-29 20:44:39	@honshu8 sure we will talk about it tomorrow in more detail

213677875	dannolan84	2011-10-16 19:53:57	@henrywinter it's the constant turnover of possession which seems to be part and parcel of PL which worries me. Euro's will highlight fact
213677875	dannolan84	2011-10-13 16:07:48	@raymondverheije could you get them to question spurs growing injury list and lack of personal S&C programmes?!

213677875	dannolan84	2011-10-28 20:55:02	@JenChang88 agree. He would be a huge buy for AFC, allow others to play with cover behind. Gago also do same job

213677875	dannolan84	2011-11-11 12:54:39	@GuillemBalague would have been more interesting for him to say how to stop Spain rather than listing strengths we already know

213677875	dannolan84	2011-11-14 09:38:47	@JamesHorncastle surely Ancelotti is a dead cert for Spurs job. Stayed in London, wants EPL job, with HR next England manager or in jail
213677875	dannolan84	2011-11-27 01:44:35	@ChristianMcr @guillembalague Stoke would struggle at Getafe though too. Great league playing the game properly!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-11-30 14:04:34	@Marcotti @henrywinter why do Harry Redknapps comments about Anelka made today not count as tapping up? Others would surely be questioned
213677875	dannolan84	2011-11-30 14:35:12	@henrywinter good point, although not in that final 6 month period. Also happened with Tevez.
213677875	dannolan84	2011-12-10 09:38:48	@johntheleopard @quinty1984 ha. Maybe mate. He'll be a grumpy bugger this morning though!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-12-12 22:46:38	@OliverKayTimes agree after tactical change. Will your piece tomorrow hail AVB for change so early?

213677875	dannolan84	2011-12-09 09:02:31	@Marcotti @goonernl great blog. Agree  totally! Wonder what @GarethSouthgate and @nlevett think?
213677875	dannolan84	2011-12-09 10:13:16	@honshu8 only thing he hadn't mentioned was having to pay for the FA philosophy

213677875	dannolan84	2011-12-09 13:52:54	@nlevett @goonernl as though a lot of what FA talk about re more and better coaching seems like spin. Only time will tell
213677875	dannolan84	2011-12-10 09:25:02	@johntheleopard @quinty1984 what a party animal our lad has become again!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-11-25 10:51:01	@honshu8 very good read. We've mentioned before greater reserve/U21 games and regional teams. Don't think he rates FA course either
213677875	dannolan84	2011-11-25 11:09:22	@honshu8 I can't sadly either. Regional feeder academies are the way forward like France/spain. Great achievement
213677875	dannolan84	2011-11-25 12:42:41	@ghostgoal great piece on Franco Baresi.

213677875	dannolan84	2011-12-20 17:21:01	@pbarclaytimes clattenburg damn good? David Silva penalty not given against Chelsea? Not a great decision in big game!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-12-10 09:27:48	@OliverKayTimes agree re Neville specifically but overall AVB tenure so far has been over scrutinised. His biggest issue is JT too. He is...

213677875	dannolan84	2011-12-10 09:30:17	@OliverKayTimes he would get hammered by media regardless of it being correct or not. That's what's holding them back

213677875	dannolan84	2011-12-22 21:18:21	Romeu out of all the players in this game is the best tactically and technically by far!
213677875	dannolan84	2011-12-22 22:10:57	In a very unique style mark cavendish made more interesting points in one minute than most journalists do in a dozen articles
213677875	dannolan84	2011-12-22 22:14:47	@Williamson_95 agree. He is exceptional though. Amazing when he came on Chelsea played ball from the back much better
213677875	dannolan84	2011-12-22 22:30:23	@Williamson_95 it was alarming last year when Guariola was asked about @jack_wilshere, he said we have 5 in the reserves! Romeu obv one
213677875	dannolan84	2011-12-22 22:44:33	@Williamson_95 best 2 leagues for promoting young homegrown players, most entertaining for purists too! DFB also exceptionally well run!

213677875	dannolan84	2012-01-13 20:44:08	@themichaelowen remember to 'get in and coach' Michael! And the 4 corners! The FA love all that nonsense
213677875	dannolan84	2012-01-13 21:52:00	@themichaelowen 2 v 1 in box with a small goal in corner to protect. Body shape, using touchline as extra defender. SSG use a floater 9 v 8
213677875	dannolan84	2012-01-13 21:53:11	@themichaelowen to whoever is in possession. Also make a point of angle of approach forces players into areas that help defender
213677875	dannolan84	2012-01-13 21:58:29	@themichaelowen don't tow the party line, it's an average course. Could you imagine the Spanish FA saying spread out as a technical point?

213677875	dannolan84	2012-01-11 21:27:46	@VincentKompany don't necessarily agree 100% with views but your tackle not a red card IMO. However it was an eloquently put statement

213677875	dannolan84	2012-01-16 19:43:45	@GNev2 great analysis on Swansea, Rogers a great coach and manager. Is it as simple as more time spent on training ground than others?

213677875	dannolan84	2012-01-26 20:39:13	@nlevett @rogerdavies1975 don't get confused with expression and development in sport and specific methodology in learning.
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-02 18:33:23	@Marcotti Napoli would have to go through decisions against too for Amy relevance surely? And still a tad childish
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-02 20:07:50	@Joey7Barton #54dinner :Muhammad Ali, Matthew Syed, Churchill, Jose Mourinho, @stephenfry ...funny old mix!!
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-02 21:59:56	@jwtoon9 @joey7barton no point with madela, in invictus he's always 'working a little'. Never join in the conversation!
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-02 22:20:08	@jwtoon9 @joey7barton I went Churchill! But Matthew Syed is both sport and politics so he can bring everyone together. He's good
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-02 22:22:04	@RorySmithTimes @gcardosolopes we coil have next electoral vote by trending on twitter?!

213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-02 22:37:14	@jwtoon9 @joey7barton just want to see how much champers Churchill could actually swig!
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-02 22:39:20	@david__bentley it's all about the dude who's 6' 8" (and a half) tonight... #newluther
213677875	dannolan84	2012-01-26 22:24:18	Redknapps defence is pathetic. How does he write a The Sun column if he's illiterate? Also the oxford utd £250k, FA due diligence new owner?
213677875	dannolan84	2012-01-26 22:27:10	Do we really want this man running the england team? Never send a email/text/letter? He just gets more pathetic
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-03 10:59:56	@honshu8 is that @fizzer18 blog? Not read it yet, do you have a link or just go on site?
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-03 11:55:23	@honshu8 good read. Amazing how much they take on really! Yep no carb's reads like that article. Sounds like a nice lifestyle. @fizzer18 pro

213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-05 08:30:22	@byauss1 thanks for replying. Some interesting areas to look at
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-05 08:37:30	@GNev2 @henrywinter captaincy only important as we have nothing else of note to focus on, like style of play, tactics or trophies.means nout
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-05 08:40:25	@fizzer18 @henrywinter maybe it's still important to media, bigger target for them? More pressure on captain, more to loose.
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-05 08:45:02	@fizzer18 @vaughancricket @gnev2 great manager. Players not capable of carrying out instructions. WC we played formation used at Milan with
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-05 08:46:30	@fizzer18 @vaughancricket @gnev2 Rooney/gerrard in link. Both lost patience and drifted infield/deep, got separated, couldn't link.
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-05 09:42:32	@fizzer18 @vaughancricket @gnev2 just what we need, a tax dodger who can't read or write in charge!!
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-05 09:48:26	@SundaySupp are we really that bothered what our captain wears to a press conf? Would be nice to have some good, intelligent, decent players
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-05 10:23:41	@sundaysupp  this whole Villas Boas talk is rude, mis placed and lazy journalism. Why is a guy who is young, naive? Oh and he has won stuff
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-05 15:36:44	What the he'll is Fergie wearing? #shocker

213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-05 17:20:40	Pen was AVB's fault...good one Geoff
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-05 22:59:12	@piersmorgan you should read @Marcotti timeline, he explains it, or just keep slamming him relentlessly, old habits die hard
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-05 23:01:39	@paddybarclay David Luiz is suddenly a better player, reason being he hasn't got the robotic Terry next to him.
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-11 23:39:01	@LiamJPFlynn time flys when you're having fun mate. Things are exactly the same as when you left mate! Looking forward to catching up

213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-14 19:49:27	@TacticianMagDan would like to see without alexis, eliminate the longer ball, force them back to previous style of only short passes 1/2
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-14 19:50:22	@TacticianMagDan they would regain their fluency. Eg busquets would never ordinarily play that long ball 3rd min. He'd have retained ball
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-14 20:01:48	@tacticianmagdan also cesc playing in CM 3 tonight but playing high still. Barca loosing cohesion in Last 3rdas he's flat on back 4.

213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-07 19:29:16	@nolanorroberts good luck with the journey more than the meeting I think!
213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-08 09:20:40	@henrywinter it would be interesting to hear your views if you were to be so hyper critical of enclaves players!!!

213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-08 12:13:12	@henrywinter  remember, like dalglish with LFC fans, you the media will basically appoint him and when it goes wrong you can't blame the FA

213677875	dannolan84	2012-02-08 22:16:38	@GlynnErnesto @ollieholtmirror @bloodygoodrep the fact that our team needs such structure and have an inability to act as pro's says it all

213677875	dannolan84	2012-03-06 23:26:48	@Marcotti he'll have to rule himself out of the England job with tactical awareness like that
213677875	dannolan84	2012-03-08 18:29:02	@honshu8 @sidlowe I think it may be the sheer volume of analysis that would hinder him. Just imagine telling JT how to kick a ball?!!!

213677875	dannolan84	2012-04-22 13:49:43	@JenChang88 it allows them to talk about something other than tactical awareness/technique etc.
213677875	dannolan84	2012-04-23 12:08:10	@JenChang88 uk press have made their bed, unfortunately the whole supporting nation has to lie in it
213677875	dannolan84	2012-04-23 13:45:40	@TonyEvansTimes @jenchang88 usually a reader of the times however I haven't today no. Personal opinion, media want him,too late to backtrack
213677875	dannolan84	2012-04-23 13:47:23	@LorenzoDelC @jenchang88 english press too interested in personality man man't skills, it's an easier story than to look at it analytically
213677875	dannolan84	2012-04-23 13:49:34	@Calum293 @jenchang88 sorry, English press you're right.

213677875	dannolan84	2012-04-24 12:12:39	@DickinsonTimes it's too easy to question mentality from outside as no one can really answer. Is he good? Yes, so pick him
213677875	dannolan84	2012-04-24 13:04:46	@Laligauk so he spends millions on other British 'talent' in stead of using the ones he already has. Thanks!

213677875	dannolan84	2012-04-26 18:28:08	@honshu8 @henrywinter I think it might be a waste of his time unfortunately. Rose amongst thorns
213677875	dannolan84	2012-05-01 11:58:50	@henrywinter why does he need to win players and media over? Players should follow instruction, media should report, no?
213677875	dannolan84	2012-05-04 12:02:52	@ChristianMcr also would love to see valero feeding calzorlo and higuain from that slightly deeper position he played until recently
213677875	dannolan84	2012-05-04 13:45:43	@ChristianMcr you not think if they get CL? Big money, big opportunity, play every week. Think he may be tempted
213677875	dannolan84	2012-05-04 14:40:16	@ChristianMcr good on them if that's the case. Long term development will work best in long run.

213677875	dannolan84	2012-05-06 14:24:33	@Zonal_Marking it allows them to change shape in other areas. Both full backs can go further forward with NDJ there too.

213677875	dannolan84	2012-05-19 19:54:30	Mikel slightly better than normal on the ball, even worse than normal off it. For all their skill on wide bayern should score from central

213677875	dannolan84	2012-05-25 21:17:54	@JohnSinnott @soccerquant it was Guardiola who developed most of them through B team and made others even better, moving Messi etc
213677875	dannolan84	2012-05-25 21:19:48	@johnsinnott @soccerquant also using different styles of pressing, loosing Henry/eto'o which was risky. Changed attitude of everyone
213677875	dannolan84	2012-05-25 21:22:02	@soccerquant @johnsinnott capable is ?able. Eg busquets slow, no real skill, doesn't dribble, limited range of passing but best def mid in..

213677875	dannolan84	2012-05-25 21:29:35	@soccerquant @johnsinnott understand why you might not agree but personally think he's the best. Him against Germany WC semi '10 faultless
