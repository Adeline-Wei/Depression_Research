214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-17 04:23:37	How do you review the call and still get it wrong?
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-18 18:46:38	Story of the jets right there. Reallistically, we can be considered one of the bottom 5 teams in the league
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-18 18:51:45	Cro said "hit the weight room lil bitcchhh"
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-18 19:08:35	‚Äú@nyjets: #RL Mark Sanchez so far is 7-for-10 for 79 yds, TD, 126.7 passer rating.‚Äù @JasonLaCanfora report that? Noo? Biased reporter
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-18 19:19:29	Welp knicks bouta be 7-1. Back to our winning ways
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-18 20:27:09	You know the jets didnt wanna lose to schotty. Exposin his predictable offense today.
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-18 20:27:41	Even tho jets one of the worst run defense teams in the league, schotty cant get stephen jackson rollin? Wtf?
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-18 20:29:02	Obviously that would happen lol
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-18 20:29:42	@DannyMacDonough haha just sayin some of what us jet fans talked about is being backed up. Everyone called us dumb for sayin that
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-18 20:31:09	@DannyMacDonough plus as a jet fan i cant dump on anybody
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-18 20:32:56	Wow is that texans game happenin?
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-18 20:33:46	I dont understand the 2pt there? Now two tds will only tie for rams instead of win
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-18 21:00:08	#Jets win #Knicks win. Good day

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-22 21:41:36	@DonnieMackHoops i know i was jus sayin that. They wanted that game to go on as long as possible
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-23 02:21:20	At least our offense gained yards. The defense is only giving up yards
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-23 02:34:01	What am i thankful for you ask? Its not the jets
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-23 02:34:46	I told yall a couple weeks ago its knicks season out here. Thats all i know bout
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-23 02:41:01	Put mcelroy at safety too

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-21 02:43:29	Leave it to a #knicks fan to be winning by 18 and still find something to complain about staring 9-1 in the face
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-21 03:18:21	Or 8-1. Whatever. Still doin work #knickstape
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-21 03:20:07	They say the knicks have played the toughest schedule in the nba so far. But we have the best record in the nba
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-23 01:18:34	Even tho the season is basically over. There is no greater feeling than beating the pats. Fuck yall #nyj

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-23 02:48:24	Ah yes. Good play call. Lets run it in the two minute warning down 35
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-23 03:05:31	Put mcelroy in if anything. Tebow will never win a superbowl as a qb and thats the ultimate goal
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-23 05:55:28	25 cents for a taco at taco bell maybe?

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-30 16:37:07	Why the fuck do they never listen to scooby about who the bad guy is? He is always right
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-30 16:58:05	Skip is arguing for manti te'o to get heisman. Stephen A wants johnny manziel
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-30 17:05:37	That last tweet was supposed to @Mezz_CAPO
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-30 17:18:18	After listening to skip right now i agree wit popovich even more than i did before. And stephen A arguin for both sides which hes right too
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-30 17:19:05	And the spurs are a lot better than i thought btw. How you not have your 4 best players and still take miami, in miami to the end
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-30 17:19:41	Especially when miami had 4 days off after a game vs cleveland and the spurs were on their 6th straight road game
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-30 17:21:12	Even if miami played down to the competition, which it seems like they did. Thats pretty impressive for spurs, usual bench, thurs starters
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-27 02:24:07	Me and @jordanbuford over here stressin bout them #knicks and this #kings game

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-23 02:37:39	Pats ran 3 offensive plays this quarter. 3 td. Not all on offense but 3 tds
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-11-27 05:15:24	Its been 10 monts already? Damn time flies. üíò @_nantyxo

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-05 16:18:12	1. They didnt give him options and they never had someone groom him. 2. They decided to give him extra money and now were stuck either way

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-02 20:47:57	Looks like we hafta bring joe girardi in again to teach mcelroy the slide lol
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-03 14:48:35	This gon be a longgg day
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-07 02:20:10	@SoBL3SSED1 how bout how fast that release is tho

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-07 04:05:15	Skip really dont know bball tho. Why you think the knicks got so many 3s against the heat twice?
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-03 18:22:10	@DannyMacDonough you gotta ask me again in a couple days when im used to it. Im not taking this too well. Its upsetting to me
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-07 00:38:57	#knickstape we took round 1 by 20. How much we win by when melo got 5 stitches in his hand? Cant be 20 wit our best player hurt. Wut bout 9?
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-07 00:47:05	This gon be a good one. Watchin it wit two heat fans tho haha bum ass @DonnieMackHoops and bum ass @TheeGrownSimba lmao
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-07 01:04:57	Dammit. No melo. Whos startin for him?

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-08 02:48:09	@giaclem i wish that could be a retweet
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-08 03:58:27	Kid cudi
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-07 01:45:53	And thats without our 28 points a game star
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-07 02:28:06	@SoBL3SSED1 i just dont like how their defense has dropped significantly. They always hung their hat on D. Top 3 D and now they 21
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-07 02:40:28	Thru 1 hal we tied lacking our best player
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-05 04:22:30	Whoever invented spin the bottle must have been super persuasive cause thats a pretty creepy thing to suggest at a party
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-05 04:22:54	Like "hey guys, wanna sit in a cicrle and make out?"
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-05 04:24:34	@JadeMa05 @mezz_capo percisely
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-06 01:59:24	Jr smith is 1/9 from 3. I think its time to stop buddy. Tns not ya night
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-06 02:07:47	Where melo at in the 2nd half?
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-06 02:18:08	How many times have we missed like 3 shots in one possession tn?
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-06 02:59:23	Charlotte.... Ya got... Tell iman @I_Am_Iman
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-09 19:23:27	So kerley schillens gilliard and reuland. Im pumped for the 2nd half. Jesus himself could quarterback this team and score no points #Jets
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-09 19:42:38	How do you watch bilal run and shonn run and not start bilal?
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-09 20:14:17	Ill say it again. Why doesnt bilal start?
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-09 20:47:14	Why is shonn running the ball?!?!
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-09 22:37:05	@mowilkerson great game mo
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-07 04:05:29	Cause the heat cant keep out guards in front of them
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-11 17:08:24	If thats not an upgraded more mature melo, idk what is http://t.co/C6RFiu70

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-11 21:51:11	@OfficialBraylon welcome back bray. Too bad we already lost two years
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-11 21:51:47	And like i said 2 years ago. We shoulda never let braylon go and now the jets have realized their mistake
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-14 01:20:58	Carmelo cookin already
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-14 01:36:28	@SoBL3SSED1 haha i got you. Its iman shumperts thing. He raps and calls it the #Knickstape so the whole team just started sayin it

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-11 21:59:13	@AmyOlmos lmao i feel like i was in a 4% of jet nation that always wanted braylon to be a jet for life
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-11 22:01:39	@AmyOlmos they were such a good pair a couple years ago
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-14 16:03:09	Just took my last final......... Ever

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-12 22:26:10	Its weird getting calls about music and being respected as a manager
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-13 00:47:22	The #nyj #jets followed me before the days of #jetnation500k
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-16 02:55:09	Kyrie makin this too close. He is filthy
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-16 18:50:08	Ive come to the conclusion that eli is only #elite for about 60% of the time. Too many mediocre moments
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-16 18:50:47	Which is why, to me, hes not among brady manning brees rodgers
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-17 00:11:07	@KidCorrect if cowboys win you know you not in the WC right?
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-17 01:20:18	Ok so giants basically gotta win the division to be in the playoffs at this points. Bears and vikings also ahead of them with tiebreakers
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-16 19:16:34	@jordanbuford he was elite in thise games but half the time he looks anything but elite

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-18 01:13:56	Who heard trent dilfer just now? Its what me and @Mezz_CAPO been sayin bout the sanchez situation and its proof the organization ruined him
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-18 01:14:21	He was never gonna succeed
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-18 01:15:01	The jets never helped him in any way and never invested in him. Its not gonna matter who we draft till we change that
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-18 05:10:41	@KidCorrect thank you
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-17 19:16:15	@Mezz_CAPO you just made my decision on where im goin for lunch

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-22 20:34:10	@Mezz_CAPO they might win but they are the biggest pussies ever lol
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-21 19:50:22	@Mezz_CAPO plus theres a point when the baggage outweighs the production
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 17:38:00	@Mezz_CAPO 0% i dont think theyll take him out. Were not playing for anything
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 18:06:06	Wait? So you mean to say the wrs dont get open for mcelroy either?
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 18:07:56	Thats weird
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 18:59:24	The chargers are poorly coached
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 05:00:54	@Griminal4Life haha its someone we played in high school football. A qb that beat us in the playoffs. You wouldnt know him
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 19:24:33	Wow. That throw was pretty poor. Where are the boos?
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 19:24:51	He was wide open
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 19:25:31	Sooooooo. Yeah
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 19:25:55	Jets fans are so dumb lol
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 19:26:41	Cant wait to get mcelroy in there. If not for greene going all over the field and kerley with a 42 yard pass we be the same as usual
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 19:27:09	Oh and another drop? Oh so sanchez wasnt catching the passes?
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 19:27:26	Next year we gotta do something drastic
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 19:29:21	I say trade revis. Cros playing like revis, imagine what we could get for him. Lets do a patriots move and pile up draft picks
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 19:29:49	Coples and wilkerson only getting better makin it easier on our corners anyway
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 19:30:44	We can be pretty dominant without revis. We played bad in the begining of the year but we 8th defense now
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 19:31:12	Then that clears up cap so we can resin laron landry
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 19:31:34	No more holdout headaches tht seem to come every year
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 19:32:18	Get picks and draft wrs and idk what to do at qb but i hope to god its not michael vick
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 20:21:56	Jets still cant cover tightends tho
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 20:30:59	And i rest my case
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 20:41:53	Thats why braylon should have always been a jet
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 20:47:26	@Mezz_CAPO mcelroy cant run the routes or block better than sanchez?
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 21:12:46	Check that 11
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 23:27:49	Webster is gettin torched. And oher has 3 penalties on the drive alone
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 23:30:10	Webster again. Someones gonna be looking for work this offseason
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 18:33:12	Mcelroy is about to wonder why the jets ever got rid of braylon
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 21:04:09	Sack fumble reminiscent of pats game
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-23 21:09:36	Mcelroy out here makin sanchez look decent haha. Sacked 10 times?!?!

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-27 05:35:41	religion is a crazy thing. i think its so amazing that so many ppl can believe in Jesus and believe all hes done and that hes a savior
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-27 05:36:46	ppl can come together and strengthen each other through religion. no matter what you believe its wild how powerful it is
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-27 05:37:08	i believe in God and tht he gave us this freedom and what a freedom that is
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-30 02:08:58	cant even describe how i feel
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-30 04:39:28	@_nantyxo thank you for always knowing exactly how to make me smile big
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-31 18:45:51	so, changes being made with the #jets ... when do talks with @Mezz_CAPO begin about how we will be the best team in the nfl next year??
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-31 18:46:25	our annual talks of how the jets will win the superbowl must be coming soon @Mezz_CAPO
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-30 21:49:59	i hope AP breaks dickersons record
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-30 21:54:57	@damienwoody i been sayin its time to rebuild. jets fans need patience which something we dont have
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-31 04:55:21	seahawks redskins game is gonna be sick. and interested to see how andrew luck performa against bmore in the playoffs
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-31 04:56:44	not taking anything away from luck but only 3 teams of the 11 they beat had winning records
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-31 04:57:23	luck is good qb tho, just dk if the colts have a good enough team
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-28 17:26:15	@jazzybelle1 what part?

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-28 18:54:20	@jazzybelle1 ik haha thats crazy
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-01 19:38:56	fellow jets fans http://t.co/kDJsO42s @Mezz_CAPO

214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-29 05:13:16	#knicks were down 27. came back without melo and without felton... uhh yeahh. #knickstape is for real
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-29 05:13:29	still gotta close this game tho
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-29 05:23:43	cant believe they came back from 27 down. to go up by 5. to lose by 1 haha. that sucks. melo and felton get well soon
214962262	DMassaro27	2012-12-31 17:26:09	serious changes already occurring, serious changes need to continue
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-01 23:03:59	amares first game back tn
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-03 22:42:49	the 6 afc playoff qbs this year have 51 playoff appearances with 31 wins. the 6 nfc qbs have 9 and 4 respectively. all 4 wins are rodgers
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-03 22:44:03	im guessing alot of those afc playoff wins and appearances would have to be peyton and brady
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-03 22:53:56	packers, ravens, bengals, skins
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-05 05:04:55	@xlisaveronicax whats the blake drinking game?

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-05 06:31:50	this is why i love kobe, kobe always competes even when its impossible to win. impossible isnt in kobes language
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-05 06:32:50	lebron had to wait till he was on the most talented team the aberave mind can remember
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-05 06:35:38	@C_Mezz26 lmao this is what ppl say when they know im right...... our real problem is to figure out is how to make the jets better

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-08 18:56:06	why the jets shouldnt get vick. over past two seasons sanchez avg turnovers/game 1.58 vicks is 1.34, sanchez completed 55.6% to vicks 59%...
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-17 22:53:21	@BMaldz thank you bianca!!

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-16 21:20:58	@DonnieMackHoops haha. how you likin cabrini?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-08 18:56:42	plus sanchez won more games while vick had better WRs and better RB not to mention andy reid is better offensive mind than all jets together
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-08 18:56:54	not saying sanchez is good. just saying that vick is bad
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-08 18:58:45	plus vick fails to stay healthy year after year. he started all 16 games only once in his entire career
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-16 21:47:41	@TheeGrownSimba no doubt
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-16 23:09:40	@DonnieMackHoops i feel you. trust, its different not goin to school at all haha

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-17 02:10:33	it sucks that the jets cant even pay someone to work for them. one candidate pay would more than triple if took the job but turned it down
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-17 02:11:24	one day the nightmare of the jets will be over. one day in my lifetime
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-17 02:11:57	doesnt even feel like my birthday

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-21 02:55:56	if lee evans didnt drop a touchdown and the 9ers punt returner didnt fumble twice at the end of 4th Q and OT this woulda happened last yr

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-24 10:08:33	extra tired this morning
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-24 11:54:28	think about it. if we trade revis, we can now sign landry, and on TOP of that, we can get 2 or 3 quality players.
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-24 11:55:27	gotta get something good for him tho
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-24 11:56:26	i gotta tweet more so i can hit 5000 tweets soon
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-24 11:58:11	most of you arent even awake yet tho. its before 7 am. now thats #riseandgrind
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-24 17:14:54	idk what were gonna do. i think matt moore is the best guy to bring in to compete with sanchez
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-24 17:16:26	and i dont mean "best qb" but "best qb that we can get"
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-24 17:17:55	apparently all nfl analysts said before sanchez was even drafted that he would be most succesful in a west coast offense...
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-24 21:29:06	@loosh8905 exactly. buttttt who else do you see? matt flynn and alex smith arent gonna happen.
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-19 02:25:27	@loosh8905 the personnel guy from the seahawks
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-23 20:07:05	thats another work day in the bag. gettin to the gym soon
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-25 22:14:21	when i was like 11, i just thought kelis made really good milkshakes and thats why all the boys journeyed to her yard üòØüòï
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-24 03:19:31	it wasnt our pass D that struggled this year, it was our run D. the defense did just fine without revis, not opposed at ALL
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-24 03:19:54	lets pull a patriots move and get lots of draft picks
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-24 03:20:24	do we really wanna owe 25 million a year to two cornerbacks?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-01-24 03:21:23	look at the giants, why do they beat the pats? eli put up 21 points against the worst secondary in the league so stop with that

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-18 10:43:42	hopefully the jets have two first rounders and we either trade back on both or pick with one and trade back on the other
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-18 10:44:05	we need lots of picks to fill the multiple holes we have in our team

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-21 16:09:01	@damienwoody cros last two seasons were on the same level as revis last two seasons, if you look at it statistically
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-21 19:25:34	trade back with the 9th and get jarvis jones with the 13th. or get one of those two gaurds and jones. cooper or warmack
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-23 16:11:10	jarvis jones at 9 cmonnnn. dont let this playmaker slip away. just take him and take no chances
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-23 16:26:41	@damienwoody is business of nfl so much about looking good that the jets would wait to take (lets say) jarvis jones at 13 instead of 9....
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-23 16:26:53	@damienwoody so the trade of revis could look better for them?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-24 00:20:50	you love him and hate him but jr smith is the man
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-24 00:39:37	jr smith is the man i cannot stress that enough
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-24 00:40:15	each of jrs 4 shots have been a 10 on difficulty and each shot has gone in
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-24 00:40:51	like wtf haha. i cant do that on 2k13
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-24 00:48:05	you think the knicks doctors could just be like "nah amare, you still hurt, you cant play"
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-24 09:33:59	off to work
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-25 15:57:07	@damienwoody what do you try to do for #jets if youre gm? #nfldraft
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-25 20:42:37	thats all you need to read if you wanted to resign revis. i guess we couldve just traded all our draft picks tho http://t.co/TFzKbFYQ7L
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-25 20:42:47	sarcasm obviously
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-25 22:19:42	@KiDJango ill never forget when he got triple teamed by saints 2 Gs and C with jets and he won the battle on the goalline lol hes huge
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-25 23:52:52	@KiDJango agreed. too damn big
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 00:07:34	ok namath. good to see you pregamed the draft
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 00:08:02	thats what i wouldve done lol
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 01:12:51	oh god im so nervous haha. #jets fans, what we do here?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 01:20:19	i like it
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 01:21:34	ok what we do at 13? jarvis? trade back? ? ? ? ?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 01:50:31	ok so i guess complaining how mark sanchez had no options got no where. good luck marky mark. youre going to get destroyed again
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 01:51:04	you guys thought our offense was bad last year? lol
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 01:51:32	his favorite target dustin isnt here for any of the games, ik he was hurt but still
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 02:32:50	@damienwoody what do YOU think?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 02:37:43	rex ryan can make anything a top 5 defense. why do we never give sanchez any help. and forget sanchez. next years qb wont have help either
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 02:38:58	every 1st round pick after sanchez has been defense including 2 this year
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 02:40:15	rexs philosophy. lets just score in defense so we dont need to on offense.
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 02:45:50	well like em or not sheldon and dee are jets. welcome to the fam. i got love for ya
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 02:50:11	gonna be tired at work tmrw. gotta wake up at 5
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 02:53:06	i guess thats pretty average
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 02:53:18	idk. man im shot. bedtime. peace
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-25 16:06:52	i hope we take tavon austin at 9 and trade back the 13 with the 49ers and take their 31 and 34 and we have our 41 where we get CB, TE, and S
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-25 16:07:15	4 starters out of this draft and whatever we do with our other picks
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-28 15:15:23	def gonna wash pearl on this beautiful day
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-28 15:16:18	i wonder what my roomates are makin for dinner tn? (think mamas boy)

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 23:10:56	@SoBL3SSED1 word i hope you right
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-27 00:21:37	question to the jets, can we at least take keenan allen, quinten patton or terrence williams with the 3rd round pick...??
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-27 00:25:00	btw knicks up early brudda lego
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-27 01:09:32	keenan allen please
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-27 01:11:32	we already fucked mark sanchezs career by giving him no help. and now if they decide to go with geno this year we might fuck his too
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-25 21:47:50	draft in 2 hours boii
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 01:29:19	gotta go jarvis jones at 13 but then where we gonna find any offense?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 01:29:55	like jarvis, well have good corners and with coples and wilkerson hopefully takin steps forward pass rush could be considerably better
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 01:30:43	still will hVe the worst skill positions in nfl on offense tho
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 01:54:25	ahh idk
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 01:54:37	why am i a jets fan again?

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 02:39:50	wilson wilkerson coples milliner richardson. well help whoever ends up qb after they lose their job
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 02:40:44	if teams try to punt to us on 4th down... can we defer?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-26 02:46:03	gotta find they twitters

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-29 01:04:08	omfg this comedian just had me crying laughing so hard
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-27 17:49:33	at my cousins lacrosse game. apparently hes a 5 year old prodigy
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-27 19:31:27	hey kellenbergers, the lineman the jets just drafted went to xavarian. that guy oday
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-27 20:44:57	this nets bulls game is crazy. robinson bringing em back real late
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-27 20:45:19	if the nets manage to lose this after bein up 14 with 3 minutes haha
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-27 20:46:14	ik its plenty of time but the way the nets are letting em back in it is terrible, 4 missed FTs and just fouled robinson on a 3
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-27 20:46:58	so in a 80 seconds the bull cut the lead from 14 to 4
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-27 20:47:31	get the fuck outta here haha

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-04-30 11:20:27	nfl logic: the jets need a qb and drafted one? fuckin idiots.
the giants dont need a qb and drafted one? thats how you run a franchise

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-05-27 23:31:55	steelers lost talent with wallace but dont think they lost as much as we think. similar to santonio

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-06-07 01:42:51	when bosh wade allen and chalmers are scoring the heat cant be beat and this is one of the top teams ever assembled
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-06-07 01:43:16	pop is a rediculously good coach tho

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-06-17 03:18:43	its great when you have the best player in the nba on your team. its bad when he doesnt want the ball in situations like tn

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-06-22 10:52:22	i love the chorus theme btw. not talkin hooks but the chorus he has either come sing or if those are samples idk
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-06-22 10:52:39	probly samples but either way. love it

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-06-29 00:48:06	money isnt everything but its way above whatevers number 2
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-06-29 00:50:05	still love the chorus theme born sinner has
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-06-29 22:08:46	so with our defense looking like its ready to make a comeback and run game is supposed to be rejuvenated....
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-06-29 22:09:16	if those things happen. we could make it to the afc championship again. i dont see why not.
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-06-29 22:09:55	sanchez who is "terrible" and "didnt do anything" is still our qb as he was for those years
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-06-29 22:10:23	unless some of you are finally willing to admit he wasnt awful in those years. then you have to agree we could be back there this year...
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-06-29 22:11:51	if our defense and run game live up to the hype
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-06-29 22:12:44	but if you say he was horrible in the playoffs and all season those two years then we have a perfectly good shot at making it back
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-06-29 22:15:58	just spittin random thoughts
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-06-29 11:12:32	cop just went thru a red light and into a do not enter one way. didnt even put his lights on. damn man at least make it look important

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-09 23:34:44	i cant hold it in any more. IM SO FUCKIN HAPPY JETS SEASON IS BACK
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-09 23:41:23	coples and wilkerson gonna be unreal

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-09 23:47:01	whered i put my geno jersy?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-10 00:12:48	the offense in general looks so much better than last year
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-10 00:12:59	sparano had no clue how to run an offense
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-10 00:14:21	a drive like that makes you say, "mark, youre fuckin good. just be consistent"
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-10 00:15:23	anyway back to what i was saying about the offense, how much crisper does it look this year than last year?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-10 00:17:45	thats why i ordered my 96 jersey
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-10 00:36:47	i like what i see so far. offensive scheme looks a lot better, spacing is better route combos. o line will get better by playing tg more
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-10 00:37:01	defense looks real good. this defense could be real special
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-10 00:41:49	chris ivory will be nice to have back too

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-25 01:02:16	geno likes obamanu
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-25 03:22:28	so after geno proved he cant play against one of the worst secondaries in the nfl mark sanchez once again proved why hes been in competition
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-23 21:21:49	@__Mimiii ctfu!!! turn on the light for ya man
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-25 14:13:48	big seans def all like "kendrick why you say some dumb shit? now papoose yellin at me and he from coney island and shit" üò∞
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-24 23:49:18	que the jets fans turning back to the man who brought them to back to back afc championships. whether you wanna believe he had a part or not
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-25 00:19:23	do you really give a fuck on a 6 yrd pass in the preseason? cmon man
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-25 03:23:01	so were drafting another qb next year
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-25 00:09:24	mark or geno?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-25 00:41:43	whos starting geno? whos that dumb right now? or that drunk right now?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-08-26 00:03:26	when you sing happy birthday to more than one person and everyone cornily laughs bc everyone messed the song up it makes me so uncomfortable
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-02 18:28:54	now whos starting?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-05 22:10:24	santonio to play week 1. probly doesnt matter #nyjets but ill take any bit of optimism right now
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-06 00:32:53	i love the jets so much. ik theyre not playing but i just cant wait
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-06 00:35:12	this wouldnt be a problem if the fuckin orioles would have moved their game
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-06 00:57:39	what really happened is seacrest introduced the kickoff of the season and the players became disinterested
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-06 00:58:30	theyre flying in waka flocka to hype up the crowd
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-06 01:11:33	i wish this game started 40 minutes ago. already tired and yawning
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-08 14:11:20	omw to the game. lets fuckin go jets
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-08 15:57:34	ok so everyone who went to unqua is now jealous
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-08 15:57:49	i just did a shotgun with mr mulchahey. my 6th grade math teacher
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-09 01:08:57	to play that badly and be tied 3-3. idk if that says more about the giants or cowboys
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-09 02:19:12	soo david wilson is in tom coughlins dog house
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-09 02:20:01	but idk any other giants rbs besides andre brown
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-10 12:37:56	@DolaOcho looks like you gettin your chance this week. take advantage
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-08 00:28:52	kendrick decided to quit after all those disses came back at him and made that soft terrible song
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-08 02:18:52	seeing a qb with 98 is the dumbest thing ever
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-08 02:58:34	thats what you get for being number 98
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-12 11:50:09	gameday once again
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-12 13:20:48	@mowilkerson good luck today mo. lets get this W
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-13 02:08:58	if they call a touchdown here the games rigged
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-13 02:18:02	so whos talking shit about tom brady for all these missed throws? you meant to tell me you need quality wrs?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-13 02:18:29	oh? but mark sanchez didnt. he was supposed to be good all on his own
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-13 02:24:14	@loosh8905 so he didnt miss 3 deep passes?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-13 02:25:30	@loosh8905 not only that but im talkin shit about the wrs.. not tom brady
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-13 02:32:20	@loosh8905 yo he overthrew at a minimum twice
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-13 02:47:04	marty knows what hes doin
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-13 02:47:40	idc what you say about the calls last game or this game. hes protecting the young guy while still givin an opportunity to make plays
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-13 02:48:09	and geno is patient. maybe too patient sometimes but hes not forcing it and hes tough and hell take hits instead of throw picks
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-13 03:06:27	ok so neither teams wrs can catch
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-13 10:40:55	we need wide recievers who can effectively recieve the ball no matter whos playing qb
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-13 11:20:18	it looked ugly and we had a chance to win so obviously its a tough loss. but look at it what it is
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-13 11:20:54	its a loss on the road in NE with a rookie qb. we werent supposed to win. get back on track vs buffalo
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-15 22:20:37	watchin peyton make calls and read defenses is great football to watch. unless youre rooting for the opposing team
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-15 22:28:32	as i analyze football more and more i realize eli should def be in the top 5. he throws a lot of deep passes so youre bound to have picks
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-15 22:29:09	alot of the better qbs. perfect example is peyton. look at all his short high percentage throws
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-15 22:35:09	dc who wins but the ref messed that call up. bad call
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-16 00:31:00	i picked 9ers but think seahawks will win
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-17 00:55:21	dalton looks miserable
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-19 02:02:09	@cj_ferriggi woah woah woah. you got twitter? lol what?

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-27 00:58:50	@JasonLaCanfora is it rams defense or is this the 49ers offense that scored only 7 against the colts?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-30 10:02:57	one day off just isnt enough
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-30 10:22:51	still jet life tho
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-09-29 14:48:49	gameday. #jetup lets eat out there. titans are food. @mowilkerson @Godforshort @QueCeasar @BigDame900
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-06 21:03:41	peyton isnt real
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-06 21:03:55	eli is very real tho
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-06 22:17:50	the year that the jets would have a better reg season record than the giants steelers cowboys (which are my surroundings).....
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-06 22:18:09	i thought that would mean the jets are good
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-06 22:21:28	but were rebuilding
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-06 20:07:33	the giants realy are bad. i thought they were just playing bad and they would turn it around. but no. they truly suck
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-06 20:13:55	how can a 2 time superbowl mvp not even be a top 10 qb? awesome dline and wrs that turn slants into tds twice a game
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-07 22:00:31	@loosh8905 what do you expect from us tn? just curious to see other takes on it
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-07 23:03:59	@loosh8905 couldnt agree more. im not looking for geno to light it up each week. i wanna see if he can progress throughout the year
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-07 23:07:37	@loosh8905 ikkk ikk thats something we seriously gotta fix. gonna be a tough outing for kyle tn. like every other week

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-25 10:09:17	@KiDJango i think that might have something to do with his knee. when he was with the jets something that everyone always pointed out was...
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-25 10:09:57	@KiDJango how good he is in run support. he was always known as one of the better tacklers in the league. idk what happened
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-27 20:33:34	didnt think it was gonna be this bad
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-27 21:19:12	if we score a td itll be 21-10 at half just like last week. except this game feels so different
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-27 21:52:43	this is going well
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-27 21:52:47	i need a drink
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-27 21:55:02	the fact rex ryan can be 4-3 on the way to 4-4 with THIS roster is proof he deserves to keep his job. this team lacks talent in many areas

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-10-30 17:44:18	@damienwoody then would you say the same for sanchez? his worst season had this same offense with an incompetent coordinator
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-02 00:11:35	johnny dramaaaa is the mannnn haha

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-03 18:41:29	@KyleLass hes not even good enough to be pur starting safety and he covers their best player
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-03 18:43:10	@KyleLass sometimes he has too much confidence in his guys
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-03 18:45:52	we just have no skill position players that can really make a difference
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-03 18:47:12	that jets crowd is great
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-03 19:01:37	no one can get open!
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-03 19:03:22	already with no talent on offense cumberland holmes and kerley all out. theres gotta be college teams with more skill position talent

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-12 02:42:43	whats great about revis is, when healthy, he is also one of the very best tackling corners in the league. complete corner
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-12 02:42:59	still gonna root for him even if hes not on the jets
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-12 11:36:34	@kwenthen that just aint right

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-17 18:07:55	please dont be a serious injury
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-17 19:09:30	ok geno. time to start makin improvements on how quickly you get rid of the ball
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-17 19:16:48	when one thing goes wrong for the jets, they seem to just make more and more bad plays. its always a domino effect
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-14 17:51:34	@Black_Brutha_15 can you say SUPERBOWL CHAMPS! legooooo!!!! hahha
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-14 18:00:41	@Black_Brutha_15 itll be between him and andy reid

214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-24 23:29:22	whatd you guys think? the giants have only beaten the shitiest teams
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-24 23:29:57	even tho the jets suck at least we somehow have miraculous wins agianst new england and new orleans
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-24 21:06:40	the packers will be the only to team trade the same qb for a 1st round pick at least twice
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-27 21:37:10	@RealSkipBayless lmao basicaly youre calling him a vagina
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-11-28 01:45:55	lmao at that sharkeisha shit that was fuckin raw. #worldstar
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-02 11:21:32	@ivory33 way to battle out there man. keep fight. well get a win
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-02 22:34:11	@loosh8905 probly because hills a good blocker and running the ball is all that matters in rexs mind lol
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-02 23:08:54	@damienwoody i love rex but i dnt think he allow young qb to progress &amp; grow in an off but now were rebuilding so this is the time for that
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-03 02:39:29	@lgonzalesjets @BigDame900 @willcolon66 i bet snacks knows damn well how to cook! haha
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 00:17:38	auburn. i cant get over that play ahha. im still thinkin bout it
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 00:25:36	holy fuckin shit!!!
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 00:25:43	this is rediculous
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 00:26:13	im in awe. i had such a feeling
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 00:28:59	this is so great hahah i cant believe it
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 00:29:58	with what? like 40 seconds left auburn was down 7. 40 seconds later they won by 6
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 00:34:05	who wants to go to auburn? theres def gonna be an insane party
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 00:46:01	im not sold on manziel as a great nfl qb, and not sure i ever will be till he does it in nfl
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 21:04:55	although geno smiths seems to be buttcheeks. him, sanchez and simms have proves that this offense has no talent
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 21:05:33	so many bad routes, dropped passes, leaky protection and no separation. no young qb can learn like that
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 21:13:57	@loosh8905 i am too. i have been for several years. i thought it was bad for sanchez but now looking back, sanchez had it good. this is bad
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 22:35:36	i wonder what that was with moreno
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 22:36:13	if you missed it, tears rushed down his face as he made the sign of the cross and pointed to sky
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 23:00:28	@SportBlogNYC because he can block and all that matters is running the ball and defense
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 23:01:51	@KiDJango i guess they were close? i wasnt really thinking that
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-01 23:27:12	peyton manning is the man. so good
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-10 03:02:14	why the fuck didnt we draft jeffery. we got stephen hill
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-08 19:08:00	tone has to catch that. tell me these wrs help out their qb
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-08 19:42:05	jesus. chris ivory murdereeeeddd him
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-08 22:22:09	@BigDame900 didnt let us down. keep workin hard and thats all we can ask. congrats on the win. good luck next week
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 19:05:30	paysinger just got tossed back by only marshawn lynchs upper body. thank god buffalo let that man go
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 19:05:40	imagine we had to deal with that twice a year still
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 21:15:06	get holmes off my team
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 21:15:50	thats bullshit
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 21:16:28	no qb can succeed with this group of players
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 21:17:44	and when i said keep braylon get rid of holmes everyone mocked me. holmes fuckin sucks. theres a reason the STEELERS got rid of him
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 21:17:50	were seein that now
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 22:27:05	@eallenjets well thats because 3 statistics cant tell the story of an entire game. what have they held us to? and what have they thrown for?
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 22:27:22	fuckin dumbass
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 22:37:43	think weapons dont matter? and its all about the qb? look no further than matt flynn
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 22:38:39	2 years ago hes the next big thing with all greenbays weapons. now hes been horrible on 3-4 different teams with not as many weapons
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 22:39:00	to be fair he got beat out by a very promising russel wilson in seattle
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 22:39:39	who btw is one of my favorite non jets. rus wilson is very well spoken, humble, great model for the nfl
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 23:45:22	not saying geno is qb of the future, but if you can look at details in a qbs game, you can see the progression he has made
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 23:46:07	he has come a longggggggg way. evident today against one of the nfls best defenses with one of the nfls worst supporting offensive casts
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 23:57:54	@QuizyFBabyy if tim tebow was at all decent. he would be at least a backup qb in the league
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 23:58:30	@QuizyFBabyy 32 teams, minimun 64 qbs in the league. tim tebow cant get one job
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-15 23:59:00	@QuizyFBabyy theres a reason
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-16 00:00:16	@QuizyFBabyy he coulda been a backup for any team with a qb. including pats packers cowboys giants saints or even ravens since they like WC
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-16 00:12:35	ill tell you what tho the jets best drive was when they let geno throw it now we still have negative wrs but if we invest in that position..
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-16 00:45:25	that tony romo. cowboys fans fav player ever in september-november. most hated player ever in december and january
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-19 03:02:58	its gonna be 62 degrees sunday. wow
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-22 23:14:36	@BigDame900 love you guys congrats. thanks for playin hard
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-18 13:03:04	@Black_Brutha_15 now THAT is whats wrong wit females today
214962262	DMassaro27	2013-12-18 13:07:19	@Black_Brutha_15 lmao never underestimate someone in this era. everytime i do im shocked again

214962262	DMassaro27	2014-03-11 01:25:27	@damienwoody obviously hypothetically, but how much money do you think itd be worth it (from jets point of view only) to bring back revis
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-03-13 13:11:48	@damienwoody imagine a formation with desean and riley outside and you got lesean and sproles on both sides of foles
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-03-12 01:49:15	@eallenjets we cant use all 39 mil anyway. have people forgot we need to give mo wilkerson a big contract in the near future?
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-03-12 01:50:44	@damienwoody yeah you get one shot. and its not easy. if you build a long term team you can be competitive for a decade

214962262	DMassaro27	2014-04-15 14:22:44	@TurnOnTheJets its only the fans that can't help themselves but to hate on every move. always hat in
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-04-15 14:23:27	@TurnOnTheJets if we let CJ go without attempting to sign him, same people would be like, oh Idzik's so cheap!!

214962262	DMassaro27	2014-04-29 16:52:27	@KiDJango i hope the jets never to hardknocks again... EVER.. but the giants have a functional team can probably handle it haha
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-05-01 17:59:35	@TurnOnTheJets i saw in a recent mock cj mosley falling to the dolphins. if he does fall to the jets i would think we strongly consider no?
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-05-01 18:18:34	@TurnOnTheJets agreed. another note. i could see us swapping spots with dallas. they wanna move down and we could jump ravens who might...
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-05-01 18:18:48	@TurnOnTheJets trade their pick to someone, who is looking to jump us
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-05-01 18:20:36	@TurnOnTheJets if right player available of course.. wouldnt cost too much to go up two spots
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-05-05 23:26:41	@cheddaaacheese they eat insects in the yard that eat her plants

214962262	DMassaro27	2014-05-11 23:08:17	@TurnOnTheJets expect alot of two TE sets? i envision amaro lined up outside alot. i also can see kerley and saunders on field at same time
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-05-11 23:23:15	@jetoffensive @TurnOnTheJets yeah he looks promising. if marty figures out how to properly put everyone in position to succeed the offense..
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-05-11 23:23:44	@jetoffensive @TurnOnTheJets can make some serious strides here. obviously development of geno helps as well
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-05-11 12:25:24	i hate how they make you say "give up" if you lose on candy crush. really make you feel like a failure

214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-04 10:39:36	actually lost one friend in particular at kings due to poor handling of a situation. i look back and regret from time to time
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-04 10:40:44	#earlymorning with nobody awake and out on the streets got me feelin all peaceful and thinkin alot
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-04 11:18:48	listenin to that kdot freestyle on power 106 from a little while ago and my man @jgillie302 can freestyle just as good if not better #truth

214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 21:01:25	jesus. stupid penalties continue. that kills
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 21:04:14	@RichCimini can we get a drive that doesnt include a penalty too? 3rd and long is not how you move down the feild
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 21:12:24	can kyle wilson never play for us again please?
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 21:15:40	finally a pick holy shit
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 21:26:06	anouncer say "idk what unneccessary roughness is. bad call" its the fact that everyone calls EVERYTHING on the jets
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 21:52:49	fucking geno, dropping that pass. what an asshole
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 22:08:01	vicks gonna play
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 22:09:29	this sucks
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 22:11:58	finally a 3rd and get off the field
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 22:13:36	this should be interesting
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 22:20:41	going well so far. could it be the offense just sucks? penalty discipline continues, wrs with no separation. not much you can do
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 22:29:49	pryor gotta wrap up
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 22:30:35	here comes vick part two. this will probably go better
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 22:39:13	well. im sure glad vicks in
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 22:40:14	he is THAT good. that he can win with NOBODY to help him out. what do we think was gonna happen?
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 22:40:46	tell me you really thought vick would march right down the field? haha
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 22:44:52	i thought vick was gonna make those catches when he came him? @TurnOnTheJets
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 22:58:53	vicks like "shit man, this what geno was dealin wit? these bum asses?"
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 23:00:58	@TurnOnTheJets we have 65 total yards on offense. we also have been penalized 10 times for 84 yards
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-10-05 23:01:17	‚Äú@TheJetReport: You know who is REALLY laughing, watching this? Mark Sanchez. #jets‚Äù YESSSSSS

214962262	DMassaro27	2014-11-24 12:59:57	@TurnOnTheJets @brian_muldowney i dont think percy would mind taking less if it meant some garuntees were added to the contract
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-11-24 02:06:18	wtf? how????? #odb
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-11-24 12:53:33	@TurnOnTheJets in other words, since others might still not understand, there are 53 players on a football team and 22 spots on Off and Def
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-11-24 12:53:44	@TurnOnTheJets not just wr
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-11-24 12:55:02	@TurnOnTheJets absolutely. i wanted amari until percy came. but i certainly can understand why ppl still want amari. he looks so flith haha
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-11-24 12:58:16	@TurnOnTheJets honestly tho there so many things that could happen this spring (frnt off for ex) that it impossible to fig out whatll happen

lookin at it this way. i hate the fins. would love to beat them. always want the jets to win whether seasons over or not
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-02 02:45:14	litterally laughing at the jets
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-02 02:46:03	lets not call a timeout to try and make something happen with 40 seconds left, but lets freeze the kicker to end the half... comical
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-03 01:41:14	@BMaldz idk. i too have been known to see the future
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-03 02:37:06	my sports teams that arent named the jets keep me sane. thank you @umichbball and @NYIslanders for going 2-0 tn

214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-05 02:34:20	@CRogers_NFL u think if we take collins, we move brick to right side? N you think that helps him be more successful at this point in career?
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-05 22:08:20	Anybody got the galaxy? I neeeeeed help
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-07 18:05:03	Wow man. Why do I still watch?
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-07 18:06:26	I bet they run it every single play on this drive
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-07 18:06:57	And I'm pretty sure the Vikings know it
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-07 18:12:13	I must say that although idzik deserves his bashings, he did bring in ivory, percy, decker, and Sheldon. Aboushi has flashed early as well
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-07 18:14:01	Also like amaros potential. With a lot of cap space this offseason, there is a chance to get better.
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-11 01:57:40	Finally got some time to sit and listen to forest hills drive. Psyched

214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-14 21:56:41	Well that's coaching
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-14 23:32:49	@CRogers_NFL @TurnOnTheJets lmao you hear the announcer try to pronounce ik's last name
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-14 23:33:56	@TurnOnTheJets @CRogers_NFL haha now I'm not claiming I can, but it was certainly funny to hear
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-14 23:35:02	@CRogers_NFL @TurnOnTheJets it was bad enough that I hope so bad he makes many more plays so I can keep hearing them try
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-15 00:02:07	I don't get how jets fans literally can root for a loss. You're not a fan in my eyes if you are
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-15 00:22:49	People are really that high on mariota like he's a garunteed star. I'm not that sold
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-15 00:46:13	@Connor_J_Hughes didn't we beat them his rookie season
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-14 17:45:28	@TurnOnTheJets if FSU does win the whole thing again. How do you not consider a kid who has never lost a college game? At least consider
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-14 18:03:50	I hate the patriots. But I truly do hate the dolphins just as much
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-14 18:21:34	That was a dumb ass play call by browns
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-14 19:13:01	The best thing manziel has goin for him so far is people can't wait to taunt him and get penalized for it
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-15 12:54:14	Nice watch.. run it
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-15 15:28:29	@TurnOnTheJets I already like winston better from strictly football.  But I'd be lying if I said his off field issues didn't concern me
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-15 15:31:37	Who play trivia crack?
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-18 18:33:16	@BMaldz most addicting game ever

214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-24 15:02:54	@TurnOnTheJets the dangers of judging a player too soon, or off of too few performances

214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-28 20:30:09	@TurnOnTheJets decker 9 targets, 9 catches. Throw the man the ball
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-28 20:31:57	@TurnOnTheJets is one of the qualifactions of being a "number 1" wr that the other team decides they need to put their top corner on you?
214962262	DMassaro27	2014-12-29 14:19:53	@tim_kovach @DrewfromJersey @KPNYJ noone wanted it bc woody forced rex on them. Sent all the qualified GMS packing. Thats the difference now

214962262	DMassaro27	2015-01-02 21:08:19	@TurnOnTheJets @gavdbuck If you do conditional, it would have to be next years draft
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-01-02 20:50:01	@Connor_J_Hughes @Kza555 Therefore the pick would not be this years draft anyway

214962262	DMassaro27	2015-01-11 19:22:41	@TurnOnTheJets Are you concluding something there or just stating facts? Serious question
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-01-11 19:34:36	@TurnOnTheJets Can I add Alfred blue to that?
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-01-11 19:38:29	@TurnOnTheJets Wow interesting. Didn't think of that. Breno a nasty run blocker. Good to move to gaurd for a year till you Find long term

214962262	DMassaro27	2015-02-19 17:19:59	@TurnOnTheJets Wouldn't be terrible to see ivory run out of a spread either. I'll take him vs a defensive back every time if we can get that

214962262	DMassaro27	2015-02-20 02:06:12	@CRogers_NFL well do you sign someone else then bc you don't want to handicap yourself in the draft saying you "have to come out with a rb"
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-02-20 02:06:41	@CRogers_NFL Unless we resign bilal
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-02-20 02:07:33	@CRogers_NFL Hearing he wants to test fa but I have hoped to have him back all along as well
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-02-20 02:08:49	@CRogers_NFL Yeah especially after reports that we want spiller. He'd clearly be 3rd on the depth chart yet again
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-02-20 02:12:27	@DrewfromJersey @CRogers_NFL He seems "slippery" defenders seemed to have a tough time bringing him down

214962262	DMassaro27	2015-03-05 15:20:07	@TurnOnTheJets Does that make you think we got a shot at Hughes?
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-03-06 18:48:27	@TurnOnTheJets I like the move but man. Who is David Harris agent? I need that guy to negotiate my pay a little. Harris keeps getting paid

214962262	DMassaro27	2015-03-10 16:48:46	@Mezz_CAPO i love cro as a person, but don't really want him this year. play fell off too much at end of last year,think his age catching up
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-03-10 16:51:03	@Mezz_CAPO yeah if the moneys right it'll be good. if we got revis maybe hell be reenergized for the full season instead of 1st 10 games hah
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-03-10 02:19:04	Wow tavares. How?
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-03-10 22:13:42	@Jason_OTC @KS1988NYJ Once the deal gets to those years where he's making less hell just hold out again
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-03-11 01:51:59	Luckily I kept my revis jersey
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-03-11 02:11:57	@damienwoody If I'm at a job, and another job offers me more money, I'm gonna strongly consider that job
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-03-11 03:09:51	@Connor_J_Hughes @spotrac Does that include releasing harvin?
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-03-12 16:14:39	@TurnOnTheJets just for competition? It is veterans minimum. Can be cut if he doesn't make the team
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-03-14 04:54:37	My opinion on mariota is being swayed.

214962262	DMassaro27	2015-03-14 19:48:30	@TurnOnTheJets I want whoever wins the job to be given the job. I think it sends a better msg to the tm. Thats what I want from this qb comp

214962262	DMassaro27	2015-04-25 23:41:26	#stillmatic just may be my favorite all time album. I can listen to this at any point on any day
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-01 09:28:06	Having flashbacks of the Sheldon pick. Todd bowles knows how to use lots of dlineman. He did it in Arizona, hell do it here
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-02 00:01:11	Gotta like what both jets and giants did so far in the draft
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-01 00:08:00	Cmon jets don't do something stupid today. Make this a good night please
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-01 00:24:41	Cmon jags. Don't pick fowler don't pick fowler don't pick fowler don't pick fowler
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-01 01:03:00	Leonard williams, Mo Wilkerson Sheldon can all play any spot on the 3-4 defensive lime. All versatile players. Will be moved around alot
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-01 01:04:44	@KyleLass bowles plays a decent amount with 4 down lineman. Its a 3-4 base but he also often goes to nickel with 4 lineman
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-01 01:29:35	@KyleLass I agree to a certain point. But when arguably the best player in the entire draft falls to you at 6. Idk how you don't take him
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-01 01:30:04	@KyleLass he was best available for bucks, now 5 guys off the board, now he's really the best available
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-01 01:31:30	Tells you everything you need to know https://t.co/hw2Oo6Gn1Z
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-01 01:33:36	Can't believe not a single trade happened yet
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-01 09:29:15	Bw Mo shells and now Williams, we have 3 guys that will require 5-6 guys to block depending on who's across the ball. This is dangerous
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-01 09:32:12	Why am I tweeting to myself basically at 530 in the morning? No ones awake now, #gymtime #nodaysoff #riseandgrind

214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-02 13:20:30	@thewordofbob31 haha you'd think everyone in this draft is gonna be a star with the comparisons they been makin
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-02 16:34:04	Why draft a qb worse then geno
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-07 13:51:08	I just wanna be home all day watching my new 50 inch tv
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-09 01:13:40	Braden and Henrik playin out they minds
214962262	DMassaro27	2015-05-14 00:10:35	Wow. With how good both these goaltenders are playing, its gonna take plays like that to score. These guys battling out there
