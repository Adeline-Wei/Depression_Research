2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-04-21 03:05:53	Nobody on the Warriors can score on AD.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-04-21 03:14:48	If the Pelicans are going to win this game or series, AD will have to play every minute.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-04-21 03:27:17	Jets puck passing is silky right now.

2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-04-21 04:25:31	The Ducks just out-experienced Winnipeg in each of the first three games.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-04-21 04:31:18	AD can put the whole world on notice with a great 4th quarter.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-04-21 04:35:05	Pelicans don't know what the fuck they're supposed to be doing.

2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-04-25 23:28:43	When Pau is hitting that shot, the Bulls are elite.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-04-25 23:32:28	Dunleavy is this generation's Jud Buechler.

2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-11 01:49:11	Lightning players just wait for Chicago players to bounce off of them and then continue on with their business.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-11 01:50:49	Andrei is legit, for now.

2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-15 18:51:45	Will @CNN devote a week of reporting on this? https://t.co/3E5jUy3Luq
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-15 19:04:53	Unfortunately, you're both correct. https://t.co/zz2P3vanN2
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 01:34:10	@DSMac27 That enough for ya?
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 01:41:04	Saad got a highstick there.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 02:28:10	Wow, Bishop has done almost all he can.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 02:32:55	FOR FUCKS SAKE show some GOTDAMN fight Tampa Bay!
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 02:40:04	Fuck it.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 02:50:49	Blackhawks showed up and the Lightning didn't, simple as that.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-15 01:49:18	Nothing like pig and fire. #PartsUnknown
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-17 02:19:40	Thompson has got your back.

2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-15 23:36:41	"Sir Mookie."  
"Yes Xander?"
"No, I'm Knighting you."
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 00:39:49	Both teams skating well.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 00:41:20	@DSMac27 That puck practically married the crossbar.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 00:45:41	@DSMac27 It'll come, always does at some point with Toews and Keith.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-17 03:08:23	Good block

2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 07:23:06	@DSMac27 They're anticipating the Shillue bump. #RedEye
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 07:26:05	You could see the wheels turning in Dagen's head. #RedEye
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 00:47:38	Not sneakysneaky, sir. https://t.co/QJ59COJh1f
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 00:50:28	@DSMac27 Lightning size accounts for most of that, takes its toll too.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 00:53:29	@DSMac27 If they can get Bishop moving side to side, the way he's hurting, it would definitely help.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 00:56:47	Goodfellas isn't a guiding light of loyalty. #Kennedy

2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 01:44:13	@DSMac27 Blackhawks had a 15 shot flurry.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 01:45:36	@DSMac27 Unbelievable.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 01:48:21	@DSMac27 Arrrrgh.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 21:11:37	Please tell me Kimberly didn't use name recognition about Trump's bad polling. #TheFive
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 01:51:53	@DSMac27 Not very fluid, but exciting in spots.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 01:52:47	That's an idiotic penalty.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 01:54:12	That was the loudest post ever.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 01:56:17	@DSMac27 Yeah, for about 5-7 minutes mid-period it was streamline.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 02:23:11	Lightning don't seem that urgent to score.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 03:07:36	Stanley is a beautiful sumbitch ain't he.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 21:13:50	Entertaining yes, refreshing no. #TheFive
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 03:15:44	Congratulations @DSMac27
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 03:17:27	@myregularface Thanks for all you do and good luck tomorrow.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 03:20:16	@DSMac27 YW, it was and y'all earned it.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 03:24:06	@DSMac27 Hopefully the Preds can put up a little more resistance next year, but it seems to be the nature of things.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-16 03:26:38	@DSMac27 The Joy of Hope!
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-17 03:17:47	That is not a flagrant.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-17 03:23:59	Curry needs to take the game over.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-17 03:29:11	Don Nelson would give the #NBAFinals MVP to Iguodala.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-17 03:33:46	Checkmate.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-17 03:35:37	@katienolan @Bro_Pair THIS....is CNN?
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-17 03:44:03	That effort explains it.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-17 03:49:03	It's setting in for Mark.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-17 03:54:09	Steve Kerr is a ring magnet.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-17 03:56:27	Watch him hit both.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-17 03:58:19	Good job Lebron.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-17 04:09:52	They got it right.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-17 04:19:33	Bogut is exhausted from that.

2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-18 23:38:30	People going to their political corners, regarding #CharlestonShooting, is sickening.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-18 23:39:12	@awj9009 @DSMac27 That's it exactly, well said.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-19 00:37:59	@ForeverBigBlue Thats awesome, congratulations!
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-19 00:40:36	@ForeverBigBlue Your first? I was lucky and got one when I was 15.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-19 00:40:57	@GolfFanUKMan @ForeverBigBlue Keep trying!
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-19 00:42:53	@ForeverBigBlue Wow!  Made the rest of the day hard to live up to haha
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-19 00:44:37	@ForeverBigBlue Good advice, just make sure to do that next time!
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-19 00:48:54	@ForeverBigBlue Oh well, Lexus didn't have a car to win on the par 3?
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-19 00:51:16	@ForeverBigBlue You cannot be serious!?!?  That will take a while to get over, so have a clubhouse, microwaveable chicken sandwich on me.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-19 00:54:21	@ForeverBigBlue Life's cruel aspects of joy.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-18 04:23:05	Young People, as I say this 31 years old, are taking police for granted and don't understand the first thing about Liberty and their rights.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-18 04:25:29	Lesson 1: Dont lie to police.  Just because you heard the cool person say snitches get stitches, it doesn't effect you.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-18 04:28:24	Lesson 2:  A man who has been state raised, I can tell you..crime does not pay.  If you enjoy a meal consistent with monkey heart, continue.
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-18 04:29:22	Lesson 3: So when an officer of the law tells you to put your hands behind your back------&gt;
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-18 04:30:19	I don't care if you're feeding Mother Theresa's breast milk to the Baby 
Jesus-----&gt;
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-18 04:31:56	Comply and have your day in court.  There's a thing called the Constitution, that most people could use in your favor---&gt;
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-18 04:35:10	Lesson 3: Don't piss off the cook and definitely don't piss off the bartender------------&gt;
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-18 04:36:47	Do these things and I promise to God, your life will be better for it.  White, black, asian, or hispanic, these Liberties are granted to you
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-18 04:41:45	@inyosub I was out and missed it, damn it!
2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-18 05:46:21	@katienolan Okay, Marla Hooch is up for MVP against "Big" Dottie Hinson, who ya got?  Keep in mind Marla is raking and serenading Nelson.

2206179140	PeteScottPPool	2015-06-18 23:11:04	That snapchat video of the pastor and his brothers and sisters teaching God's love to that young man is heartbreaking.
