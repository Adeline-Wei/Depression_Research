2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-07-24 14:33:53	If the river banks are too wide, the current would be lame. If the river banks narrows, the current would be strong to produce hydro energy.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-07-24 14:35:04	Hydro electric energies are far more cleaner and safer.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-07-24 15:10:50	Traditionally, water mills are wooden. Would the cycles of mills be enough to produce an acceptable amount of energy?

2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-11-27 18:24:15	The future of energy is not petroleum. The future of energy is a new word, a new vocabulary and a new term.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-11-27 18:42:46	The energy crisis shall fade. Our leaders would write a new chapter about energy after Thanksgiving holiday have ensued.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-11-27 18:53:10	There are reasons why energy markets are breaking new grounds in the business world. The business world would never be same after change.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-11-29 03:40:07	Perhaps, the Ancient Aliens left behind clues. Puzzles. The early humans did their best to express what they saw in their frame of mind.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-11-29 04:09:58	Do I believe in Ancient Aliens? I'm neutral. I believe in "evidences".

2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-11-29 04:42:41	In a dream, the past becomes alive. Only in a dream, time becomes fluid. A Dali' painting.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-11-29 04:53:34	I'm getting tired of all the junk on twitter. No offense intended. Why I'm on twitter? I don't know. Maybe, I would quit.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-11-29 04:59:01	Twitter is sort of a lighthouse. My only line to the outside world. The outside world want to look into my brains. Cool with me.

2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-11-30 22:52:10	There are people who purposely try to trigger emotions out of others. I find that disturbing.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-11-30 22:57:11	Lucky is something like finding the right woman, surviving a near-death experience, winning a lottery, inventing energy and being rich.

2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-01 00:02:27	I think the timeline and the quality of words would prove otherwise. People were in genuine panic.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-01 00:08:06	At least, choosing your own battles are something Sun Tzu would agree at.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-01 00:33:25	A turtle defends itself by hiding in a shell. We take a lot for granted. A horse gallops. God's Calvary.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-01 00:51:12	Water would have to simply gravitate towards a lower-pressure-zone, a dry-zone and towards a vacuum.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-01 00:51:32	The cane-pipe would have to channel the water from a curve of a cane-pipe to a dry-zone.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-01 00:54:41	Imagine no longer having to pump gas. Imagine a world without reliance on fossil fuels, petroleum. Pretty strange, eh?
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-01 00:55:44	You could simply burn saw dust and call it energy. Coal energy help industrialize the "Industrial Age".
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-01 01:00:40	Pollution is expensive to clean. Coal energy would be very polluting without proper vessels and channels being built. Be creative.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-01 01:03:17	Gasoline has explosive qualities that makes it perfect for engines. Ethanol is used for cars, too. Ethanol is from corn.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-01 19:29:34	In this password-hunting world, with everybody trying to discredit me, I would take the long walk out.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-01 19:33:06	How could that be? With sealed-air under the depth of water could pull a rabbit out of a top hat from deception of pressure.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-01 19:33:23	Simple fact of air-sealed under the water could be the energy of the future. They said the same about ethanol, solar panels and wind.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-02 00:33:21	American way of life is worthy of protection. Patriotic language do turn off foreigners. This is not my intention, at all.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-02 00:37:19	There are no evil nations out there whose only mission is destruction of earth. Most nations are really good-heartened.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-02 01:01:52	Most nations out there just want to mind their own business. Farm their land. Fish in their waters. Live up their cultures. Am I right?

2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-03 05:08:10	Susan B. Anthony fought for women rights when they weren't allowed to vote! Imagine that.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-03 05:15:01	There are rich histories behind this woman. Women are superior in many ways. So, there's a positive compliment.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-03 05:18:08	My thoughts are about protecting rights that are won from difficult battles.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-03 05:44:25	Words cost a lot of brain power. How much thinking do you have to apply for every sentence? Tons.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-04 20:37:49	I think most about the people I knew. Yet, I never really got to know that person. So, there is a debt on the conscience. Strangely.

2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-06 08:52:15	The spun weight would have to be connected to a disk that is attached to an electrical generator.
2212408807	BlakeMiller50	2014-12-06 09:00:40	The future of winches are reels of a "science-fiction turned into reality". Anybody who loves science should delight in this.
