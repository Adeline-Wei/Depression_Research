22485366	WhatTheKeckSays	2012-03-07 22:55:18	My reasoning is simple. Need a reason to Get excited about? because it's #TheWiz damnit!
22485366	WhatTheKeckSays	2012-03-08 11:57:03	Time to get up and at them. The road isn't going to ease on down itself. #TheWiz today
22485366	WhatTheKeckSays	2012-03-09 03:50:56	«@StuntinSteve "The Wiz" at Eastmoor was definitely on point... Everyone should make it their duty to go and support the show and cast...»

22485366	WhatTheKeckSays	2012-03-10 13:59:44	So calling off of work and getting 4 more hours of sleep before the show was definitely a good idea.
22485366	WhatTheKeckSays	2012-03-10 16:09:14	@iMA_Munch_CAN so it's not really a cast party, right
22485366	WhatTheKeckSays	2012-03-10 19:54:09	@MszEclectik are you still coming to the wiz?

22485366	WhatTheKeckSays	2012-06-08 01:54:52	@mattseward2 it's simple. Boston isn't athletic enough to keep up, and Miami doesn't have the team concept to outlast.
22485366	WhatTheKeckSays	2012-06-08 02:53:27	For anyone who thinks I've been quiet, I have plenty to say, you just have to be around when I'm saying it.
22485366	WhatTheKeckSays	2012-06-08 03:02:26	For the record, no matter the results of tonight's game, LeBron still hasn't won shit, and that doesn't change until they raise the trophy.
22485366	WhatTheKeckSays	2012-06-08 03:06:27	@mattseward2 by the way, the Lakers have 17 titles.

22485366	WhatTheKeckSays	2012-06-08 03:15:09	Fact is, when one guy scores half the points, they should probably win.
22485366	WhatTheKeckSays	2012-06-04 03:33:07	LeBron looked like tim Duncan just then. Sitting on the court confused.
22485366	WhatTheKeckSays	2012-06-04 11:45:41	@terrancem29 got you

22485366	WhatTheKeckSays	2012-06-07 15:47:11	Lebron specifically embodies everything that people hate about pro athletes, Durant is the type of player every fan wants on their team.
