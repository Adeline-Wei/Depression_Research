2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-12 11:02:39	I rly think that our social importance goes like this; the older u r, the more intelligent u r, the more worthwhile ur opinions r.
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-12 11:08:30	Finally decided 2 get ready but now I have 2 come up with a conclusion 2 my essay. 😁 I bad at these!
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-12 11:10:45	Half the time I spend on my phone, I don't do anything. Just wait 4 someone 2 post something I guess.
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-12 11:13:46	There's notifications on Twitter but ios8 is rly playing up so Idk who they're from or what they r. I also need 2 re-install my music app.
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-12 19:12:59	"Don't let 'em say u ain't beautifuuullll, owayohoo. They can all get ******* just stay stay 2 uuuu"
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-12 16:14:18	No matter how many times I watch Friends, the whole Ross and Rachel thing messes with my head.
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-14 15:58:17	Just got a call nd new it was a prank from the first 5 seconds so I replied with "I know this is prank call and I don't rly give one."
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-14 15:58:53	Then I came up with a much better response afterwards. Only thing is, my mum was listening in so I'm glad I didn't say it. 😂
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-15 15:13:57	Done with school.
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-15 15:15:46	Our French teacher is rly funny but he's a rly bad teacher then goes off on one when we don't do any work. Like ffs, we can't concentrate!
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-15 15:17:46	Plus, he barely gives us a chance 2 take notes nd doesn't translate anything 4 us. 2day he told some1 that their work was "complete rubbish"
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-15 15:19:57	But my earphones just saved my phone from hitting the floor!!! 😄😂💕🎧🙌👏
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-15 16:01:50	Som teachers: Ur work is rly bad. Detention! U need 2 concentr8. U shud hav listened!(Now they shud improve)
Kids: U wud hav thought by now…
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-15 16:04:02	Pisses me off that I'm only in yr9 but I already h8 the years 2 come. It's not even as if I'm struggling or anything. Just why?
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-15 16:10:47	We hav 2 pretty much choose r jobs at 13: choices, GCSEs, A-levels, uni, degree, jobs. If they can't let us watch ghost movies, then t this?
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-15 16:16:33	Dear teachers,
Stop trying 2 get us 2 take ur subjects.
Sincerely,
13yr olds who r never going 2 take those subjects anyway.
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-18 13:04:10	I suddenly lost over 100 gems on temple when I saved up. How?
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-18 13:04:54	When u say 'lol' in real life.

2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-18 20:04:23	I'm sorry, but I'm being rly stupid and R advice on telling me that my fear is stupid is actually rly helping.
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-18 20:05:06	Tf tho. My mum knows I hate spiders and she said I was an idiot 2 be scared of the one flying round the bathroom.
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-17 21:27:10	Americans: Omg! I'm so excited for winter!
English: Winter? Do you mean no snow and just colder and even more rain?

2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-18 20:40:25	Someone with their caller ID off tried 2 call me but wouldn't talk when I answered. So if it was youuuuu, then ur creativity is on point.

2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-16 16:19:53	My English teacher is so biased and no matter how well u do, if she doesn't agree with it, she'll say it's bad.
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-21 20:53:54	Benidorm is the best and the accents r just life.

Me: It carries your future.
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-21 05:48:12	We have double tech and set 2day!
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-22 16:16:41	When teachers say that u hav improved a lot since ur last piece of work and ur just like, 'how bad was I?'
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-22 16:22:13	Do not try to change for someone because sooner of later you're not going to know them and will realise how much you have missed out on.

2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-23 15:25:58	I guess I don't like reading much cuz I like 2 imagine my own stories from scratch &amp; can't concentrate on pausing my imagination like that.
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-23 15:48:23	So u don't like me? Please, tell me something Idk.

2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-25 13:21:08	Beautiful Pain is amazing. Yes, I am going 2 say this again but Eminem, Sia and Rihanna would make a great song together.
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-25 13:26:13	They say scorpios r very secretive and although I will say lots I am.♏️
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-10-25 13:35:49	Why don't u just have 'feed me attention' on a cardboard sign round ur neck.

2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-11-01 17:05:38	School would be alright if we didn't have tests, HWK or crappy teachers.
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-11-01 17:08:06	It doesn't really depend on the school u go to, but teachers should be hired on their ability 2 teach other than just how clever they r.
2258116816	txrtlxs	2014-11-01 17:11:33	Our parents need 2 understand that our generation is way different 2 theirs!
