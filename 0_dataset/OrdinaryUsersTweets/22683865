22683865	TDennard	2013-12-18 21:29:31	@Enquirer "Another Plan, Another No." What a shame...
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-18 21:31:39	It's irresponsible to say NO to the #cincystreetcar no matter what and it's irresponsible to say YES no matter what to the streetcar
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-18 21:33:28	I listened to compelling testimony from construction workers about the challenges they would face due to #cincystreetcar cancellation
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-18 21:34:40	@ChrisSeelbach I dunno but I will look at the numbers and what thus said the voters of this city previously #twice #cincystreetcar
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-18 21:36:10	Even #Santa is civically engaged in what is happening in the City of #Cincinnati http://t.co/GAMjAupuUm
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-18 21:52:45	@spacks @davidheyburn I'm going to push back on that a little. I'm a proud Cincinnatian, born and raised, and I love ALL Cincinnatians
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-18 21:54:26	@VotePG My cousin...
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-18 21:57:28	@davidheyburn @spacks Cincy can do better welcoming newer Cincinnatians be clear but it's VERY pessimistic
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-18 23:25:27	The status quo isn't working for everyone. Responsible bidder needs to move forward
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-18 23:27:04	Our city can't do well unless it's a place of opportunity for everyone. Not just a few
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-18 23:39:56	Still in council chambers...#whataday
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-19 01:00:39	JUST left City Hall; now reviewing #cincystreetcar analysis one more time in preparation for the audit review in the morning...#onmygrind
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-17 19:54:18	What motivation does #SORTA have for walking out on this limb?
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-17 19:57:37	Cranley just said @VotePG plan to have a special assessment to put the burden on those that benefit that most won't work #cincystreetcar
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-19 11:48:27	‚Äú@KenndrickLamar: I'd rather watch what a person does than to hear what they have to say.‚Äù All day!!
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-19 18:52:53	Mayor Cranley doesn't agree with the majority of City Council's decision to move forward with the #cincystreetcar
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-19 18:53:45	#Cincinnati is not the city of waste. #cincystreetcar
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-19 18:55:45	Just had a citizen today who wouldn't shake my hand because we have different views. That was strange...
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-19 18:57:28	Mayor Cranley: It's time for Cincinnati to move on...#cincystreetcar
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-19 19:32:22	Councilmember Young gave @JohnCranley props for the speech he gave and said that there folks should be careful not to gloat #cincystreetcar
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-19 19:35:26	Cincinnati is ready to move forward. #cincystreetcar is here; let's work for its success...
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-19 19:48:52	We HAVE to stop pitting safety against progress...there is room for both! The rhetoric has to stop! #cincystreetcar

22683865	TDennard	2014-01-01 16:13:46	@RAJEmom @MuscleMilk I like it! I drink it often but particularly on the days when I really go hard on my muscles or new muscles
22683865	TDennard	2014-01-01 16:14:39	@justcallmeALLEN  @MuscleMilk I think they call it that because of the consistency of the drink
22683865	TDennard	2014-01-01 16:15:12	@Maruader23 @OldSchoolCincy I'm done now. Had to get it in. Start my year off proper
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-30 19:19:08	Hands down 1 of the best feelings ever is approaching someone that isn't smiling and getting them to smile at you because you did it first
22683865	TDennard	2014-01-01 17:08:08	@justcallmeALLEN Happy New Year to you too!! It's been far too long! I hope to see you soon!!
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-30 22:33:19	I'm proud to support @FitzGeraldForOH as Ohio's next governor. #TeamFitzgerald
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-30 22:45:53	@T_GRAG @VotePG I got behind @FitzGeraldForOH vision for Ohio about 7 months ago...that's the benefit of declaring your candidacy early
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-30 22:51:29	@T_GRAG Having money can change that around in a gubernatorial campaign. Unfortunately if he has to go thru a primary, that costs.
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-30 22:52:53	@T_GRAG @VotePG @FitzGeraldForOH BTW, Portune doesnt have name recognition in NE Ohio...so that a zero sum game. The ODP has already back Ed
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-30 23:32:06	@T_GRAG @VotePG @FitzGeraldForOH @JohnKasich That's why you run campaigns
22683865	TDennard	2013-12-30 20:16:03	Does anyone have a connect to get 2 tix to @HorseshoeCincy party tomorrow? @SeanTylerHerron @DJETrayn Anyone?

22683865	TDennard	2013-12-31 03:04:07	Don't forget to actually DO something new so that you can complete the whole #newyearnewme thing...

22683865	TDennard	2014-01-15 19:34:59	Listening to powerful testimony at #CityHall from ppl who were homeless or formerly homeless abt how supportive housing saved their lives
22683865	TDennard	2014-01-15 19:53:24	I truly understand both sides of this issues. However, homelessness doesn't mean you are a criminal. It means you don't have a home.
22683865	TDennard	2014-01-15 20:50:59	@Kitchen452 I adore you ladies!!!

22683865	TDennard	2014-06-11 01:19:09	I'm genuinely scared by #EricCantor's loss...
22683865	TDennard	2014-06-11 01:21:10	#EricCantor thought he was a shoo-in. No substitute for pressing the flesh &amp; makin sure people know you haven't forgotten them. #Politics101
22683865	TDennard	2014-06-11 01:31:02	Hand down! Man down! Love this basketball saying @MarkJackson13 this applies to #EricCantor too!!
22683865	TDennard	2014-06-11 01:32:25	@CarrieNBCNews Politics is a crazy game. But the lesson here is don't get so far in front of the band that you can no longer here the music

22683865	TDennard	2014-06-11 11:26:18	I can't underscore how important it is to believe in yourself even when no one else does.
22683865	TDennard	2014-06-11 11:31:45	Dont care how many times I see her, seeing my @KylaWoodsTV on TV NEVER gets old. Love that woman! Best personality on #Cincinnati TV! PERIOD

22683865	TDennard	2014-06-14 14:29:07	That moment when you realize you would rather listen to #MichaelJackson than Rihanna...I think I'm growing up...a little.
22683865	TDennard	2014-06-14 15:20:24	@TheEagleOTR Ha! Thanks!!
22683865	TDennard	2014-06-14 13:52:17	Love is saying, "I see all of your good qualities and imperfections and saying, I still want you to be a part of my life."

22683865	TDennard	2014-06-23 14:59:04	@ScottDean24 That's cool. What are your thoughts on this deal?
22683865	TDennard	2014-06-23 15:03:59	@ScottDean24 Understanding the impact, is it worth it to you?
22683865	TDennard	2014-06-23 15:05:39	@ScottDean24 Yeah, deals like this arent every day occurences. We just have to be a more competitive relative to our own pockets as a city
22683865	TDennard	2014-06-23 15:07:00	@ScottDean24 Every business can't give us these type of tangible &amp; intangible benefits. But we need to incentivize our smaller businesses.
22683865	TDennard	2014-06-23 15:08:39	@ScottDean24 Attracting workers from these jobs will lend itself to the growth and development to our arts community.
22683865	TDennard	2014-06-23 15:09:41	@ScottDean24 Yes they are. Most people aren't employed by @FortuneMagazine 500 companies. They work for small businesses
22683865	TDennard	2014-06-20 14:39:26	Happy to be with @TammyMutasaWLWT and @RAJEmom at the #MTC Summer Enrichment talking w/ great kids. Love that I friends who love service

22683865	TDennard	2014-06-28 22:27:37	@katiecouric Will the GOP continue to be out of touch with the cultural shifts of the country and if so, what is their recipe for success?
22683865	TDennard	2014-06-28 22:28:58	Excited that @SelfDiploma was in the building at #BiggerThanSneakers. Always disappointed when it's not @DJETrayn

22683865	TDennard	2014-10-05 12:59:15	@autothrowback Yeah I do. He messes up a lot and commentators always give me a pass. Or they don't come down as hard as they do other QBs
22683865	TDennard	2014-10-05 13:09:33	@autothrowback I agree. The amount of air time he gets for what he actually produces is hilarious. Average at best is a good way to put it
22683865	TDennard	2014-10-05 13:12:50	@autothrowback The coverage? Maybe not. But he isn't good and that everything to do with him.
22683865	TDennard	2014-10-05 13:16:15	@autothrowback I think the networks make a habit of making excuses for lots of QB's regardless of the team. It drives me crazy.
22683865	TDennard	2014-10-05 13:17:52	@autothrowback LOL!!! They used to...
22683865	TDennard	2014-10-05 13:27:34	@autothrowback I see it all the time.

22683865	TDennard	2014-11-17 12:33:13	People who want to be successful but are unwilling to put in the required work are untrustworthy.
22683865	TDennard	2014-11-17 20:22:49	I think I want to just go home...

22683865	TDennard	2014-11-20 16:48:12	Being charismatic is a gift and a curse. But I'd rather have it than not...
22683865	TDennard	2014-11-20 16:48:46	It's crazy but sometimes not getting a message is actually getting a message...#payattention

22683865	TDennard	2014-11-28 22:10:25	Watching #FatAlbert with a strange feeling...I loved this cartoon growing up. I learned some cool things but geez I feel some kind of way.

22683865	TDennard	2014-12-07 15:59:35	Love truly is an action word; not simply a feeling...
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-08 10:48:33	@KylaWoodsTV Thank you, Love! You are awesomer!!! Have a great week!!
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-06 07:46:26	I'm just trying to figure out why I pay for a big satellite dish package when I only watch the news and DVR for regular TV...#sillygirl
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-09 13:56:43	@KylaWoodsTV I finally got the chance to meet @Fox19Jessica last night at an event at the @CincyCAC She was just as cool as you said.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-09 14:03:01	We are only blessed so that we can bless other people. It's that simple.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-09 14:04:20	Shout out to @WhatsHotRegina and @CincyCAC for an amazing event last night. The exhibits were incredible and I'm excited about whats to come

22683865	TDennard	2014-12-09 18:03:19	I'm dumb excited about the new @JColeNC album. Been in love since I first heard #WhoDat One of the best new MC's to come along in some time.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-10 19:57:28	You can't take yourself too seriously. One of the best things I've learned to do is laugh at myself.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-10 20:40:44	@geekjames @laurenedoyle That's good to know! Thank you for that information!

22683865	TDennard	2014-12-15 21:33:11	I read this morning that, "If it still hurts, you care..."
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-15 21:35:21	#Cincinnati is an amazing city and I'm so blessed to call it home. But I have to admit that I miss @Cityofatlanta sometimes.

22683865	TDennard	2014-12-16 19:54:24	Had a great time at @ClarkMontessori being a judge for their science fair. @IamCPS and the parents/guardians have a lot to be proud of.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-15 16:10:03	Always be true to yourself.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-15 16:27:31	There is this incredible thing that happens when you realize that who you are and what you are, are enough. No validation needed...
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-15 16:34:50	If u have a chance, please check out the @BusinessCourier this week for my #FortyUnder40 feature story. Fun &amp; thoughtful, if I say so myself

22683865	TDennard	2014-12-15 16:59:28	Let's do something radical like bring out the best in each other.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-15 17:00:46	@JTZIP7 I was thinking about you on my drive home last night. We kid around all the time. All jokes aside, you are going to change the world
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-18 14:42:26	Why do I need ID to get ID? If I had ID, I wouldn't need ID! #TheQuestions #Common #MosDef #TrueBill
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-18 17:25:59	It's inconvenient for the "mainstream" to understand the Black Experience here in America. So they won't. #CINCYTOFERGUSON
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-18 17:37:56	@CHRC I think that's a great start. There HAS to be some intentionality there. There has to be more of a concerted effort. #CINCYTOFERGUSON
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-18 17:39:47	@CHRC Not for the sake of having black &amp; brown faces. But for ppl to get to know each other &amp; build greater understanding. #CINCYTOFERGUSON
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-18 17:40:54	@CHRC My experiences and I are invisible to most white people. They don't have to see me, if they CHOOSE not to...#CINCYTOFERGUSON
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-18 17:49:24	@CHRC Absolutely! Hands down (no pun intended). Truth is a MUST. How else we can truly gauge REAL thoughts and fears? #CINCYTOFERGUSON
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-18 17:31:23	@CHRC No absolutes but for the most part until someone they know is affected, then the understanding won't be there. #CINCYTOFERGUSON
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-18 17:32:40	@CHRC There is a great sense of empathy and I appreciate it. But for so many life is a box of chocolates. #CINCYTOFERGUSON
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-18 17:54:06	@CHRC You mean amplify the #BlackExperience? Or dialoguing opportunities? #CINCYTOFERGUSON
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-18 18:08:23	@CHRC Both is good. Watch the aggressiveness and the tone of the dialogue. If people don't feel like can be honest, conversation is futile.

22683865	TDennard	2014-12-21 05:15:05	My best friend doubles as my idol. I'm SUPER blessed!
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-23 18:24:18	Be kind for the sake of being kind.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-24 11:38:59	I'm going to take advantage of these warm temperatures and get an outdoor run in.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-24 14:03:51	@RAJEmom Well, I wish you lived in the city ALL the time! üòä It's never the same running outdoors without you.

22683865	TDennard	2014-12-24 20:19:32	Great time having brunch today w/ @JTZIP7 @rachel_stump and @RAJEmom at the best restaurant in @OTRCINCY @tasteofbelgium JF is the best!
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-28 05:45:03	So...I'm TOTALLY grossed out by the the Mucus characters in the @Mucinex commercials. #yuck #ick
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-28 15:52:48	@myronrivers @TheLewisBlack Ha!!! That'll teach them to stop calling us nerds! Leadership camp is where it's at! #AmericanYouthFoundation
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-29 03:29:11	2014 has been amazing. I'm ready for 2015!
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-29 03:40:11	@jazzsong It was awesome seeing you! I'm incredibly proud of you and all you are doing. Please let me know how I can be helpful to you.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-29 03:42:05	@jazzsong I would like that. Hit me up with some days/times and I will make it happen.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-29 12:08:25	Workout is done. I'm feeling great and I have almost my entire day ahead of me. #fitforlife #letsmovecincinnati
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-29 15:21:34	Rex Ryan was terrible. I couldn't figure why they kept him around so long...
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-29 15:24:36	Whoever has a problem with @idriselba being cast as #JamesBond should really go in their homes and never come out again...#Ridiculousness
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-29 15:26:59	Let me get this straight? That funny looking dude called President @BarackObama a monkey? Baaawwaahhaahhaaa!!! #hilarity #doesheownamirror
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-29 15:28:16	@JeremyDylan Including HIM! Some of his game times decisions were questionable at best.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-29 15:29:47	@JeremyDylan You never want to see anyone fired but he was given more chances than most. He was a little arrogant and somewhat pompous too..
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-29 15:31:01	@JeremyDylan I agree and I think he will be pretty good at it.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-29 15:34:20	@rachel_stump Ha! Love him! He is a mess!
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-29 16:03:40	Is it spring yet?
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-29 16:31:27	There is something to be said about being consistent...I'm always the same. No one has time to try to figure out moods...
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-29 16:36:24	Being against the actions that killed #EricGarner doesn't mean you are anti-police. Police are great and we need them. Not the bad ones...
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-30 01:53:46	Watching #HappyNewYearCharlieBrown Some things never get old.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-29 18:51:55	@rachel_stump Ha! Yes, but I think we will keep him! @JTZIP7
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-30 12:09:04	When I'm DONE working out, this is what the city looks like...#earlybird #letsmovecincinnati http://t.co/M3bTxJ1Ve4
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-30 15:00:07	Have you ever loved anyone so much that you would do anything for them?
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-30 04:58:29	President @BarackObama is one of the best presidents this country has EVER had. So glad I witnessed his greatness in my lifetime.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-30 05:01:48	I love @jimmyfallon He is freaking hilarious!!
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-30 19:35:19	Proud to accept my Impromptu Award from @PGSittenfeld for Biggest Motivator in 2014. I wanna thank my momma.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-30 19:37:06	@ChrisSeelbach @PGSittenfeld Prayerfully we won't. His love and kudos are enough for me.
22683865	TDennard	2014-12-30 22:00:24	Listening to @JeriTolliver and @Jtrotterbratton on #SisterSpeak on 1230AM #TheBuzz. Jeri said ppl want what they want. Not many selfless ppl
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-03 01:01:22	Game recognizes game.
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-03 01:10:32	One of the best moments for me in 2014 was meeting @MrChuckD He was so cool. It was one of the best days ever! http://t.co/HNKpwvX6h7
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-03 22:58:14	Keep your head to the sky.
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-04 05:21:33	Even though @RAJEmom is 4 hours away, she still got me right. This #sexonthebeach is on #fleek
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-04 08:57:47	Be grateful for what you have.
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-04 09:05:40	Insomnia...
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-06 17:35:58	Saw #SarahPalin on the @TODAYshow...#oyvey I was stunned by her entire presentation. And to think, she was picked to be a heartbeat away...
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-06 17:39:24	@Paul_Franklin @TODAYshow No, we don't agree. However I think both pictures are appalling...
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-06 21:38:48	This #weather is some straight up bull! #Brrrrrrrrrrrrr
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-05 10:54:05	In 2015, I will give my all every day like I did in 2014. I will go about it wiser than I did last year. Growth doesn't require a #newyear
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-05 17:01:24	@JTZIP7 @heidiburgett Those are nasty! I love them!!! I knew they would be though!
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-07 23:15:42	We must be intentional about inclusion. We can't assume people know that we mean them too. Tell them.
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-07 23:16:49	My good days by far outweigh my bad days...
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-08 22:36:40	@JTZIP7 @ShawnOakmann2 I was JUST typing that! Something wrong with you...smh
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-12 15:42:12	Today was the 1st day of training for the @RunFlyingPig It will be my first full marathon and I'm pumped! #fitforlife #strongerthanyesterday

22683865	TDennard	2015-01-16 18:05:01	Hi! I joined @Slidely today. I created two #slidely's and can't get them to play beyond one photo. Can you please help? #frustrated
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-19 02:12:57	Love listening to @DJJDough and @youngsteff2 Good dudes and hella funny @wiznationcincy
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-18 12:38:22	In the gym...#onasunday
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-19 22:45:44	I'm on the 8th day of a 10-Day Green Smoothie Cleanse...let's just say everything looks delicious...#oyvey
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-21 14:26:43	Remember in my hotel room in #Barcelona 2 years ago at 2am local time to hear @BarackObama give his #SOTU live. History won't be lost on me.
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-22 18:41:48	Excited that I work with the next US Senator for the Great State of Ohio @PGSittenfeld #PGSittenfeld is ready to get things done for Ohio
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-23 14:54:04	Sometimes we think we want something but ultimately it was best that we didn't get it. Patience is a virtue.
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-23 02:10:54	@kmichaeljordan PG supports a livable wage increased preferably through federal legislation that is determined by a number of industries.
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-23 02:11:53	@bamaples @PGSittenfeld Me!!! We are looking forward to helping make lives better Ohioans across the state!
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-23 03:57:27	@kmichaeljordan People shouldn't work 40/wk and still can't afford to feed their families. A livable wage is necessary.
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-23 04:05:36	@kmichaeljordan Exactly. It is relative. Thats why a study should be done to determine what it is. Wage needs to be substantiated not random
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-23 11:15:36	@kmichaeljordan 10-15 is a solid range. A federally mandated living wage means that that no employee would make less than what is set
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-23 12:05:48	Just went in on my abs in the gym. I hope I feel this tomorrow. That means I did something right! #fitforlife #strongerthanyesterday
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-23 14:50:11	@kmichaeljordan It is critical for us. We demand that people have a living wage that is at least $10.10/hr.
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-23 14:52:30	@kmichaeljordan But we recognize it should be higher in other places. I can't give an exact amount. NELP shows that it depends on the city.
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-25 20:24:41	@KylaWoodsTV Me too!!!
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-27 15:15:14	@womenforaction It would be my absolute pleasure to do so!
22683865	TDennard	2015-01-27 15:25:47	I'm up for the #gallonchallenge. A gallon of water a day for 7 days straight! I got this @bootcampcincy #fitforlife #strongerthanyesterday

22683865	TDennard	2015-02-01 15:12:49	@RepPaulRyan just acknowledged stagnant middle class wages...however @GOP is fighting increasing minimum wage...#mtp
22683865	TDennard	2015-02-01 15:14:24	We can disagree on some things but the numbers don't lie. Great job #POTUS We are moving in the right direction. #MTP
22683865	TDennard	2015-02-04 13:33:20	I love that @SavannahGuthrie just called @Pharrell her #Boo @TODAYshow
22683865	TDennard	2015-02-01 17:22:16	@OdieMoats @RepPaulRyan @GOP You can't take care of your family on minimum wage. What does Rep. Ryan and GOP plan to do about stagnant wages
22683865	TDennard	2015-02-05 16:28:50	@KylaWoodsTV is that one funny! She just had me in tears!!! #LoveHer
