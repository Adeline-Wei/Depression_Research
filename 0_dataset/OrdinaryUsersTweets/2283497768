2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-16 23:59:02	If the Jets would just hand Chris Ivory the football and keep it out Genos hands they wld have a much better chance of winning games.
#TNF
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-19 19:58:16	Wow.. I'm still in shock of how the game went. I need my Cowboys to put in work for me today
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 21:08:48	@CowboysTalkLine Can't wait to see him on the field for the 1st time!.
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 21:16:07	@Bornagainhogfan he does take to much grief but he has fumbled the ball at least twice in the last 3 games. We def need better QB play.
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 21:17:31	@Bornagainhogfan Brandon couldn't start for any other SEC team. We are gonna have to have a atleast a decent QB to compete
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 21:22:11	@Bornagainhogfan lol you are certainly entitled to your opinion but I doubt highly he could take any of those schools OBs jobs.
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 21:24:40	@Bornagainhogfan yet they all throw at least twice as much and play in more pass orientated offenses and don't have the type backs and line
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 21:25:33	@Bornagainhogfan his best and bout only shot at starting wld be Vandy
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 21:29:25	@Bornagainhogfan lol you obviously don't watch anything but Arkansas football if you think Allen is good QB. Id bet I have fare more fk lol
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 21:31:46	@Bornagainhogfan your just some average fan with a twitter. I actually watch and play football lol I'm not argue the obvious
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 21:39:24	@Bornagainhogfan dude idc lol I know Driskel sucks iv never liked even when he was in the race for the Heisman a couple years ago.
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 21:40:15	@Bornagainhogfan I just know Bradon would not start for ANY other SEC school other than maybe Vandy
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 21:44:09	@Bornagainhogfan I have defended Allen all year but his just not a good SEC caliber QB. I'm sorry if that hurts your feelings
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 21:52:51	@Bornagainhogfan put Allen in offense that actually passes the ball a good amount like A&amp;M or Auburn and c how that stat holds up üòÇ
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 21:58:05	@Bornagainhogfan Receivers don't mean shit if you can't read the field and find the open man lol.. and Allen lacks that ability obviously
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 21:58:29	@Bornagainhogfan well obvious to anyone who actually knows football
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 22:07:56	@southernvillain come on now David don't tell me your a Cowboy hater lol
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 22:10:49	@southernvillain I like the Niners and Harbaugh but the Cowboys have been my team since I was a kid so it's good to see them playing well
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 22:11:28	@southernvillain if the D keeps playing good everyone will have to watch out!. Maybe will see the Niners in the NFC championship lol
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 22:17:25	@southernvillain yeah true but aslong as he is healthy he should be able to do enough to keep the pressure off Romo and make the O great
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 22:19:43	@southernvillain lol more than likely!
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 22:24:06	@southernvillain iv definitely been their lol being a Hog and Cowboys fan. N yeah the Hogs should be good in B. ball this year and my Clips!
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 22:27:05	@southernvillain I'd say we will finish 3rd in the Conference no lower than 4th and perhaps even better than 3rd. Will be in the Tourney
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-21 22:36:05	@southernvillain I think he will have our boys ready to compete!

2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-25 12:07:36	Man I'd love if the Cowboys picked up Mark Ingram before the TD!. We would know how to use him and he wld be a great complimentary back!
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-27 03:43:25	1st thing Mark Ingram says when asked about his performance tonight was "God is good". Nice to see Ingram get a good amount of touches
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-26 22:56:30	I'd like to see Andrew Luck lead a comeback W right now!. Lol will have to just see bout this Colts Defense

2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-28 00:48:34	That was DANGEROUS
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-28 00:51:35	We should be fine just need the Defense to start swarming like they have been. Offense outta be able to put up bout 31
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-28 00:55:25	Harris you truely are a dumbass.

2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-31 05:07:03	Ibaka always plays dirty on Blake cause he can't hold or even contain him

2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-01 17:14:22	The more I watch A&amp;M play the more angry it makes me that we didn't beat them. Maybe there's something special brewing today tho!.
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-31 00:58:14	FSU catches a break on the fumble and gets a TD

2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-01 23:56:08	Another nice stop by the Defense
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 00:04:51	ARKANSAS FOOTBALL!!

#WPS
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 00:23:01	Lets answer by grinding out a TD Drive here!
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 00:39:21	That's what happen when we start trying to let Allen take over a drive.
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 00:46:20	ARKANSAS BALL!. INTERCEPTION BY BROOKS ELLIS!!
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 00:50:25	At least a FG off that huge TO would've been nice.. üòß Keep fighting boys!! üò§
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 01:07:46	This is just my opinion but I think we should've went for It on that 4th down to end the half with so little time left on the clock in State
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 01:11:11	Missed opportunities, questionable penalties, Allen, and a few coaching errors have been the dif. In almost all our loses. Lets learn fromem
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 01:19:59	Tricked em into going for the 4th down lol!. Lets Go Hogs!! Get that O churning
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 01:28:33	Keep on pounding it!!
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 01:30:17	Defiantly can't afford to shot are selves in the foot
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 01:30:58	@Coach_Calhoun32 *shoot
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 01:40:34	If our Offense would step up we'd be in good shape! Definitely isn't the 1st time this year our D has outplayed our O
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 01:47:31	I can't help but wonder how much better we would be with a real SEC caliber QB?? Aslong he can avoid turning it over this game I'll be happy
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 01:48:42	Another false start.
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 01:49:45	Thata Boy Collins!!
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 01:52:11	4th quarter w/ Arkansas in Miss. State territory in a 10-10 game.
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 01:57:10	You have got to be kidding me smh
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 02:05:00	Welp it unfortunately might rest on.. Allens shoulders üòß. Screw it. LETS DO THIS! üêóüò†
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 02:15:53	Great Job boys put it in the endzone now!!
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 02:20:52	I don't think running it on 4th was necessarily a bad call but I disagree with the type of run call
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 02:24:00	That was a pretty obvious play call that we didn't look ready for at all
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 02:26:18	@jmnpb996 @houseofboys84 because we are Arkansas and they are the #1 team in the nation
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 02:37:45	Lol i fucking hate Allen. He proves all my thoughts about him right every game smh. Just not a SEC caliber QB.
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 02:39:10	Really hope Bielema doesn't start Allen next year just because he will be a Senior. His not good enough to win games in the SEC.
#JUSTFACTS
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 02:54:01	I'd rather take a bullet in the leg than have Bradon Allen start anymore games for my Razorbacks
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 03:09:07	Regardless of my disappointment I'm very proud of how far we have come as a team. I think we are 1 good QB from winning consistently.
#WPS
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-31 02:09:07	Lebrons got more TOs than points üòÇ

2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-31 02:31:07	Dyer with his 3rd TD Rush has Louisville back on top of FSU in the 4th
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-31 02:40:59	Good D Cardinals
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-10-31 02:42:47	Time for a little Clippers basketball!!

2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 04:04:00	Our Razorbacks could really use some love after this disheartening loss. Be sure to let them know how proud we are If you get a chance!
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 13:52:24	Weeden will get the start at QB today for the Cowboys

2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 15:31:26	@adriantarheel Denver will still pick up the W
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 17:06:14	I think Bradon Weeden will have a much better game than what people are expecting. I'm thinking 3 TDs n round 250+ yards passing
#GOCOWBOYS
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 17:07:25	@RazorbackWill Most people don't have enough knowledge over football to form intelligent opinions on players

2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 20:30:25	Defense is having to do way to much. Our Offense is way to damn powerful to only have 10 points!!
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 20:35:10	@Coach_Calhoun32 *correction 3!!!
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 20:38:59	My hat is off to the Defense.. but not so much for Bradon and our Offensive Coaches who cld only muster 3 damn points w/ all our weapons!!
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 20:45:29	I wish I could flip to the Clippers game right about now
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2014-11-02 20:47:17	Pathetic performance by the Coaches running the Offense today. I think they deserve as much if not more blame than Weeden

2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-05-01 19:08:37	All @ESPN_Colin is good at is running his mouth about how bunch of stuff he "thinks" he knows about. What kinda analyst can go on that..(1)
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-05-01 19:09:44	@ESPN_Colin type of rant and not even get your facts straight lol what hack.. maybe your as dumb as I guess you think us "southerners" r(2)

2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-05-01 18:51:31	4 all the Respect I have for @Jones_Drew32 him saying Byron Jones was "by far" the worst pick of the 1st Rd is pretty dumb given his upside
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-05-01 18:52:34	@Jones_Drew32 But will c. Thanks for the memories tho Mo Jo
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-04-30 22:20:30	"I think the Milwaukee Buccaneers should draft Winston #1 overall."
-Things people who act like the know about football say
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-04-30 23:59:21	I'll say it 1 more time before the Draft.. Mariota is going to be a better NFL QB than Winston &amp; if the @TBBuccaneers draft Winston 1st..
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-04-30 23:59:35	@TBBuccaneers they will continue to suck
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-05-01 00:05:54	The Draft has begun..
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-05-01 00:12:45	This just in... The Bucs still suck
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-05-01 00:21:55	I think the Titans made the right pick regardless if they actually keep him or not
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-05-01 00:27:00	@NFL_Stats the Jaguars are looking to extend their streak of consecutive top 10 draft picks since '08 lol
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-05-01 00:28:24	Welp iv been right about the 1st 3 picks so far
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-05-01 00:33:33	I think Oakland will probably go Cooper here but i think Willams wld probably be better for their team right now
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-05-01 00:34:03	.. They will still be the Raiders regardless
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-05-01 00:40:01	Finally a pick that wasn't obvious lol
2283497768	Coach_Calhoun32	2015-05-01 01:17:16	That one caught me by surprise
