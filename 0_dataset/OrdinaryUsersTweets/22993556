22993556	robstathem	2009-03-06 03:46:38	@stevegarfield I'd like to know where Jimmy gets his suits! Lookin' sharp!

22993556	robstathem	2009-04-05 17:34:34	@AnnCurry Are you a latte, or cappucino drinker Ann?
22993556	robstathem	2009-04-07 07:28:22	@AnnCurry Ouch Ann! 4:30 AM! That must be hard! But, we're all glad you're reporting news! You're a role model for many women, Ann!
22993556	robstathem	2009-04-07 23:20:11	@AnnCurry What did you think of the video? Good to see him in such good spirits, huh?
22993556	robstathem	2009-03-05 23:11:04	@jimmyfallon 
Jimmy, You ROCK!!! I cannot think of a better replacement! I've been watching you since the days of SNL.
22993556	robstathem	2009-03-07 10:04:07	@jimmyfallon hey jimmy, will you be doing any cooking segments on the show? do you cook?
22993556	robstathem	2009-04-04 00:29:19	@AnnCurry Hi Ann, On the Today Show, I know that you guys are reporting news, but can you share opinions, or is this not allowed on news?
22993556	robstathem	2009-04-04 20:11:09	@AnnCurry Oh boy!  Sorry Ann! Maybe call in the "Spaminator"? HAHA!
22993556	robstathem	2009-04-05 09:07:15	@DianaKrall Ah, wish I would have been there!
22993556	robstathem	2009-04-05 09:10:18	@AnnCurry I think people find comfort in your voice and reporting Ann. At least I do! You're terrific at what you do; keep it up!

22993556	robstathem	2009-04-07 06:47:23	@chriscoyier "CSS is like a box of chocolates! Ya never know what you're gonna get."
22993556	robstathem	2009-04-07 06:50:56	@chriscoyier Ain't that the truth Chris!? It's like SQL or PHP...you can't learn these in a day either. Yet, employers want us to know all!
22993556	robstathem	2009-04-07 06:53:43	@chriscoyier HAHA! I'm dealing with IE 6? Is that possible? LOL!
22993556	robstathem	2009-04-07 07:00:24	I'm all about clean,attractive, user-friendly websites!!! Here's an example of that: http://southcreative.com.au/gold-coast-web-design.html
22993556	robstathem	2009-04-07 07:21:55	@AnnCurry Do you think bad experiences help shape us into better individuals, Ann? I think these can be life long lessons,
22993556	robstathem	2009-04-07 16:53:56	@AnnCurry  Ann, I would like to forget or wipe out the memory of 9/11. Too horrific!!
22993556	robstathem	2009-04-07 17:25:52	@adwwiltshire Yeah, I thought that was sort of over-the-top myself. Kind of silly funny, I suppose. Twitter's the craze it seems.
22993556	robstathem	2009-05-04 06:01:02	I'm building a database and listening to Jamie Cullum--a british GENIUS!!!!! Freakin' awesome!
22993556	robstathem	2009-04-11 19:48:39	@Renee_Olstead Hi Renee, What's your favorite Diana Krall song? Narrow Daylight?
22993556	robstathem	2009-05-04 05:57:29	@BlueMan13 Very cool! Always nice to have a decked out patio! Yeah, I plan for some BBQ fun as well--got a pool & jacuzzi which I never use!
22993556	robstathem	2009-05-04 06:03:46	@AnnCurry Sounds awesome Ann! Where was this? Upstate New York? I want to visit New York in the fall!
22993556	robstathem	2009-06-01 17:05:08	@61pixels Ah, I love the Layers Magazine Tutorials! As a recent college graduate (with degree in web design) this is a site I visit OFTEN!!
22993556	robstathem	2009-06-26 23:56:58	@jimmyfallon sounds like a kinky iphone!
22993556	robstathem	2009-06-26 23:58:56	@AnnCurry Love the morning! Just not at 5 am! ha! Does the today show staff drink espresso to get them through those early mornings?
22993556	robstathem	2009-06-26 23:53:59	@AnnCurry Hi Ann, How did you react to the death of Michael? What influence did he have on your life?
22993556	robstathem	2009-06-30 17:11:25	@AnnCurry Hey Ann, How are you guys handling all the news and coverage of Michael Jackson? Is it becoming overload?
22993556	robstathem	2009-06-30 17:22:48	@AnnCurry Ann, wasn't that plane crash awful!?  Do you get afraid when you fly (thinking about these plane crashes)??
22993556	robstathem	2009-06-30 20:23:55	@AnnCurry Taking any trip to Ashland or Portland Ann? Have you been to the Shakespeare Festival??
22993556	robstathem	2009-07-02 23:03:47	@elliothere HAHA! I love coffee distractions! :)
22993556	robstathem	2009-07-02 23:06:13	@SaraBareilles haha! Was it a walk down the Hollywood walk of fame? Sometimes scary people can emerge! :)
22993556	robstathem	2009-07-02 23:16:54	@jimmyfallon how about those "bromance" novels you suggested on your show? HAHA!
22993556	robstathem	2009-07-02 23:20:09	@AnnCurry Gosh, what a heart wrenching story, huh?! What can we do to make air travel safer? All this talk of plane crashes is scary!
22993556	robstathem	2009-09-14 08:07:49	@AnnCurry Hi Anne, I am an avid listener of your news reportings and think you are a kind, compassionate woman.
22993556	robstathem	2009-09-14 08:09:13	@AnnCurry I'm so sorry...I put an "E" after your name. Forgive my typo! :)
22993556	robstathem	2009-09-14 08:13:42	@alroker Hi Al, you are THE weather Man! I enjoy watching Today and feel at home with ya'll. Please come to Orange County, CA...for a visit.
22993556	robstathem	2009-09-14 08:22:02	@KevinSpacey Amazing how fast the summers go, isn't it?! My summer has been a blast....I am itching to see "Time Traveler's Wife!!"
22993556	robstathem	2009-09-24 17:01:40	@AnnCurry Hi Ann, I last heard the Ashland fire was 85% contained. My heart goes out to those who lost homes. Many thanks for the firemen!
22993556	robstathem	2009-12-14 03:48:53	@JimCarrey Hey Jim, I love your official website! Very very snaaazy! What company built this?

22993556	robstathem	2010-01-08 23:49:13	@BlueMan13 WOW Todd! Your last tweet dates back to May! :) Keep up the tweets! :)
22993556	robstathem	2010-02-09 21:19:24	@JimCarrey Hey Jim, You were GREAT in Majestic! I used to live in Humboldt County! GREAT town, isn't it!? Do you go back to Ferndale?
22993556	robstathem	2010-02-09 21:24:57	@BlakeBoege That's crazy! I saw a line too at Dinneys...right on Alicia Parkway this AM as I was driving to meet a client at Starbucks.
22993556	robstathem	2010-02-09 21:32:15	@AnnCurry I thought it was very cool indeed Ann. Did you also see the Letterman, Leno, and Oprah commercial? What were your thoughts?
22993556	robstathem	2010-02-12 09:39:12	@rocciberrini  I think I'm one of the few people who haven't seen this movie yet! LOL!
22993556	robstathem	2010-02-12 10:44:55	@rocciberrini Hopefully NBC has learned their lesson, right? Couldn't the lesson be: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it?"
22993556	robstathem	2010-02-12 10:46:27	@AnnCurry He's a real trooper, isn't he?!
22993556	robstathem	2010-01-08 23:50:50	Today is AWESOME--I'm going to do some web work for a multimedia company and I have a full-time job interview next week! 2010 is lookin' up!
22993556	robstathem	2010-04-16 02:28:23	@AnnCurry Glad to hear it Ann! I think the last film I saw where everyone was laughing was "Death at a Funeral." Have you seen it?
22993556	robstathem	2010-04-19 00:12:27	enjoying the great Orange County weather!
22993556	robstathem	2010-04-17 05:49:50	@EstherJeles Hi Esther, I really enjoyed your definition of success that you gave on MIPtalk.Success to me is achieving a life-long goal!
22993556	robstathem	2010-04-19 03:01:13	@SaraBareilles haha! Hope your Easter went well Sara! How's the family in Eureka?  Best, Rob from Limited! :)
22993556	robstathem	2010-04-21 06:25:29	@miptalk GREAT question! I'd say my piano teacher---because she's the most positive person and her thinking is that ANYTHING is possible!
22993556	robstathem	2010-04-22 21:49:25	Yosemite = WOW!!
22993556	robstathem	2010-04-27 20:50:50	is crazy about citrus and this orange that I just consumed! I know it didn't come from "Orange County," but it was amazing! :)
22993556	robstathem	2010-04-28 18:38:58	Quick thought for the day: Carpe Diem!
22993556	robstathem	2010-04-27 02:14:41	is hooked on Diana Krall's "Narrow Daylight!" Such a powerful song! Have a listen:

22993556	robstathem	2010-04-27 07:06:51	@alroker Hey Al, Sounds like perfect weather in NY! Have you and the Today Show crew thought about going live in Orange County, CA?
22993556	robstathem	2010-04-29 06:04:17	@hodakotb ahhh, come do the Today show in So. Cal, Hoda! Plentiful sunshine! :)
22993556	robstathem	2010-04-29 05:57:31	@katiecouric What are your reactions to Obama's Health Care Law?
22993556	robstathem	2010-05-04 15:48:10	Isn't it strange as adults that we find things we like that we didn't as kids? For instance, I love organic oatmeal now.
22993556	robstathem	2010-05-06 23:52:53	@mr_gadget hate to be the bearer of bad news: it's Thursday! :-)
22993556	robstathem	2010-05-08 03:21:17	is gearin' up for an awesome weekend of mountain biking off the trials of Orange! What is everyone up to this fine weekend?
22993556	robstathem	2010-06-19 04:25:56	@taylorhutchison No kidding! I love how dogs will sleep sideways...so they end up taking more like 50% of the bed! LOL!
22993556	robstathem	2010-05-14 03:13:45	FACT: Eating tomatoes can help prevent sunburn! See article:
http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37117627/ns/today-today_health/
22993556	robstathem	2010-08-13 19:53:10	It's Friday the 13th! Gearing up for an awesome weekend filled with the great outdoors. Gotta love Orange County weather! :)
22993556	robstathem	2010-08-18 03:04:34	@JaneMonheit Glad the performances in New England were awesome! Do you still get opportunities to perform with Joel Frahm?
22993556	robstathem	2010-06-26 19:46:14	Going Hiking in Trabuco Canyon!
22993556	robstathem	2010-08-08 06:12:00	went to Huntington Beach today with friends....fun times, but INSANE with the US Open! How many of you follow surfing?
22993556	robstathem	2010-05-23 03:52:02	10 hours on I-5 will wipe a person out! LOL! At Least our Lexus got us through the grapevine! :-)
22993556	robstathem	2010-05-24 07:42:48	just saw Arachnophobia directed by Frank Marshall. An older film and so good at scaring the heck out of people. I fear tarantulas! :/
22993556	robstathem	2010-05-27 04:21:38	@carrieanninaba How long do you (as judges) have to comment on the stars' dances? Just curious; thanks! :-)
22993556	robstathem	2010-05-27 21:02:25	@hodakotb missed it! What did you think of the DWTS Season Finale? Who were you rooting for?
22993556	robstathem	2010-05-28 05:08:58	way to go Lakers! Woo-hoo! What a close game, eh?! Who watched tonight?
22993556	robstathem	2010-05-29 21:43:22	@katiecouric Not very hopeful is it for college graduates just out of the gate looking for work? I hope the economy turns around soon!
22993556	robstathem	2010-08-26 23:09:10	@miptalk Raising Hope looks very funny! :) Is this an interview that we can look for as a podcast series?
22993556	robstathem	2010-09-20 04:52:01	@JaneMonheit HAHA!  :-) I was not aware that Ipads came sparkly!? Awesome...I'm not that techno just yet..one day, maybe? LOL!
22993556	robstathem	2010-09-13 05:54:28	Hasn't succumbed to CS5 yet! hehe :) Who's got CS5 and whatcha think?

22993556	robstathem	2010-11-12 06:03:52	@marieosmond Words cannot be said to express my sadness over the loss of your son, but I'm sending love your way! xoxo, Rob
22993556	robstathem	2010-11-12 21:10:31	@carrieanninaba I love the innocent comraderie between you, Bruno, and Len. You guys make me laugh so hard!!! hehe :) Love to you all!

22993556	robstathem	2010-11-14 21:47:59	@marieosmond Wish I were there in person to give you a hug, but I'm sending a virtual hug your way. xoxo, Rob

22993556	robstathem	2010-12-08 19:23:30	@SteveMartinToGo How was the concert at the VanDuzer Theater in Arcata? Humboldt County is my old stomping ground! Hope it was a blast!? :)
22993556	robstathem	2011-01-14 06:32:42	@JaneMonheit I'm playing "Moon River" on the piano--a sweet song, and better to hear you perform it LIVE. Would you kindly offer a critique?
22993556	robstathem	2011-01-14 06:44:26	@hodakotb Hi Hoda, Please bring Kathy with you to Orange County, California, for a 4th hour of Today. Would LOVE that, and so would we all!
22993556	robstathem	2011-01-14 21:02:46	@kathynajimy Thanks for the Hocus Pocus link! Wow, that movie looked very demanding to make! What was the experience like?
22993556	robstathem	2011-01-14 21:08:05	@SaraBareilles TGIF Yeah! Enjoy the day Sara! So nice out here in Orange County. Former humboldt sendin' a shout out! Word! :)

22993556	robstathem	2011-01-17 21:27:46	@JaneMonheit Thank you so much for the response! I'll try and get a sample online so you can listen-no added pressure on your part to listen
22993556	robstathem	2011-01-17 21:28:48	@JaneMonheit P.S. And thank you for recording "Moon River." You and Michael Kanan shined through on that at Catalina's during the new year!
22993556	robstathem	2010-12-30 19:42:29	@JaneMonheit Airports can be such a hassle sometimes! Safe travels to you guys! No snow in LA! LOL!
22993556	robstathem	2010-12-30 19:50:51	@SteveMartinToGo Wow...now it can't get much more romantic then sleeping at an airport, right?! HAHA! ;)
22993556	robstathem	2011-01-30 04:09:06	@AnnCurry Ann--wondering over the course of your years in journalism, what has been the most difficult interview to conduct?
22993556	robstathem	2011-01-30 04:13:50	@carrieanninaba I love the playful/innocent comraderie between you, Len, and Bruno! Always a laugh-out-loud riot! Can't wait for new season.
22993556	robstathem	2011-01-03 06:57:10	@lindsaylohan Hi Lindsay, Sending support and encouragement your way. Things will get better. Here's to new beginnings in 2011.
22993556	robstathem	2011-01-06 19:52:57	@JaneMonheit I really enjoy the duet you do with Peter Eldridge "Around Us." Great, GREAT song! Thank you both for making beautiful music!
22993556	robstathem	2011-01-30 03:52:05	@ConanOBrien Such a great film, isn't it?! Great to see Natalie Portman take home the golden globe. What did you think of the globes?
22993556	robstathem	2011-01-30 04:00:48	@TheBelz GREAT site, Richard! Lots of fun! As an iPhone user myself, I had a lot of fun exploring the site. Thanks for sharing!
 
:) Rob
22993556	robstathem	2011-01-07 21:16:34	@marieosmond I enjoy Chicken/Turkey Pot Pie. It's a hearty meal that's great on winter days! I like to make this dish from scratch! :)
22993556	robstathem	2011-01-07 21:40:39	@KevinSpacey I really enjoy your work and your music! I love it when you perform Bobby Darn hits! I hope there's more good things to come!
22993556	robstathem	2011-01-07 21:47:39	@SaraBareilles Nothing odd about that. Next the gym will be playing Martha Stewart's show while she bakes a cake! Isn't that torture? HAHA!

22993556	robstathem	2011-04-26 23:51:14	@AnnCurry I hope one day soon I can share my story on the Today Show about my unpleasant experience of working with an actor!
22993556	robstathem	2011-04-06 00:23:15	@ERIKAjaneC Who are you rooting for on DWTS? :)
22993556	robstathem	2011-04-06 01:20:36	@AnnCurry Hi Ann, What would you do if you did a favor for someone you admire..and at the end they say: "Thank you and get lost!"? Hurtful!
22993556	robstathem	2011-04-06 07:27:08	@TonyDovolani Hi Tony, sad to see you and Wendy leave! I voted on Monday night for you guys! :(

22993556	robstathem	2011-05-08 19:48:21	@golriz Thanks so much for coming to Saddleback on Friday. "Soul Pancake" is such a GREAT concept and I loved hearing you all talk about it.
22993556	robstathem	2011-05-09 21:54:47	@AnnCurry Hi Ann, So inspired by you! Do you have a site that lets people know about the charities that you belong to? Would LOVE to help!

22993556	robstathem	2011-05-20 05:47:49	OK....so it seems the real benefit of using relative positioning with CSS is to then absolutely position elements within the relative tag?!
22993556	robstathem	2011-05-21 04:55:22	@lampert Hi Scott, Rob here (Rachel's brother/Karen's friend). I'm in need of web advice. Wondering if you might have a few minutes to chat?

22993556	robstathem	2011-06-03 06:55:21	@JaneMonheit Don't you just hate rude people? I built a site for actor, Eric Thal, and he was the rudest client I've ever had. Shocked!

22993556	robstathem	2012-07-05 07:28:52	@MsKathyBates Hi Kathy, I love the irony in Misery, when your character is eating cheetos and coke, and Mr. Sheldon is eating a home meal.
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-05 07:30:12	@MsKathyBates GREAT movie! I'd LOVE to see Misery on the big screen. Any chance it will come back on the big screen?

22993556	robstathem	2012-07-09 08:14:41	@JaneMonheit Highly enjoyed your singing of "Manhattan" from the frank and joe show. Hope that tune makes it on a upcoming album of yours.

22993556	robstathem	2012-07-22 03:57:43	@AnnCurry I do hope change comes from this tragedy. There is something fundamentally wrong that anyone can go online to purchase
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-22 03:58:28	@AnnCurry Ammunition! Heavy hearts for the losses!
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-22 19:42:44	@RitaWilson Rita, I am enjoying your debut album! Love your version of "Love Has No Pride." Sadly I missed your coach house concert here in

22993556	robstathem	2012-07-12 01:10:59	@JodiAppleKay Jodi, I remember your days on NBC and Today! Loved Later Today!
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-14 06:49:36	@CherylBurke I live 5 mins away from your dance studio in Laguna Niguel. There's no excuse why I shouldn't be dancing, right?! LOL!!!!
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-14 02:03:46	@AshleyJudd Ashley, that peanut butter cake of yours (listed on your site) sounds fantastic! Is one slice enough? ha ha ha! :-)
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-14 06:34:17	@joshduhamel josh, highly enjoyed "Life as we know it." SWEET film! Sequel, please! :-)

22993556	robstathem	2012-07-16 05:12:35	@marieosmond Ann Curry. Ask Ann Curry. She's one remarkable journalist!
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-16 20:22:04	@alroker Al, can I hire you to be our BBQ cook at our family So Cal BBQ? hehehe :-) You are master weatherman/BBQ cook!
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-18 01:03:09	@Studio1AJoe LOVE watching Today, everyday!
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-18 19:38:18	@alroker My #petpeeve is when others slurp coffee or soup.
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-19 06:19:31	@JaneMonheit My favorite scary movie is Bram Stroker's Dracula. Isn't Gary Oldman freakin' awesome!?
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-19 08:05:38	@joshduhamel what's your favorite scaaaaary movie?
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-19 08:17:47	@todayshow @SavannahGuthrie my pet peeves are when people slurp their coffee or soup, and those that tail gate other drivers!!
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-19 08:22:34	@tiannahall enjoyed reading your article on BSA. It is disheartening to hear their views against gays/lesbians.
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-19 17:47:55	@KathieLGifford Congrats!!! Such great news on Today. I hope "Scandalous" comes to Los Angeles later this year!

22993556	robstathem	2012-07-26 02:16:30	@marieosmond Hi Marie, You're AWESOME! That's what I have to say' :-)
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-26 23:07:31	Am I the only person addicted to those thin mint cookies that the girl scouts sell? You really can't just have one!! :)
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-26 23:09:24	@AnnCurry Hi Ann, sorry to sound like a broken record--I know I've tweeted you before about this...but wondering what you think about
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-26 23:09:52	@AnnCurry Hi Ann, sorry to sound like a broken record--I know I've tweeted you before about this...but wondering what you think about a
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-26 23:11:14	@AnnCurry website for yourself that allows your audience to send donations to causes of your heart? I know people, myself included, that
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-26 23:12:16	@AnnCurry would open their wallets to help others. I am a designer, and would LOVE to help build said website. If this interests you
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-26 23:13:37	@AnnCurry in the future, maybe I could speak with your personal manager? Thanks for reading.
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-26 23:40:12	@MsKathyBates Hi Kathy, I'm sure everyone says this, but Misery NEVER gets old. There hasn't been (in my opinion) a more thrilling movie!
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-26 23:40:41	@MsKathyBates Thank you! Can you convince Castle Rock to re-release it in Theaters. I want to see it again on the big screen!
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-29 03:15:54	@jontangerine Hi Jon, your in depth tutorial on elastic layouts and "ems" is VERY helpful and you explain it in simple terms; thank you!
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-29 03:16:37	@jontangerine There are some authors that do a poor job of explaining elastic layouts and ems, and honestly, I have a hard time grasping
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-29 03:17:05	@jontangerine these concepts, but not anymore! will be bookmarking this and the ems to pixels conversion table! Thanks again! :)
22993556	robstathem	2012-08-08 14:55:31	@AnnCurry Hi Ann, Have you spent some time at Yosemite Nat'l Park? It's beautiful there! Would love to see you report there and encourage

22993556	robstathem	2012-07-31 19:12:08	@jameswillweb GREAT tutorials on http://t.co/RIEOOYCd. Thank you for your in-depth tutorials. Few authors rarely get into the
22993556	robstathem	2012-07-31 19:14:06	Something I learned today on http://t.co/RIEOOYCd from James Williamson is that the TRUE power of relative positioning (continued)

22993556	robstathem	2012-07-31 19:14:57	comes when you apply absolute positioning to the child elements of the relative parents. Doing so keeps the absolute element in tact with
22993556	robstathem	2012-08-09 22:47:04	@AnnCurry Ann, thanks for inspiring report on Today. As a designer myself, I am inspired by your story today to take more photos! Hugs to U!
22993556	robstathem	2012-08-10 00:03:52	@AshleyJudd I am eagerly awaiting to try your peanut butter cake recipe. I can handle a few more pounds. Hehe :-)
22993556	robstathem	2012-08-04 19:27:04	@AnnCurry Ann, please don't jump out of anymore planes, ok?! That scares me! Ha! :-)
22993556	robstathem	2012-08-04 19:30:02	@AnnCurry Sorry for repost--having twitter problems.

22993556	robstathem	2012-08-14 05:09:09	@AnnCurry Sorry for typo. Should say seeing, not swing. You have a gigantic fan base and are adored by many.

22993556	robstathem	2012-11-30 07:42:54	@davecross Hi Dave, saw your testimonial on the Media Lab website regarding Site Grinder. Being an HTML/CSS coder myself (continued...)
22993556	robstathem	2012-11-30 07:43:52	@davecross I decided to give Site Grinder 3.5 a try! It was awful. The software is buggy, and their customer service is horrendous! (cont'd)
22993556	robstathem	2012-11-30 07:45:38	@davecross I don't know what your experience is with it, but I'd let your viewers be wary of Site Grinder. It is not what it's all (cont'd)
22993556	robstathem	2012-11-30 07:46:07	@davecross cracked out to be. Thank you for letting me share. People are WAY better off hand coding HTML/CSS. It's not that hard! :)
22993556	robstathem	2012-11-30 19:13:31	@OlTubby subway is good, however, I like ToGos, because you can get it To-Go. Ha ha ha...
22993556	robstathem	2012-11-30 19:15:19	I have a little problem with whip cream...an addiction problem to whip cream! Am I alone in this addiction? LOL

22993556	robstathem	2012-12-08 05:43:52	I love the smell of the christmas tree...that pine scent. OK...so I'm weird!! But, it's the scent that brings it all back for me! :)
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-07 02:08:47	Does anyone have a dog that sleeps on their back? Mine does...kinda funny! =)
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-06 00:37:39	@MsKathyBates "Face it Girls, I'm older and I have more insurance!"  HAHAHA!!! You are too funny in Fried Green Tomatoes. Thank you Kathy!

22993556	robstathem	2012-12-06 19:54:33	@JaneMonheit Hi Jane, Is your Xmas single from last year available for purchase online? I seem to recall it was sent to subscribers in email
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-06 19:54:59	@JaneMonheit but unfortunately,  I never got to listen to that one!

Thank you in advance and Merry Xmas to you too! =)
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-13 22:02:29	@NatMCole It's not Christmas unless Nat King Cole and Natalie Cole are playing in your CD player! Love listening to you both! Hugs, Rob
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-14 19:39:59	@JaneMonheit I am feeling the same way! Terribly sad!
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-14 20:31:06	@FatherWizard I know...it's so difficult to comprehend this horrible tragedy! I'm turning off all media coverage!
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-10 06:20:22	@katiecouric I saw Les Mis in San Francisco many years ago! The cast was superb! What's your favorite song? Let me guess! I Dreamed A Dream?

22993556	robstathem	2012-12-10 06:35:47	@brookeburke sorry, I forgot an "e" at the end of your name, my bad!
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-10 06:39:16	@katiecouric I'm all in favor of Ann Curry being a guest on your show, and what about Tom Brokaw??
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-14 21:40:33	@defygravityinoz Such a sad day! Difficult to comprehend!
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-14 22:34:50	@NatMCole I agree, Natalie! Swift action must be taken so that these tragedies never happen again! Sending heartfelt condolences to those
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-14 22:34:55	@NatMCole affected.

22993556	robstathem	2012-12-16 02:14:32	@Rosie Hi Rosie, I'm saddened and ever so FRUSTRATED with the gun violence rate in the U.S. We have GOT to change this! What can we do?!
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-16 02:15:20	@Rosie if we need to mail a letter to our congress leaders, I think we should do that! I'm tired of hearing about children/babies being...
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-16 02:15:50	@Rosie killed. Saddened and upset! Tonight, there was ANOTHER shooting right here in Southern CA:
http://t.co/IOgbwkim
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-16 08:17:05	@Rosie peace, unity, and prayer! Yes! I hope our country also takes swift gun control action. This is VERY disturbing! Rosie, I remember...
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-16 08:19:35	@Rosie your discussion that you had after Columbine on your own show. Tom Selleck came on and argued with you, but I agreed with you! We....
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-16 08:20:31	@Rosie need to change the laws and eliminate evil people getting access to guns! anyway, I'm sorry I'm rambling, I'm just sad and upset!
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-17 05:14:47	@MitziKaptureNow Hi Mitzi, Just wanted to say hi and to thank you for your work! "Silk Stalkings" is one of a kind. How can we check out...

22993556	robstathem	2012-12-17 05:39:27	@KatieRaymond88 I agree Katie! We desperately need new gun law changes, but we've got to start treating people the way we want to be treated
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-16 19:52:07	@Rosie @SignOn Thank you, Rosie! I am going to sign this and pass it on to every family member and friends to sign, too!
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-16 21:10:42	@scottiscool I know...the gun violence rate in the U.S. is disheartening!! How many more!? I wonder what the NRA has to say about all this?
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-16 21:13:23	@Oprah The gun violence rate in the U.S. is disheartening! We NEED change, and right now!
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-17 01:51:26	@MsKathyBates Hi Kathy--I'm mixing some spam with my meatloaf dinner tonight. I call it, "Annie Wilkes Meatloaf."  hahahahaha!!!  =)
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-17 02:02:44	@trishapaytas Hi Trisha, Where were you when you heard the news of the Connecticut shooting? I still am in shock! Enough already with...
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-17 02:02:56	@trishapaytas gun violence! ugh....Change is needed!
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-17 05:32:27	@AnnCurry I am in FULL agreement with President Obama! This has GOT to stop. There have been other threats since Newtown on Friday...
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-20 02:46:35	@JaneMonheit Sweet! One of my favorite songs to hear you guys perform LIVE is "Embraceable You." Do you guys still play that one?
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-20 02:49:39	This holiday spread some kindness to others! Make it count! :)
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-23 05:08:21	@Rosie Hi Rosie, Our country has a sickening obsession with guns!! I'm glad the country is having a serious discussion about this now....
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-23 05:09:14	@Rosie but why not over ten years ago after Columbine? We need to ban assault weapons for good!
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-24 00:53:55	@piersmorgan Hi Piers, I am just as frustrated with the gun violence rates in the U.S. Your voice is important and I thank you...
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-24 00:54:13	@piersmorgan for being a voice for change.
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-24 03:44:59	@piersmorgan  please stay! You are a voice for change for so MANY people (including myself) who think the same way you do about gun violence
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-26 07:20:15	@Rosie hi Rosie, why are people wanting to deport Piers Morgan? He has a right to his opinion, and by the way,I COMPLETELY agree with Piers!
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-26 07:22:03	@marieosmond I am so disgusted with the NRA's response, aren't you Marie? We've got to resolve the gun violence problem in the U.S.
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-26 07:05:54	@piersmorgan Hi Piers, I also felt Mr. Pratt laughing at you disturbing and uncalled for! That's basically a slap to the country and these..
22993556	robstathem	2012-12-26 07:08:41	@piersmorgan families who lost loved ones. I don't understand these people and why they are obsessed with guns?! I'm in full agreement..

22993556	robstathem	2013-01-11 04:05:34	@JaneMonheit Soup is like comfort food. My mom always made chicken noodle soup for me and my sis when we got colds. I think it works!?
22993556	robstathem	2013-01-11 04:08:38	@IamLaceyChabert This is true! The paths are different, but having a life goal is common for everyone.
22993556	robstathem	2013-01-15 18:19:54	@GayleKing Thoroughly enjoyed the road adventure you did with Oprah to Yosemite. Fun show! Went to Yosemite in May 2011. Had a GREAT time!
22993556	robstathem	2013-01-17 02:34:36	@LeDoctor Hello Frank, I share something in common with your wife--I was born in Redding, CA. My parents also know Kathleen's parents.
22993556	robstathem	2013-01-17 02:35:36	@LeDoctor What a small world! At any rate, congrats to you and Kathleen for your SUPERB work! Anxious to see Lincoln. Cheers! =)
22993556	robstathem	2013-01-17 07:01:53	@piersmorgan Hi Piers, I watched your debate with Alex Jones. That guy didn't let you get a word in edge wise. Unbelievable! (continued)
22993556	robstathem	2013-01-17 07:03:00	@piersmorgan was Alex trying to create huge controversy with his temper? Good grief. By the way, I agree with you completely on gun control.
