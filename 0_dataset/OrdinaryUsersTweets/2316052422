2316052422	bbauer31	2014-03-22 02:30:25	@MayesAlex3 he's leaving after this year though haha.
2316052422	bbauer31	2014-03-23 17:06:50	@Thacolbsterr they can't stretch the floor on our length. Any top 30 team could go 35-0 with there schedule. It's AWFUL
2316052422	bbauer31	2014-03-23 17:07:46	@Thacolbsterr hahaha alright
2316052422	bbauer31	2014-03-23 17:16:58	Wichita state played 3 NCAA tournament teams this year... Haha
2316052422	bbauer31	2014-03-23 19:23:20	ALL DAY
2316052422	bbauer31	2014-03-23 19:38:01	How's that not a foul?
2316052422	bbauer31	2014-03-23 20:27:03	And no one talks about randle dunk lol
2316052422	bbauer31	2014-03-23 23:56:16	Honestly I've never been more proud of a UK team. Like Calipari said. They ranked us #1 to tear us down. But we're back. Louisville's next!
2316052422	bbauer31	2014-03-24 00:22:08	@bradbrad45 @HGrab02 I might be leaving for spring break on Friday. I'll check

2316052422	bbauer31	2014-03-22 17:51:40	@M_H_S_7 not stat wise. But that's not why I hate him
2316052422	bbauer31	2014-03-22 17:54:42	@M_H_S_7 he's just a punk. I don't like him but I like everybody else
2316052422	bbauer31	2014-03-23 17:04:44	@Thacolbsterr but also consider they play no one and there tallest player is 6'9
2316052422	bbauer31	2014-03-23 19:19:22	If they hit 3s we will lose. Protect that we're fine
2316052422	bbauer31	2014-03-23 19:48:58	These refs are a damn joke

2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-07 02:57:58	@rileyfitz22 funny thing is we've killed almost every team and if ole miss shot like that they could've beat duke

2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-09 17:47:06	@_Big_Daddy_21 yeah, UK has so many young RB but he would help
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-09 18:29:24	Harris would've helped but we have plenty of good young RB.

2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-09 18:57:55	More reason for people in kentucky  to bandwagon bama
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-10 17:29:35	Big day of college basketball. #BBN #GoIrish

2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-10 21:45:44	Proud of this team winning without Karl and willie in OT. Gotta pick it up tho
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-10 22:21:04	Someone text me on this 7 hour ride home üò¥
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-10 22:53:21	Let's give UVA there first loss of the year . GO IRISH
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-11 21:22:10	@JR_kell pretty generous for hoping they score 3 points
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-11 21:44:26	Hope Denver wins it this year. Peyton deserves another ring
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-12 19:34:55	@MauriceDC24 the 3 walk on's in the bottom right corner?üòÇ
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-12 00:57:55	Crazy to think... That might've been the last game we ever see Peyton Manning play
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-11 20:09:27	Who can stop Trevor Lacy on Duke?
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-11 20:10:58	Jahlil okafor is a great player. But plays no defense and all duke does is give it to him. To predictable
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-11 20:14:14	@Thacolbsterr exactly, and tell Marcus Paige he made my day yesterday
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-11 20:23:17	@lcguru23 but he's honestly not a good defender
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-11 20:59:38	Karma for the cowboys
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-11 21:09:23	Nothin better than a former UK player finishing off the Cowboys
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-13 00:20:47	Wouldn't surprise me to see either team win tonight. I think Marcus Mariota will be the X factor in this game. 31-20 Oregon
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-13 01:09:56	Unless u have some kind of connection with Oregon its cool, but blows my mind how many "oregon" fans there are.. üê∏‚òïÔ∏è http://t.co/LN441j7O6O
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-13 01:12:18	@RidgeMac14 I geek when people give that as a reason they like themüòÇ
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-13 05:11:25	OSU proved evryone wrong. No denying it. But the SEC can go Into every season confident 1 of there teams will win it, I feel tht way nxt yr.
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-13 05:14:35	@NHibbard_23 hope we can get there sometime, lol
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-01-13 05:19:04	@_ScHoolBoyC_ yeah I BET!!!!! liked both teams basically since I was born

2316052422	bbauer31	2015-02-11 01:16:08	Willie Cauley Stein brings so much to this team. Stats may not show it always, but he's such an energy factor
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-02-11 01:20:58	Cauley Stein is a 7'0 PG

2316052422	bbauer31	2015-02-11 22:14:52	Kid bringing a gun to school isn't a joke... Scary to think about what could've happened. Glad nothing happened
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-02-11 04:04:47	People will hate on UK regardless. Idiots consider us overrated, unless we beat every team by 50

2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-05 23:03:11	@shabash99 it doesn't but it happens. We had a target on our back cause we were unbeaten. We'll be back next year like usual
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-05 23:16:02	@rileyfitz22 nah we'll beat the Red Sox
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-05 23:20:42	@LukeFlo11 I like all UK Athletics . But yeah dude this one hurt
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-05 18:02:31	@Reds opening day tomorrow!
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-04 22:38:16	@taylor_hart1 they didn't, but they've improved recently
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-06 11:36:15	Happy birthday bro love you man @SpaldingBlake
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-06 11:36:46	I'm not gonna feel like doing anything for about a month
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-06 13:59:44	Wearin vcu today to get my mind off Kentucky.. Still destroyed off the loss
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-07 23:29:00	Lookin for a job...
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-07 23:31:03	@c_webb18 no I'm already score keepin up there I mean a permanent job
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-08 16:24:56	Louisville is gonna struggle bad next year
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-08 18:45:22	Confused why the Harrison twins left but aye go ahead. Thanks for 2 great years
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-06 22:20:45	@SoloUnaMeta alright boy. Can't wait to play em next year
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-06 22:24:36	@SoloUnaMeta it was on the road we were up 13. And your crazy. We have the # 1 C coming in dakari is stayin and so is lee. We'll sign 1-2mor
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-06 23:30:13	And this one belongs to the Reds
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-08 22:38:40	Love dakari, but he needed to stay. Got worse from freshman year to sophomore year. But best of luck in the NBA
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-07 01:46:34	Praying for you, love you man @BigThurmond
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-07 03:16:02	That's an obvious missed call.
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-07 03:21:09	These officials have been awful all tournament. Just can't miss calls that change a game that much
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-07 03:30:07	Enjoy it while it last duke
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-07 03:34:46	Hope the UK players thinking about leaving watched that game. Easily could've been us. Come back for one more year
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-07 04:17:53	Some people take more pride in the conference there teams in than there actual team lol
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-07 04:38:09	This has been worst sports year ever for me. Which means something good will happen soon...
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-07 04:39:47	@JohnDavis_25 lol not realistic rn, I was thinking BBN brings home 9 next season?
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-07 04:40:31	@nickgiancola7 no just the way it ended and who ended up winning. Not a bad season at all
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-07 16:14:04	@WKirk_ never mind i just looked at it. That's pretty accurate
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-07 16:28:01	@WKirk_ that's the one I saw. I like that one, not just cause UK is one either it's just pretty accurate
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-07 17:01:06	If UK won it all. Vegas would've lost close to 7 billion dollars.No way anyone going undefeated if that's the case.NCAA won't let it happen
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-09 21:52:29	Nothing like a sweep to start out the season #Reds
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-10 12:20:59	Happy birthday man @WKirk_
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-10 13:14:55	@MauriceDC24 study guide online was nothing like the actual test lol
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-10 13:47:37	RIP #LaurenHill , inspired many
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-11 01:35:56	The Cuban Missile! #Chapman
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-11 01:37:52	Congrats on declaring, always a part of the BBN @55Harrow
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-09 14:19:31	Ulis,Lee,Poythress,Briscoe,Matthews, Willis, Labbiesiere, probably Newman, Brown, and Zimmerman. I'll take that any day
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-09 15:54:07	"@AmirSimmonz: The Reds are 2-0 life's good"
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-11 14:01:12	Need a new start
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-12 21:16:04	I hate the cardinals, but they seem to own us every single year
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-09 18:41:12	One thing about kentucky is we reload every year. Will be another great year next year
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-09 18:48:16	If I was in that situation I would have to win a championship or be a top 10 pick to leave.... But at the end of the day it's about money
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-09 18:53:49	UK fans need to chill out. Calipari is best recruiter of all time. Let him do his work
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-09 19:13:59	@_RyanSpringer exactly what I said
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-14 03:11:22	The Reds always disappoint
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-14 13:30:49	Happy birthday kasey, miss ya! @kaseysprague
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-15 02:21:33	Kevin Gregg has given up a 2 Run HR every time he's been in. Ridiculous
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-16 02:56:31	Lost so many people I was close with a few years ago it's crazy
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-16 13:52:54	My permit picture is comedy
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-17 16:34:07	@Moemoberly51 he is but you act like bud Dupree is garbage?
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-17 16:37:07	@Moemoberly51 don't hate on my boy bud. Both will be good in the league tho
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-17 11:59:05	Steven Zimmerman is the next Anthony Bennett but worse
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-21 02:16:04	Joakim Noah doesn't get enough credit. Does all the little things that make the Bulls much better
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-21 02:19:09	@ClutchCam4 I know but got to give credit when it's due.
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-20 13:19:20	Happy birthday Cora! @coraharter http://t.co/pj2mRT3BDo

2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-21 00:51:04	COZART WITH DA BOMB
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-22 00:13:49	Titans vs Bucs first game of the year... Could be Winston vs Mariota
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-23 02:43:55	Not another closer in the MLB I could be more confident with closing out a game than Aroldis
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-22 16:26:21	Happy birthday man! Miss ballIn with you at SL @kcox_05

2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-24 17:17:27	Most of these kids are selfish tho. Will Go places where they put up great stats. And he'll be only player on MSU so he fits perfectly
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-24 18:05:07	Welcome to the Titans #TitanUp @hakeemnicks
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-25 02:53:33	We need to cut badenhop and Gregg. Horrible
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-25 02:53:53	Someone come over. Anyone
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-25 03:26:44	@hannspill3 I'm down

2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-25 20:26:03	@eliday14 @c_webb18 I honestly don't think there are any fish in that pond. Kept getting played man
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-27 23:34:57	Jay Bruce needed that one
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-28 14:04:21	Happy birthday bud @ryanjoe49
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-28 19:19:20	These extra 30 minutes haven't made a difference to me.

2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-27 13:40:40	@Moemoberly51 yessir
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-29 01:36:00	Honestly hope Pacquiao sleeps Floyd
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-29 16:48:20	TAKE THE OFFER https://t.co/vEy1jv81OL
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-04-30 15:43:49	Draft day. Marcus Mariota? #TitanUp
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-05-01 23:33:17	@HGrab02 works out for both teams
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-05-01 23:48:33	Great pick for us, might've been top WR if he wasnt kicked out of school
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-05-02 02:29:22	UK will still be solid. Good roster
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-05-01 00:03:05	Let's see what we do with this #2 picküòè
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-05-01 00:18:53	Jon gruden Said this will be best night for Titans fan since we drafted McNair. Strong words! #TitanUp
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-05-01 00:22:02	Good day to be a Titans fan
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-05-01 00:25:25	@shabash99 yeah we do. Mettenberger isn't bad but he's probably not our future
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-05-01 00:27:30	People that study the game like Mariota usually end up being good NFL QBs
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-05-01 00:37:29	@shabash99 our defensive line is really good after free agency. Not a must need
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-05-01 01:00:51	@ClutchCam4 @BleacherReport hell yeah!
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-05-05 16:24:52	Joe is truly an inspiration

2316052422	bbauer31	2015-06-05 04:41:58	Cavs will win multiple championships while Lebron is there but makes it tough with no Kyrie Irving this year

2316052422	bbauer31	2015-06-08 03:17:33	LOL CURRY 5-23
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-06-08 03:19:20	Warriors are in trouble. Curry can be stopped with poor shooting like the past 2 games. Lebron is physically unstoppable
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-06-08 05:23:52	@JR_kell Lebron doesn't have to shoot well to do well. He's physically dominate. If Stephen isn't hitting he isn't effective.
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-06-08 05:26:14	@JR_kell they did bad game 1 tho to. All I'm saying is Lebron is unstoppable steph is not. Lebron is effective even if he shoots bad
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-06-08 05:27:53	@JR_kell never said they'd win it. But curry better start ballin. Cause Lebron is more determined than ever. 5-23 won't cut it
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-06-09 23:43:33	Cozart deserves to be an All-Star no doubt
2316052422	bbauer31	2015-06-10 00:35:27	Reds are finally playin some ball
