2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-22 00:49:48	@NRA @NRAILA  It's obvious @everytown is not for gun safety. Law abiding do not shoot @ cops, rob or steal. Why not target the criminals??
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-20 23:11:07	@gretawire Using this as excuse to loot and steal. disgraceful. Nobody cares that brown pushed the store clerk. They just want to riot.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-20 23:37:46	@gretawire Anyone who goes into a war zone to document a story so we know whats going on, is a true hero. My prayers go to his family.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-22 19:54:04	@CuomoWatch @phil_oliva @RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo How could he even praise a law where law abiding can be charged under it &amp; not the criminal
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-22 20:11:43	@FenwayFerrusi @RobAstorino @CuomoWatch  Yea he seems like a good guy. Look forward to seeing him when he makes rounds in Nassau.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-22 02:21:34	@Eminem Awesome, Is that for sale??
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-22 02:53:28	@seemakalia @maslowsneeds @CuomoWatch Why is it the corrupt politicians prevail or get a pass? Holder, Obama,Sebelius, Clinton, Rice. Rangel
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-22 03:49:38	@TheRealJohnSeal @CuomoWatch @TeamCavuto My son was still in HS when CC started. I don't think it prepared him for college any better.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-23 01:03:51	I Support the Federal Investigation of Gov. Cuomo http://t.co/XGIVmk81zs
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-23 01:09:54	@RobAstorino So many empty stores since Sandy. NY Rising failing to bring businesses back and people back home. My case manager is AWOL, sad
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-23 01:22:55	@CuomoWatch @RobAstorino  Another priority that @NYGovCuomo  has failed at is seeing why NY RISING case managers are so behind in helping us
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-23 01:25:04	@CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo  I have been calling and emailing them and they ignore you. Homes still vacant in Nassau. A big Shame!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-23 01:37:05	@seemakalia @CuomoWatch @phil_oliva Like I said, people like Bloomberg and Andy don't back down. They keep coming until they are shut down
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-23 20:07:37	@FixFloodNow @StopFemaNow Post Sandy, @femaregion2  re rated my home from a 1 story to a 2 because of 3 ft crawl space with dirt. Such fraud
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-23 20:15:38	@CuomoWatch I figured out who is applauding him. Parolees, gang members, violent felons.  Disarming us for his potential voters in stripes
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-23 21:24:02	@RobAstorino @SheriffMoss @CuomoWatch Our leaders are spineless. They never declare war on criminals. Only cops &amp; legal gun owners. Disgrace
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-23 21:26:51	@RobAstorino @SheriffMoss @CuomoWatch   In 4 years, @NYGovCuomo  only feels strongly about declaring war on law abiding citizens. A Bully!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-25 14:26:21	@CuomoWatch @nypost Can @NYGovCuomo really look @ us in the face with a straight face about record. Lets start w/ failed #NY SAFE ACT. SAD!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-23 22:51:33	@SteveMcNY @NYSAFE @RobAstorino In my district, Schumer, Gillibrand, Mccarthy, Skelos and Weisenberg  have never defended gun rights ever!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-23 23:30:20	@femaregion2 Did I miss something???  15 sec video?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-25 12:53:54	@NRA @NRAILA  Chances are they will be using those guns to shoot a criminal. Not a law abiding gun owner. @MikeBloomberg  leads false info
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-25 20:46:05	@Mostofsky @RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo @wfbor @CuomoWatch  NY has become a vampire state. Taxes suck our blood dry. 8.625% is killing me slowly
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-25 20:50:17	@Mostofsky @RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo @wfbor @CuomoWatch  After Sandy, Hme Dep, Lowes, PCRich, no tax breaks.Cost me a fortune replacing items
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-25 20:52:17	@Mostofsky @RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo @wfbor @CuomoWatch NO tax breaks for Sandy victims. 8.625% on every new item. NY Rising is useless
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-25 20:55:46	@JonKaiman Are you running NY Rising? Why is progress so slow??
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-25 20:58:36	@CuomoWatch  @NYGovCuomo @NYGovAstorino @JonKaiman  Why are NY Rising case managers not following up with victims?? Who is in charge of this
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-25 21:02:27	@NRA__LaPierre Is there any one monitoring this account? Why is an NRA member finding such difficulty contacting HQ or Mr. LaPierre??
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-23 16:27:21	@ksbans1 @CuomoWatch @GunSenseUSA @gzornick @IngrahamAngle True, scary to them but easy to use and no recoil.  Let them try a 12 gauge slug
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-23 16:37:00	@NRA @NRAILA  Always a great story when an innocent law abiding citizen prevails against a criminal who doesn't follow laws. Good for her.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-28 02:19:40	@FixFloodNow @stopfemanow @femaregion2 Flood cert was in my favor but NFIP didn't want to budge.A crooked organization that steals from you
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-28 02:29:26	@CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @zephyrteachout @NYGovCuomo Sandy victims are relying on NY Rising but this state program is not doing its job!!

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-29 20:48:33	@NYSRPA @zephyrteachout @RobAstorino  a family of hunters but agrees with violating the 2A and hurting law abiding citizens. Not good!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-30 00:03:14	@NYSAFE @zephyrteachout @Credico2014 @RobAstorino #NY SAFE ACT a big issue. A family of hunters but wants to deny law abiding their 2A. Sad
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-30 13:53:00	@NYSAFE @CuomoWatch As much as we all want a debate, @NYGovCuomo would just be lying to all of our faces. A bully will do what he does best
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-08-30 14:02:49	@CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @zephyrteachout Rob seems to be the only candidate who believes the #NY SAFE act bullies the law abiding gun owner
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-01 04:29:04	@CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @zephyrteachout Went to ST Fair Sat, Left my gun home in Nassau. Cant carry W/ restrictions. Vote Rob 4 2A Rights
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-01 04:36:31	@CuomoWatch @RobAstorino It appears that @zephyrteachout agrees w/ #NY SAFE ACT &amp; won't repeal. NY needs to move forward. Not back. VOTE ROB

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-01 16:46:41	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE Everyone should be writing and calling Maj Leader Sen Reid and tell him to allow bill, S 2363 to be brought for a vote

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-01 05:16:26	@CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @NYSAFE #NY SAFE ACT permits criminals to carry in NY for self defense. Only PA allows me with a NR LTC. VOTE ROB!!

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-01 05:38:55	@CuomoWatch @PeterKauffmann @jmzzz @NYAGV1 @RobAstorino No Prob. Have dealt with Section 8 for my son so I know the truth and hate ignorance
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-01 05:41:23	@PeterKauffmann @CuomoWatch @jmzzz @NYAGV1 @RobAstorino I was also an NRA RSO for the team. Kids learned disciple, respect and confidence.

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-02 11:38:09	@NYSAFE #NY SAFE ACT, CALL AND WRITE SEN. HARRY REID AND ASK WHY HE PREVENTED BILL S. 2363 FROM COMING TO A VOTE. NATIONAL RECIPROCITY

Thanks
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-02 15:56:06	@CuomoWatch @JonKaiman @RobAstorino Who is running NY Rising?? Still ignored by case manager. I guess @NYGovCuomo  is too busy campaigning.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-03 12:13:55	@NYSRPA @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @zephyrteachout  I THINK VOTERS WANT TO KNOW, WHO WILL REPEAL UNSAFE ACT AS GOVERNOR. PLAIN AND SIMPLE. WHO
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-03 12:21:16	@RobAstorino @CuomoWatch @NYGovCuomo I KNOW THAT AFTER SANDY, SMALL BUSINESSES  STILL STRUGGLING AND STILL EMPTY STOREFRONTS. DISGRACEFUL!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-03 23:24:11	@Palinspired @KieranLalor @RobAstorino He is so wrong for NY. His policies and ideas are so draconian. NY needs a fresh start and new ideas.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-04 02:37:26	@KieranLalor @Palinspired @RobAstorino 4 years of lies and dishonesty and ideological ideas that are extinct and NYers suffer due to it.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-02 18:39:06	@truTVjokers @RealNugget1 @truTV  You guys are the Best. Waiting for you to tour on Long Island. When stressed, you are the cure.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-02 15:11:09	@LizHortonABC11 @truTVjokers @BigweatherABC11 One of the best shows on TV. Youtube some of the older seasons. Would love to see them live.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-04 16:34:46	@GunOwners @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino This is why @NYGovCuomo has failed NY by failing to go after criminals &amp; bullying law abiding citizens!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-04 16:40:31	@RobAstorino @CuomoWatch Maybe that's why @JonKaiman &amp; @NYGovCuomo  have been AWOL from NY Rising. Leaving SANDY victims to struggle &amp; fall.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-04 16:42:52	@astorinorising @TheRevAl @CNN @FoxNews I am quite sure @NYGovCuomo  does not care and will not take fault in his failed and useless law.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-04 16:45:10	@RobAstorino @CuomoWatch  @NYGovCuomo Does anyone actually know @JonKaiman ? Ask him if his twitter account is working. Where is NY Rising?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-04 16:51:03	@NRA @NRAILA Not allowed in Nassau County to protect myself. I can only defend myself @ the range. NCPD would rather me be a victim. So Sad!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-04 16:52:32	@NRA @NRAILA  In Nassau County, only the criminals are allowed to lawfully carry firearms!!!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-04 16:55:01	@NewYorkGOP @RobAstorino When @NYGovCuomo  changed the retirement tiers, he forced us to stay in NY longer. 40+ yrs on any job a sentence!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-04 16:57:49	@NewYorkGOP @RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo NYC is 25 year retirement. I have to work 34 yrs before I am eligible under tier 4. Cant go to PA yet!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-03 16:02:41	@NRA @NRAILA  Awesome job. Some of our Long Island leaders probably wish the homeowner was killed. A law abiding finally prevails. Awesome!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-03 16:15:58	@DanielleBesley @nysafeact Our tax dollars being wasted by @NYGovCuomo . Harassing law abiding instead of criminals. VOTE @RobAstorino
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-03 23:17:18	@astorinorising I do not think I have heard from or seen @Credico2014 at all. Don't even know him or his views on the 2A.  Need solid views.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-02 18:44:03	@astorinorising @CuomoWatch @NYSAFE Just remember, @NYGovCuomo  said we would all forgot about the #NY SAFE ACT.  Who made NY UNSAFE? Guess
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-04 20:51:11	@RobAstorino @nypost My tax dollars being wasted on enforcing the #NY SAFE ACT and harassing law abiding and ignoring real criminals. SHAME
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-04 21:12:40	@astorinorising @TheRevAl  Enforcing a law like the #NY SAFE ACT proves that the killing of a cop by a known criminal is less significant.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-04 21:40:54	@astorinorising Criminals love to target gun free zones. All of the good guys are disarmed for their convenience. Criminals applaud SAFE ACT
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-04 21:45:15	@CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @zephyrteachout  I think a real debate would be @NYGovCuomo debating the constituents. He wouldn't last 5 minutes
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-04 21:48:47	@astorinorising @zephyrteachout  Only @RobAstorino has publicly announced he would repeal the SAFE ACT. Write a law that targets criminals!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-05 11:30:27	@NYSRPA What do you expect. He never was a crime fighter. Only harassed law abiding. He lost all credibility. states cant stand him.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-05 11:35:13	@NYSRPA Thanks @MikeBloomberg. Thanks for trying to disarm the good guy. Go spend your money on a large 60 oz slurpy and leave us all alone.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-05 00:34:01	@helensmomma @SheriffMoss Tax dollars being wasted enforcing #NY SAFE ACT when felons are killing cops. Criminals applaud the SAFE ACT. SAD!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-05 00:35:42	@astorinorising @NYGovCuomo You mean Shelly not retired yet? I thought he wore out his welcome years ago.Where are the term limits???

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-05 01:36:12	@helensmomma @iamblwild @SheriffMoss @RobAstorino Yes, It is apparent that @zephyrteachout will continue the ambush on LAW ABIDING
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-05 01:47:30	@ggreenberg27 PASS THE WORD,VOTE FOR ROB ASTORINO AND MOSS FOR LT GOV.

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-05 02:45:04	@gretawire Why do other countries refuse someone a uturn if there was a mistake? They must hate and laugh at us for all our political drama.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-05 02:49:55	@helensmomma @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @zephyrteachout  I agree but @NYGovCuomo does not, He would rather target law abiding gun owners.

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-05 03:04:56	@helensmomma @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @zephyrteachout @NYGovCuomo I do think she lost gun owner votes by agreeing with #NY SAFE ACT. Mistake
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-05 19:15:47	@GWR @Eminem Monster tour@ METLIFE was awesome. Em always working on something. He deserves the recognition. Best in his class.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-05 19:19:05	@News12LI  A great thing of course but too bad my taxes will give him free meals, healthcare, dental, legal, schooling, etc. EXECUTION???
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-05 19:21:25	@astorinorising @k9dobny I was asking same thing. Did @NYGovCuomo  make a statement? does he care? #NY SAFE ACT targets law abiding only!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-05 19:23:08	@astorinorising @k9dobny  Not a childish statement at all. @NYGovAstorino passes a useless law in the midnight hours to prevent this crime.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-05 19:26:37	@astorinorising @k9dobny The failed #NY SAFE ACT did not prevent a felon from killing a cop. Only prevents a law abiding from carrying 10 rd
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-05 19:27:57	@astorinorising @k9dobny @NYGovAstorino MISTAKE, I MEANT @NYGovCuomo  PASSED A USELESS LAW
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-07 18:07:48	@astorinorising He is very arrogant. He is too confident. Instead of running NY, He is running his campaign. It appears he lost track of NY
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-07 18:10:48	@astorinorising @SeptSurprise @NYGovCuomo @ZephyrTeachout Did he have his body guards w/ him or does he rely on #NY SAFE ACT to protect him?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-07 18:14:17	@josephamodeo @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @zephyrteachout And they are not arrogant. NY needs a leader. @NYGovCuomo  has forgot his role in NY

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-11 15:06:49	@Lisa_Milicaj @CuomoWatch So what does that mean, he will now support corruption and dishonesty?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-11 15:53:22	@CuomoWatch @Lisa_Milicaj @superwuster @Credico2014 @HowieHawkins @RobAstorino Nov 4th is Republican Retribution Day. 1 more chance for us!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-11 16:09:27	@CuomoWatch @superwuster I am kind of confused, that is the only reason why he ran?? To weaken Republicans?? Dems are ruining this state.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-11 16:57:34	@nahmias @CuomoWatch @superwuster All @NYGovCuomo  had to do was be a MENCH, Shake her hand and welcome her 2 the parade and wish her luck.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-11 17:00:31	@nahmias @CuomoWatch @superwuster @NYGovCuomo Instead he let his arrogance and cockiness get the better of him. Nov 4th we will re pay him
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-11 17:49:35	@noturbine @StopFemaNow @kevinpentonAPP @JerseyShoreGive But as a victim myself, there are legit reasons. 2 people in a house need not apply

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-11 17:59:44	@CeaseCommonCore @CuomoWatch @AndyBarovick Video has nothing 2 do with #2A. Just a plain killer with a depraved indifference. Get it right
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-11 19:59:27	@helensmomma @CuomoWatch @NYGovGuomo Nov 4th, Republican payback. Time to send Andy to the unemployment line. Doesn't deserve another term
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-11 20:47:36	@SafetySal1 @CuomoWatch @A5H0KA @NYGovCuomo Only registered felons will vote for him. #NY SAFE ACT was enacted to make the criminals safer!

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-11 22:40:47	@helensmomma @BobPort Wu already lost credibility. If Zephyr publicly says she is not sure And is a turncoat. She is done with any future
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-11 22:45:48	@helensmomma @BobPort You cant act intelligent and talk like a fool. She knows we need a better leader to move #NY in to future. Be credible
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-10 16:40:15	@seemakalia @helensmomma  I think @NYGovCuomo prim win, is actually a loss. Add a few thousand republicans voters to the tally. VOTE ROB

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-12 01:16:01	AN INCUMBENT GOV WHO WANTS TO KEEP US BACKWARDS. 8.625% TAXES ON EVERYTHING. NOT BUSINESS OR RETIREMENT FRIENDLY. NO GUN RIGHTS, CANT LIVE
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-12 01:34:19	@btulamf @MercyMercyf @CuomoWatch Lets hops so, Nov 4 should be a day of celebration. NY needs 2 move forward. @NYGovCuomo  made me a felon
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-12 01:36:38	@btulamf @MercyMercyf @CuomoWatch @NYGovCuomo I had to toss my mags in the Atlantic for the fish to use. Now I am not a felon. 7 round only
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-12 01:48:52	@btulamf @MercyMercyf @CuomoWatch Why is it, NY&amp;NJ have strictest gun laws but shootings in the paper daily? U think Andy&amp; Christy that dumb
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-12 02:14:45	@NYSAFE Awesome poll. Lets hope it sticks and people do the right thing in Nov. Support @RobAstorino and @SheriffMoss
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-12 14:56:14	@NYSRPA @WSJPolitics Good Article. Glad to see @MomsDemand  enjoying coffee at starbucks. They are still trying to create gun free stores.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-12 14:56:41	@CuomoWatch Cannot get article
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-12 15:06:22	@NRAILA I think at a time when all the treaty countries hate us, why would Kerry sign our death warrant? Isn't Mexico holding a Marine??
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-12 02:51:43	@Lisa_Milicaj @CuomoWatch @phil_oliva @philreisman Hopefully the 6 million registered gun owners. Now that would be a landslide.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-12 03:05:58	@CuomoWatch @Lisa_Milicaj @phil_oliva @philreisman True but I would hope gun owners specifically are so angry w/ SAFEACT that more will vote
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-12 03:08:59	@CuomoWatch @Lisa_Milicaj @phil_oliva @philreisman Hey if Cuomo lost, I would have to jump in ocean to retrieve my 15 rd mag, lol. VOTE ROB

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-12 15:10:29	@NRAILA Mexico wants to dictate our gun laws. They have been holding an innocent Marine for many months now because of accidental crossing
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-12 15:24:28	@CuomoWatch Thanks. SO Stupid. There are better ways 2 waste tax dollars, We wouldn't be pasting our homes w/ signs if there was no SAFE ACT
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-12 18:35:12	@NYSAFE No insurance company will duplicate benefits. That's what people did. People who played the system required to pay back FEMA
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-12 18:41:30	@GOPLdrBrianKolb @helensmomma @LovelyAWarren @RobAstorino @SheriffMoss I would want to ask Rob if Westchester has Unrestricted Carry

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-14 02:02:31	@gretawire Do we want to jeopardize more Americans on the ground? Airstrikes would not be enough? Just drop a few thousand bombs on them.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-15 18:23:37	@sprintcare Ok Thanks for your help

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-15 18:34:18	@helensmomma Easy for me 2 say but try to be positive. That type of stress is unimaginable and can consume a person.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-15 19:09:54	@NYGovAstorino Wow, Politics is a dirty game. I think @NYGovCuomo  knows that he has competition and cannot rely on his record alone.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-15 19:40:13	@TimOwensby @NRAILA I think it would be very relevant if you came in w/ bullet wound. Other than that an MD is not qualified in firearms
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-15 20:03:07	@NYSAFE Well he has got a lot of time on his hands cause he isn't doing anything productive for NY. Hurricane victims are forgotten about!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-15 20:06:42	@NYSAFE Why won't @NYGovCuomo  make a statement and explain to us why shootings/Robberies are up since #NY SAFE ACT PASSAGE. Busy Hiding!

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-13 13:08:05	@astorinorising @NYGovCuomo  I don't even know what to say. Hard to believe the things that go on sometimes. That was a cop?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-13 13:12:02	@NRAILA Do criminals register and transfer? Oh I forgot, another law that exonerates felons and killers. Lets get the good guys only.

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-16 21:34:02	@helensmomma @RobAstorino That's why I can't stand his arrogance. His ideological ideas prevent him from seeing his faults &amp; making a change

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 22:05:38	@fernsummer The new attorney you left us with was pretty much out of loop &amp; not communicative as we hoped. You were an asset to NYLAG
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 22:12:44	@fernsummer Yes &amp; we owe it all to you. We wanted u to know how much we appreciate your help with FEMA &amp; getting me on twitter. Thanks again
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-17 20:38:50	@NYGovAstorino  PA does not tax food (except for ready-to-eat), clothing, apparel, textbooks, drugs residential heating fuels. We pay 8.625%
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-17 20:41:41	@NYGovAstorino Every year I travel to PA before school to outfit my son w? clothes &amp; supplies. 0% sales tax. Come on, why shop in NY. 8.625%
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-17 21:14:55	@helensmomma @RobAstorino Doesn't make sense, I mean he can't talk about 1 issue but what about the 20 other issues? Stop your hiding Andy !

@RobAstorino @CuomoWatch  Same old story but still people going where pensions R tax free and affordable&amp;sustainable
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 22:34:16	@WilliamBurrus @gretawire Well we R all entitled to our opin. If your OK with them dying, I am not. Too many deaths since 9/11. Very Sad
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 23:03:28	@WilliamBurrus @gretawire U sound like U R at war w/yourself. Why so angry. Seek help but don't rant to me about caring. Good luck to  you.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 23:05:51	@Joe_Gatto @truTVjokers When are you coming to Long Island? Would love to see you guys.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 23:08:25	@CuomoWatch @SafetySal1 @VinnyS914 Too many rich people here on Long Island and NYC who don't care about high taxes. I am talking, trying
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 23:10:55	@MercyMercyf @CuomoWatch @Lisa_Milicaj @NYSAFE I always believe the prosecutors &amp; judges can't be exempt from accountability when releasing
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 23:23:33	@VinnyS914 @CuomoWatch @SafetySal1 People R cynical here &amp; easily 4get things like corruption. There are tons of pistol license holders here
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 23:25:03	@SafetySal1 @CuomoWatch @VinnyS914 Yes I know, Lawn signs, Bumper stickers and just talking. Lawn sign does open some eyes to approach me
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 23:34:42	@SafetySal1 @VinnyS914 @CuomoWatch Yes, Nassau County PD will lie about it but I know certain people with power can get unrestricted carry.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 23:37:41	@VinnyS914 @CuomoWatch @SafetySal1 NCPD charges 200.00 2 renew every 5 yrs.PA non resident cost me 20.00 can someone explain that corruption
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 23:48:57	@CuomoWatch @VinnyS914 @SafetySal1 NYS retirement is a 40 yr system so I am stuck 4 awhile. Rob/Moss are my only hopeful option staying here
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-20 00:30:04	@astorinorising Where do you get his schedule? He is close to me
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 13:17:51	@thomaskaplan @RobAstorino Makes sense. Still so many people are ignorant or blind. Middle class is suffering. They better get out and vote
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 13:19:08	@AllenWest @helensmomma You would think if anything, there would be an executive order to seal our borders tight with gorilla glue. No joke
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 13:31:44	@Callisto1947 @CeaseCommonCore Well I have 2 show my license when I get an Xray or MRI, Bank Transactions, See a new doctor. Makes sense
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 14:01:13	@seemakalia @helensmomma @TIME Is this like a joke.Eric Holder?? Same person responsible 4 FAST &amp; FURIOUS? Do we forget that easy? Disgrace
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 14:03:49	@seemakalia @helensmomma @TIME Sometimes I wonder who is worse. The elected leaders 4 their corruption or the constituents 4 forgetting
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 14:06:41	@RobAstorino That's why we need Term Limits to take the garbage out. Our Senate, Congress, Assembly, they are all 2 comfortable. Retire them
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 14:10:46	@AndyBarovick @mma718 @CuomoWatch @quadgurl @RobAstorino Talking Facts only, SAFE ACT kills. Talk to Bronx DA. He wants to know why too.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 14:33:51	@gretawire I agree but who is willing 2 put their child on the ground to fight an enemy that wants to die? Air support w/other countries 1st
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 14:35:29	@jessicaproud @helensmomma @NYGovCuomo Other programs are fine. Lets complete NY Rising 1st and stop ignoring Sandy victims. They need help
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 14:39:56	@helensmomma @jessicaproud @NYGovCuomo I think Andy got bored with Sandy Victims so he said, "Lets try Start Up NY" &amp; the victims will 4 get
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-20 19:44:25	@WNYC @FloodPA_Becky Needs to be better HMP in NY. NY Rising very slow &amp; not productive. Many home here over 50 % but not mandated to raise.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-20 19:51:28	@RoRoscoe @phil_oliva @Snap_Politics Hey, As long as @NYGovCuomo's security team follows the #NY SAFE ACT and carry's 7 rds in a 10. its OK
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-20 20:03:35	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @RobAstorino http://t.co/pJhwQ1tNfx Y R  people so quiet? NYers should be outraged with all these shootings W/ SAFE ACT?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-20 20:05:44	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @RobAstorino The #NY SAFE ACT was supposed 2 make us safer. Y is nobody putting @NYGovCuomo on the stand to question him
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-20 20:08:33	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo You think the voters of Queens will still vote Andy? When will NYers get fed up with a fraud??
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-17 23:28:54	@gretawire @TGowdySC Who said this " WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE NOW"
Death of 4 Americans insignificant to this person. Can you guess??
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-17 23:46:05	@gretawire My son is 19. This is scary &amp; the Democratic goal is 2 disarm law abiding gun owners. Citizens need to be able 2 defend our soil!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-18 00:39:04	@edleighton9 @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino After Murder of Brendan Tevlin, Threat of terror imminent. Does ISIS have to comply with SAFE ACT?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-18 00:40:55	@edleighton9 @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino i am sorry, My mistake. @NYGovCuomo only looking to disarm law abiding. Not the mental and depraved!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-19 18:01:07	@fernsummer Hi Fern, Are you still on this Twitter account?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-21 00:09:38	@CuomoWatch Great article. I think the word is slowly sinking in that law abiding do not Kill, Rob &amp; Steal. Hopefully we prevail w/SAFE ACT
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-21 00:11:20	@CuomoWatch @YahooFinance Whats is more shameful is that Eric Holder still gets a paycheck from our taxes. That is criminal. Fast &amp; Furious?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-21 00:33:03	@upst8patriot @CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @RobAstorino NY lacks accountability. @NYGovCuomo &amp; Shelly pass a law that encourages people 2 kill.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-21 00:35:06	@upst8patriot @CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo With all these shootings, where do criminals get ammo? I can barely get some!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-21 18:27:06	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @RobAstorino http://t.co/PqcezVJcsU I THINK THIS MAKES 5 REPORTED SHOOTINGS 4 WEEKEND. WHEN WILL CITY DA'S COME 2 LIFE??
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-21 18:37:18	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @RobAstorino Y R @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand @SenatorSkelos @carolynmccarthy SO QUIET ABOUT RISE IN SHOOTINGS W/ SAFEACT?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-21 18:39:13	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @RobAstorino  DO THESE ELECTED OFFICIALS ONLY WAKE UP FOR A MASS SHOOTING BUT COULD CARE LESS ABOUT EVERY DAY SHOOTINGS?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-21 23:20:00	@helensmomma @The_Citizen You wonder why @SenatorSkelos never thought of this &amp; he's on the job 4 awhile. Did he think SAFE ACT was better??
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-21 23:24:06	@helensmomma @The_Citizen @SenatorSkelos Very hard to believe that. Why is Skelos not outraged at all these shootings after SAFE ACT. REPEAL
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-21 23:26:57	@helensmomma @The_Citizen @SenatorSkelos I mean, even Shelly. Does he enjoy knowing his SAFE ACT has failed and people getting shot everyday
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-21 23:30:31	@helensmomma @The_Citizen @SenatorSkelos @GOPLdrBrianKolb Skelos definitely not a 2nd Amend supporter. Nobody seems mad w/ all the shootings
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-21 23:33:53	@helensmomma @The_Citizen @SenatorSkelos @GOPLdrBrianKolb I agree. things we should be teaching our kids &amp; never 4 get we are in AMERICA.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-21 23:39:15	@FloodPA_Becky What steps have you taken on rating. You contact your local state senator? Did you have them do a congressional inquiry ?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-22 19:32:54	@ShepNewsTeam Wow, A law abiding citizen cannot even get that anymore thanks to the UNSAFE ACT. Where did he get it from??
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-22 19:34:55	@BallisticCases Whats going on with HARD CORE case for the iphone 6? Does anyone have them?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-22 20:15:17	@NYSAFE When it comes to SAFE ACT, NO forgive or 4 get. If U voted to hurt us, we will vote against U. This law kills and hurts everyone!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-22 21:00:43	@BallisticCases I signed up already. I have the phone but need a case before I activate it. Any idea when?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 02:04:51	@FloodPA_Becky Yes did get flood cert. I just got a favorable ruling from FEMA that they will exclude crawl from premium. Just got letter.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 02:06:37	@FloodPA_Becky It took a year but with pictures and evidence showing its a sump pump area &amp; dirt only. What the hell are they covering
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 02:07:53	@gretawire At least its air strikes. No ground forces
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 02:09:57	@helensmomma Yes I agree, watching Shep now. May they all be safe
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 02:52:49	@helensmomma Did Shep say 143 million for one plane?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 14:42:56	@NYSAFE I would use towards higher electric bill in summer and increase in optimum cable bill. Now a million might influence me a bit, lol
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 20:13:02	@Lisa_Milicaj @CuomoWatch @HannahBuehler @WKBW @RobAstorino That would be another 4 yrs of NY Rising case managers not returning calls!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 20:16:14	@helensmomma @RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo Every big story is 4 gotten by another. That's what politicians hope 4. Eric Holder got his wish too.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 20:18:40	@OswegoCountyGOP @KieranLalor He is congratulating himself on increase in shootings since SAFE ACT &amp; hoping the registered felons will vote
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 20:21:20	@helensmomma @RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo Prob true. Everyone scared too talk. Shootings in every borough &amp; @SenatorSkelos  doesn't say a word
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 20:23:01	@helensmomma @RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo @SenatorSkelos I called and emailed my NY Ris case manager and no call back. There is no leadership
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 20:30:09	@helensmomma @RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo @SenatorSkelos At the end of the day, State, Fema &amp; yes tax dollars. @JonKaiman was supposed to run it
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 20:31:08	@helensmomma @RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo @SenatorSkelos @JonKaiman An appointee of Andy. He has been AWOL not replying to his twitter account
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 20:42:35	@NYSRPA @DailyCaller Did @NJGovChristie see this? Is that PA women getting the same deal. She forgot too. Christie ignored our letters!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-22 19:28:15	@jeffdunham I got mine in the mail on Friday. Pre order is awesome. No 12 blocks of people waiting. Only now there R no cases in stock, LOL
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 02:24:36	@helensmomma Whats amazing is there R 4 Arab nations working with us. Not just American war. They all want ISIS defeated. We R not alone.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-23 02:31:39	@helensmomma Yes. We cannot go alone. Shouldn't just be America against terror. The world should be against it. shep getting amateur video
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 00:46:28	@astorinorising Of course he has the cowardly pleasure of riding with body guards while he disarms the rest of us. We are not worthy to him.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 00:48:36	@helensmomma @MercyMercyf @Rob_Base_ @CuomoWatch @seemakalia I found out hours ago but been busy, why did Holder resign. I was happy

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-27 15:42:16	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE Hey @SenatorSkelos , Y so quiet about all these shootings after #NY SAFE ACT? Why not help @RobAstorino Get Elected !!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 01:30:43	GO JETER
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 01:58:16	@ShepNewsTeam Lying about fast and furious to disarm law abiding Americans. He should have been fired long ago.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-27 17:45:00	@helensmomma Truthfully, Probably ISIS. They already have American weapons R pulling strings of white House, while Obama tries 2 disarm Us
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-27 17:49:00	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @ProGunOwner @SenatorSkelos I supported &amp; voted 4 him 4 yrs &amp; he turned on his party&amp; law abiding citizens. I am ashamed
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 02:01:54	@helensmomma Only if there is reciprocity. Will the illegals country let Americans cross border &amp; vote. That is fair now. cant be one way
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 02:06:47	@Linda1MMAGC @CamEdwards @kroger I think @MomsDemand &amp; @NYAGV1 would prefer the 11 yr old get shot. They only support &amp; harbor the criminal
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 02:08:50	@NRA @NRAILA He should spend his money on donations to Cancer Society. Not protecting and supporting depraved killers. He hates good people
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 02:13:06	@krhong5 @truTVjokers @SalVulcano @jamessmurray What a mistake to air on the same night as Yankee Game, LOL. Sorry guys. Your on DVR tonight
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 02:19:50	WOW, AWESOME HIT JETER
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-27 19:36:53	@HollyRFisher @helensmomma Picture would be great with American flag background 2 show what we R losing thanks to Obama, Kerry, Holder.etc
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 21:25:02	@PatVPeters @CeaseCommonCore That's because the police who interact with the public, know that we aren't the problem. Depraved killers are!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 21:26:46	@RobAstorino @GowtFlo My 350 will go to architect because NY Rising is way behind on contractor payments. Thanks for nothing @NYGovCuomo
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 21:36:16	@k9dobny @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino You never know, Shelly may just resign. His bullying days will be over 2 if Rob wins.Shelly wont be missed
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 21:40:21	@FloodPA_Becky NY Legal Assistance group helped with from the start. &amp; then congressional Inq. Rates will still increase in Jan no doubt.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 23:25:22	@albanyproject @CuomoWatch I am quite sure that is a joke. Not possible 4 @NYGovCuomo 2 be that high on something. Sandy Victims 4 gotten!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 23:29:23	@trippy1948 @helensmomma @YahooNews ISIS becoming homegrown terror. Temporary injunction on SAFEACT so we can defend ourselves would be nice
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 23:33:42	@helensmomma @trippy1948 @YahooNews Yes, more of a gun friendly state. Here in NY we would have 7rds to defend ourselves &amp; no ammo available
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-26 23:37:47	@helensmomma @trippy1948 @YahooNews I lost hundreds of rounds in storm. More expensive now 2 stock up. Local stores here R limited w/ supply
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-27 01:04:33	@NRA @NRAILA  I think @NYGovCuomo &amp; @MikeBloomberg hate it when the good guy wins.They just want 2 arm the killers. Time 2 retire Andy
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-27 03:07:09	@RobAstorino @helensmomma I always have to correct Rob, Not only worst, but impossible w/ a 40 yr retirement system. I am stuck, like jail
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-28 02:20:19	@NYGovCuomo @helensmomma He's a sportsman, a fisherman, a hunter &amp; a crime fighter. He cleaned the streets of us law abiding citizens. Hero
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-28 02:27:53	@CuomoWatch @ball4ny @NYGovCuomo I am still waiting for @SenatorSkelos  2 Tell all the shooting victims families that the SAFEACT is working
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-28 02:29:34	@CuomoWatch @ball4ny @NYGovCuomo @SenatorSkelos I am Deans constituent. Where R U dean. DO u visit families after their loves ones are shot?

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-24 17:49:14	@SCOPEtheVote Wow, cool! Does this apply to felons &amp; killers and make judges &amp; prosecutors accountable. Better include mass killers too!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-28 14:31:43	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE http://t.co/aliKJCCh5a MAYBE @SenatorSkelos &amp; @NYGovCuomo  can introduce a New SAFE ACT banning bread and steak knives
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-29 01:06:18	@GowtFlo @helensmomma @RobAstorino @CuomoWatch @NYGovAstorino Did not get a check but donated on Robs website. Glad he is getting support
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-29 01:21:08	@k9dobny @helensmomma Hard 2 believe when you add it up per day &amp; then we pay again in our paycheck. No relief. 350 check a slap in the face
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-29 01:24:20	@helensmomma @k9dobny I know. Like I said, It will go towards architect until NY Rising pays me back. My son is 19, Will I get a check?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-29 01:27:08	@helensmomma @k9dobny And when it comes 2 guns, I'm ready 4 ISIS. Got my 7 rds ready, LOL Can we load 7 and the rest bean bag rounds?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-24 20:13:54	@CuomoWatch @GannettAlbany Maybe I can use the check 2 bribe an architect 2 work in my home. NY Rising behind on paying contractors. SAD
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-29 02:30:47	@NYSRPA Wonder why @Newsday @News12LI @NBCNews R so quiet with all these recent shootings. Y don't they ask @NYGovCuomo  Y SAFE ACT failed
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 15:47:55	@GunOwners Wonderful idea. Keep the establishment safe by letting the gangs &amp; dirt bags know they are not wanted. Lesson for @MikeBloomberg
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 15:49:54	@russfelix @GunOwners @RightOrgs Well here is question? Would U rather gang members walk in armed or a law abiding citizen who can save You?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 15:55:03	@helensmomma @NYSAFE @RobAstorino I agree, One hurdle at a time. Unfortunately  Shelly is laying very low and silent so we forget about him
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-29 21:44:47	@helensmomma Oh, I didnt ask that
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-29 21:52:53	@helensmomma No Problem, I just got home so it wasn't me. I thought there were new polls showing that. Would love to see Rob ahead.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 00:25:21	@NRA @NRAILA Good Work. Ever wonder Y Mike never questions Y shootings have increased since SAFE ACT. Have the city rats bit off his tongue?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 00:26:31	@EnblocGarand @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino I got some bumper stickers but no buttons, LOL Nice
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 00:35:36	@CuomoWatch @nypost Pretty sad. I did everything right and the Town of Hempstead Buildings dept still giving me hard time post Sandy 4 A CO
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 00:47:32	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @RobAstorino http://t.co/ew3IGjNyNt I am still waiting 4 @SenatorSkelos to get pissed at @NYGovCuomo for SAFEACT FAILURE
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 01:08:37	@JOEBANNAS @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino I would think @NYGovCuomo would be 2 embarrassed to talk about anyone. more shootings thanks 2 SAFE ACT
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 01:12:22	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE U think @SenatorSkelos is visiting all these families of shooting victims &amp; telling them he helped passed the SAFE ACT?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 01:21:12	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE http://t.co/qPxQYZHVpQ (Update) I hope @SenatorSkelos is getting my tweets. Maybe he can get Shelly 2 visit some victims
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 19:45:32	@russfelix @GunOwners @RightOrgs Your looking at it the wrong way. It actually creates a gun free zone for dirt bags. Who's going 2 rob them
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 19:47:26	@russfelix @GunOwners @RightOrgs Statistics show that states that make it easy for law abiding 2 carry, there are less violent crimes. Safer
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 19:49:59	@SteveMcNY @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino What could @NYGovCuomo say about Sandy Victims in a debate. Would he say he wrote us off? Forgot us? Lie
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 19:59:16	@NBCNewYork NY is the Vampire state. Bridges/Tunnels, LIRR, buses, Taxes on fuel, 8.625% on every receipt every day what ever we buy.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 20:17:46	@CuomoWatch @RobAstorino http://t.co/00ChkYHuwt WOW, @SenatorSkelos supports U Rob. He supports U from his closed office. Give Dean a Button
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 21:14:53	@Rob_Base_ @angelmommy773 @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @SenatorSkelos  He should have paid off Newsday not print such a dumb article of lies.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 21:40:29	@russfelix @GunOwners @RightOrgs Are you a gun owner? Not sure where U live but in NY, gangs &amp; criminals run the streets, Not government
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 23:44:21	@KieranLalor @dgazette Either way, will never come close 2 every day sales tax items on what we spend. 8.625% way more than 350. Cant Live!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 23:56:03	@gretawire @RosLehtinen I agree. He made a wrong turn into Mexico &amp; they put him in jail. Illegals cross our border, they get Gov benefits!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-30 23:58:59	@helensmomma @gretawire @RosLehtinen He only care about playing golf and signing UN Arms Treaties to disarm his own country &amp; welcomes ISIS
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 00:03:31	@CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @SenatorSkelos http://t.co/OglD8nQ3b7 I just figured out what we can do with the 350 rebate. We can give it to PSEG
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 00:05:24	@CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @SenatorSkelos Does Dean &amp; Andy really think 350 is enough bribe money? Going to take additional zeroes for me $$$$
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 00:08:39	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @NYGovCuomo @SenatorSkelos @MikeBloomberg http://t.co/brDYGnMnBT DON'T YOU JUST LOVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SAFE ACT??
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 00:41:32	@russfelix @GunOwners @RightOrgs  OK, You may be right, I originally thought you said the sight of a gun ruined your meal. Thats what I read
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 00:49:32	@angelmommy773 @MercyMercyf @KLSouth Sometimes not enough room, LOL
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 01:20:40	@MercyMercyf @astorinorising @angelmommy773 @KLSouth Maybe get 140 word increase to 240 Just for election season, lol #WinningAstorino
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 02:06:16	@Bozzy60 @helensmomma Very sad story. And on May 7 2013, Hilary said "WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE"  Everyone forgot that &amp; gave her a pass
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 02:10:41	@helensmomma @Bozzy60 I will bet you she wins the presidency, lol. people love her and will forget. Just like Holder, All crooks and liers
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 02:12:09	@BobLonsberry @helensmomma And the same government that signs a UN Arms Treaty with countries that want us all dead. Is Kerry like a dummy??
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 02:17:15	@BobLonsberry @helensmomma I think ISIS is waiting for Obama by Exec Order to pass more gun laws &amp; disarm us before they start to attack us
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 02:22:03	@helensmomma @BobLonsberry And Schumer, Mccarthy, Bloomberg, Skelos, shelly,. whole list of leaders who forgot what America once was. SAD
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 02:26:03	@helensmomma @BobLonsberry Remember, Only 140 words, lol. more to list. #rob4ny @RobAstorino is our only option. Hope true Americans prevail
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-29 01:09:29	@k9dobny @helensmomma I needed a replacement car battery. 11.31 for tax @ 8.625. We get taxed on every damm item we buy. Andys got to GO!!!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-29 01:19:41	@GowtFlo @helensmomma @RobAstorino @CuomoWatch Took my Mom &amp; son 2 lunch &amp; movie in Brooklyn. Every receipt taxed. It adds up daily.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-02 22:08:25	@truTV @truTVjokers That was awesome, Sal is a riot. Never saw Joe on the floor. Is this new or not seen clip?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-02 22:13:07	@CuomoWatch @RobAstorino #rob4ny I WAS IN HOBOKEN NJ TODAY. IS THERE A REASON WHY WE DO NOT PAY THIS PRICE IN NY???? http://t.co/bOMCGQ2l4G
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-02 22:22:54	@OBAMA_GAMES @helensmomma @cspanwj He is too busy on the golf course. Not a priority for him. Signing UN Arms treaties with terrorists is!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-02 22:30:04	@NYSRPA Y Texas, Y not NYC. He left it with increased shootings. Don't need travel. They should meet at the gang clubhouses to educate them!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-02 22:31:19	@bluebaby0526 @truTV @truTVjokers Ok, Kind of long for a preview. Was not sure. Thanks

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 14:54:42	@russfelix Truth is, Borders are open, ISIS is here &amp; people tired of criminals preying on innocent people. We all want 2 protect ourselves
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 14:57:10	@RobAstorino @TALK1300 @fud31 Good interview. I guess @NYGovCuomo going to Sharptons birthday. Was Sharpton at the funeral of RPD Officer?

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 16:29:56	@CapitalTonight @CuomoWatch @jessicaproud http://t.co/fgAuztkUnl  How does everything go up and salaries stay the same. Time for Welfare??
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 19:50:34	@astorinorising @NYGovCuomo I agree, Hilary Will be our next president. They like her more than 4 dead Americans. People forget easily. SAD
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 20:06:57	@NRAILA You got 2 hand it 2 @MikeBloomberg . He leaves the city with more shootings thanks 2 his gun laws &amp; he smiles.Give the man a Slurpee
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 20:09:07	@SpeakerBoehner @helensmomma If anyone loses their healthcare, It should be the people that voted for him 2nd term. When will they learn??
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 20:14:43	@SonnyRaye @helensmomma Things 2 outlaw that kills, Cars, Guns, Golf Clubs, Steak Knives, Planes, Stair cases. We need Executive Orders here
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 20:20:17	@helensmomma @SonnyRaye Well at least golf clubs.Then Obama would have nothing 2 do while he is supposed 2 be working or on his 1/2 hr lunch
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 20:55:37	@SenatorSkelos @CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @RobAstorino #rob4ny http://t.co/y8nBRiQgGt Didnt they know about @NYGovCuomo #NY SAFE ACT? What a shame
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-01 20:58:27	@NBCNewYork Where were the Armed Guards? Oh Yeah I forgot, @MikeBloomberg does not like law abiding citizens carrying guns for self defense!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-29 21:41:01	@helensmomma Why do you say that?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-03 01:07:01	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @SenatorSkelos @RobAstorino http://t.co/dqZ6kuVTrq DO I SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD? REPEAL THE SAFEACT DEAN. NOT WORKING

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-03 01:11:21	WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU NEED TO FILL UP,  DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH MORE NYERS PAY? DO WE DESERVE LESS THAN NJ? http://t.co/7mFfps0Jyo
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-03 01:15:44	@BlueLineAcross @MercyMercyf Very sad. Local governments do not care about this. They are only concerned about disarming law abiding. SAD
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-03 01:19:12	@BlueLineAcross @MercyMercyf #NY SAFE ACT doesn't target the cop killer. it targets the hunter, sportsman, competitor. Why @SenatorSkelos ?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-03 01:22:20	@BlueLineAcross @MercyMercyf When will @MikeBloomberg @SenatorSkelos @NYGovCuomo Start to target the real criminals &amp; not us sportsman? WHEN
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-03 01:25:07	@Chris_1791 @MercyMercyf @SenatorReid Harry ignored our NATIONAL RECIPROCITY BILL. prevented it from coming to floor for vote. Thanks Harry
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-09-29 21:41:36	@k9dobny @helensmomma @RobAstorino @SheriffMoss @CuomoWatch I got a bargain at BJs. If U spend 50.00, U get 5 cents off a gal. 3.27. Not bad
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-03 20:10:03	@jeffdunham When are you coming back to Long Island? Would love to see you again.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-03 20:13:00	@helensmomma @CuomoWatch The sad thing is that these idiots think they are crime fighters. They have dug NY into such a hole. #rob4ny VOTE
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-03 20:30:59	@NYSRPA @WAMCRadio When will any of our assembly ever actually go after criminals and gangs. NY Assembly refuses to fight crime. Disgraceful
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-03 21:26:45	@wfbor @CuomoWatch Give me a break about the holiday. U really think Shelly is going 2 answer anything on the other 364 days? He doesnt care
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-04 20:07:49	@Tahawus506 @CuomoWatch @TeriKWeaver Over past few weeks, multiple shootings on Long island &amp; NYC only handguns &amp; steak knives involved.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-04 20:13:22	@JoePaulson2 @SenGillibrand @BuzzFeed @Meemie24 @RobAstorino Not so fast, #NY SAFE ACT protects gangs &amp; killers and disarms law abiding. WHY
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-04 20:15:05	@JoePaulson2  @BuzzFeed @Meemie24 @RobAstorino  I have written to @SenGillibrand many times on failed SAFE ACT and she does not reply 2 any!

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-04 21:27:20	@ChelEarle @CuomoWatch @nranews @michaelvlawler Watching Stossel on FNC RE: gun violence. Bloomberg statistics all false. Bunch of lies
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-04 15:20:47	@RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo Not the only reason for Shelly to resign. There are many reasons like failing at his job description 4 many years!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-04 15:30:28	@wfbor @helensmomma @NYGovCuomo @RobAstorino I guess the same reason Y they gave criminals &amp; gangs a pass w/SAFE ACT. they are both failures
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-04 15:36:33	WHO IS PROUD TO BE A NYer? R U PROUD TO PAY MORE FOR GOODS &amp; FUEL? WHY IS NJ CITIZENS PAY LESS FOR GAS? ANY ANSWERS? http://t.co/h01ietvPBt

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-04 16:05:13	@helensmomma @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo @SenatorSkelos When did Skelos become a bully and hate gun owners? SAFE ACT is killing
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-04 16:09:19	@helensmomma @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @NYGovCuomo @SenatorSkelo hope Andy &amp; Skelos going 2 Bellmore 2 tell invasion victims SAFEACT WORKING
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 00:29:00	@patriotsongbird @CuomoWatch @edleighton9 @NYGovCuomo Fact is, architects not getting paid for 6100 forms. NY Rising very behind on payments
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 00:44:09	@homelessbysandy @LindyPatch Why denied? I am waiting for NY Rising to fund architect to draw plans. Were you over 50% damage post Sandy?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 00:52:59	@edleighton9 @CuomoWatch @NYGovCuomo Some businesses in Nassau have recently opened back up without NY Rising help. NYR so behind on $$$$
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 00:57:53	@patriotsongbird @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @angelmommy773 @GowtFlo Did I miss something. What did NRA do?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 01:01:55	@patriotsongbird @CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @angelmommy773 @GowtFlo I sent 2 letters to @NRA__LaPierre on an issue &amp; he hasn't responded 2 me
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 01:51:41	@CuomoWatch @patriotsongbird @RobAstorino @angelmommy773 @GowtFlo Wow, Just read it. He does need some money. I spend a lot at NRA store.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 01:54:37	@homelessbysandy @LindyPatch Dont understand. FEMA took over?? Dont you have a policy in force w/NFIP? How not insured?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 01:56:37	@homelessbysandy When was this?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 02:08:14	@LindyGazette @homelessbysandy I had no idea. Well it would be cost effective to raise homes there. Why deny? Has water intruded homes?
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-04 18:16:53	@NRAILA The truth is, @MikeBloomberg cannot be credited with saving one life. By making NYC a gun free zone made it a safe haven for gangs
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 02:19:20	@homelessbysandy @LindyGazette That is crazy. Have you reached out to your local US Senator &amp; @femaregion2  to come down and see situation

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 02:28:46	@homelessbysandy @LindyGazette @femaregion2 Well I fought fema on re rating issue with attorney and US Senator &amp; I won. You cannot give up
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 02:33:22	@homelessbysandy @LindyGazette Ever hear of NY Legal Assistance group. Free legal work on sandy cases if you qualify. 212-613-5000. Try it
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 02:44:44	@homelessbysandy @LindyGazette Jerome Hatfield is FEMA Region 2 ADMIN. Everyone on your block needs to be calling daily and ur senator
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 02:50:16	@homelessbysandy @LindyPatch I understand rate increase but that is why army corps go around and look at flood areas to determine HM program
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 02:51:51	@homelessbysandy @LindyGazette Cuomo stole money from NY Rising funds. He does not care. Make sure all your neighbors Vote 4 Astorino.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-05 02:53:21	@homelessbysandy @LindyGazette I called my NY Senator 4 help because Cuomo 4 got about us. He has failed NY and is under investigation

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-03 18:07:20	@helensmomma @CuomoWatch Local news reporters R scripted. They ask nothing. We need more people like Megan Kelly or Bill O'reilly to ask it

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-11 23:46:22	@angelmommy773 Funny thing is that people that R supposed to run things, R not Sandy victims and don't have a vested interest in our cause
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-12 00:16:52	@helensmomma @angelmommy773 @CuomoWatch @SteveMcNY @JonKaiman  So many NYC residents still voting 4 Andy even as they struggle to re build.

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-17 18:22:03	@ELehpamer12 @News12LI News12 Should be asking @NYGovCuomo why #NY SAFE ACT does not deter gangs and criminals. Only targets law abiding!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-17 21:14:01	@RobAstorino That is if you can retire. Almost have 26 yrs in NY system and have 10 more to go. Why a 40 yr system???? NYC is 25 yrs.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-17 21:20:01	@NYSRPA  @leezeldin In my opinion, @NYAGV1 should be asking why we have so many shootings and home invasions with failed #NY SAFE ACT.

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-18 23:26:11	@CuomoWatch I wonder why @NYGovCuomo felt it more important to travel there &amp; not travel to displaced Sandy victims waiting for NY Rising $$
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-10-18 23:32:32	@NRAILA Only the gangs and depraved killers can carry unrestricted. Laws never target them anyway. Criminals love these stupid laws. UNSAFE

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-04 00:40:45	@ChaseSupport She ignored my letters and calls. They raised the rate on the current balance. How disgusting. I still have card but dont use
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-04 00:41:20	@ChaseSupport Jeff Greenberg zip 11518

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-04 00:56:34	@greta @SenatorHarkin @joniernst I think if Biden can tell us its OK to fire warning shots with a 12 gauge, Get over this and move on!
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-04 22:36:58	@CuomoWatch @RobAstorino @SheriffMoss #rob4ny Just left school. Casted my vote 4 rob &amp; Chris. Nothing left 2 do except hope &amp; pray 4 freedom
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-02 23:23:05	@ASHighCap @TheNBBA Yes, I had read he wants gun owners to purchase liability insurance. I am not sure if this would apply to gangs &amp; felons
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-03 00:22:51	@ASHighCap @TheNBBA We need #rob4ny. @NYGovCuomo is a disgrace 4 not going after gangs &amp; criminals. Only enjoys harassing law abiding. SAD
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-03 00:25:47	@helensmomma @MercyMercyf @makeyourmove33 @astorinorising Not jail, Mental institution. They are both delusional &amp; out of touch with NY
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-03 00:29:10	@helensmomma @MercyMercyf @makeyourmove33 @astorinorising My stomach turns thinking about another 4 w/them. Out of spite, he will retaliate.
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-03 00:36:48	@makeyourmove33 @helensmomma @MercyMercyf @astorinorising Are the doors to Pilgrim State still open. Maybe they can find a dirty cell w/rats
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-03 01:09:06	@helensmomma @makeyourmove33 @MercyMercyf @astorinorising Rykers he will be a king there. SAFE ACT protects felons &amp; gangs, They adore him

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-05 00:28:59	@megynkelly Looks like the Republican party. People are tired of lies, deception and any candidate who supports our president. Vote American
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-05 01:26:26	@li_firearms I am kind of surprised
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-04 14:06:17	@CuomoWatch #rob4ny I HOPE @RobAstorino &amp; @SheriffMoss can wait 4 my vote! After work at 4pm, I will help restore NY AND FREEDOM. Good Luck
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-05 02:32:14	@astorinorising NYC residents love paying enormous taxes and corruption. May they never bitch again after this. NYC enjoys failure

2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-21 20:41:30	@LBRising @StopFemaNowLI finally got a check to hire architect and soil test. Took 6 months
2317865342	firefighters510	2014-11-21 20:45:13	@StopFemaNowLI @JonKaiman @SenSchumer  I have been asking that question for months. Jon kaiman ignores his Twitter account and has no phone
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-02-06 13:04:51	@StopFemaNow @GMiloscia NY rising not making offers in my area and soil bore test cannot be done on property. Now what?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-03-17 11:18:30	@helensmomma @firefighters510 @nomore I wish you the best. A lot of laws need changing like shooting at a cop. Death penalty sounds good!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-03-29 14:05:00	@profplotch that's why need term limits. The ideas of some of our leaders are destroying America. We lost those true American values.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-03-29 16:43:21	@profplotch sounds good
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-04-14 14:07:10	@AmyMek @nysafeact This sign should be NY's motto. Should be posted when u enter NY STATE. A criminal friendly state thanks to our governor
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-04-22 14:53:01	@NYSRPA I think law abiding people r more disgusted with politicians who want 2 trample on our rights and spit on the 2A &amp; ignore criminals
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-04-25 12:00:59	@StopFemaNow @phillydotcom what about families that had to walk away from their homes after storm when moron NFIP adjusters denied money?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-04-25 13:12:31	@StopFemaNow @phillydotcom took me over a year to fight a re rating issue. People who had to foreclose will never get credit restored. Sad
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-04-26 12:52:47	WHEN WILL @NYGovCuomo FORCE GANGS AND KILLERS TO APPLY 4 PISTOL LICENSES AND CARRY 7 ROUNDS LIKE US LAW ABIDING?
WHEN DID WE BECOME TARGETS?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-04-25 17:03:02	@truTVjokers @BQQuinn awesome punishment. Where was the jeep sent for cleaning? Lol
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-04-25 17:14:57	@conserv_tribune it's unfortunate that @NYGovCuomo @SenSchumer have not heard this speech. Shootings increase since #NYSAFEACT @RobAstorino
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-04-27 13:05:22	@StopFemaNow @phillydotcom FEMA FINALLY GRANTED MY APPEAL BUT @Allstate WILL NOT REMOVE MY 2nd STORY RATING. I ONLY HAVE A ONE LEVEL HOME
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-04-27 14:10:26	@li_firearms I guess @MomsDemand prefer gangs and criminals to be the only ones to carry. Law abiding citizens do not kill and rob.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-04-27 18:15:51	@GunOwners Best story of the day!!!!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-04-29 00:51:19	@News12LI Thought they were rebuilding to make a better environment. Where was security or PD? This is why people are afraid to shop there
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-04-29 00:58:51	@StopFemaNow @phillydotcom @Allstate MY ATTORNEY SENT 2nd LETTER REQUESTING ALLSTATE TO COMPLY WITH FEMA's DECISION &amp; RE RATE 2 A 1 STORY

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-01 17:10:30	@alison524 @StopFemaNowLI @SenatorSkelos call who?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-01 17:20:53	@noturbine @StopFemaNow @Telegraph @davidgmillward More than 1 family member per household can't apply for DA. Many did and should repay.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-01 17:22:08	@noturbine @StopFemaNow @Telegraph @davidgmillward duplication of benefits is unlawful and some did take advantage. There r legit reasons
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-04-30 18:14:33	@conserv_tribune The Mayor and Judge should be commended. Too bad NY politicians are not tough on crime. They only target law abiding here.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-02 17:10:57	@NRA @NRAILA I guess the people feel safer with the thugs and gang members carrying uzi's. When will American citizens wake from their slump

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-03 00:24:30	@BI_contributors @greta #2A @NYSAFE TIME 2 REPEAL #NYSAFEACT. WHY WONT @NYGovCuomo GO AFTER GANGS &amp; CRIMINALS &amp; NOT LAW ABIDING GUN OWNERS?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-03 00:32:54	WHEN WILL @Newsday QUESTION THE INCREASE IN SHOOTINGS SINCE #NYSAFEACT? SAFE ACT FAILS 2 TARGET THUGS &amp; CRIMINAL &amp; HARASSES LAW ABIDING. WHY
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-03 23:11:31	@Newsday Will he be charged under the Safe Act? Does he have a valid pistol license? How many rounds were in his magazine? NY IS UNSAFE!!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-03 23:16:33	@sprint Why was service so poor in the 11518 area code?  LTE signal is so poor and minimal and keeps going back to 3G. Is LTE set up yet?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-03 23:23:17	@sprintcare No, Coverage was poor today but LTE has been like non existent here. I get a quick signal and then it goes away.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-03 23:38:34	@sprintcare How do I accomplish that?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-03 23:43:53	@sprintcare Are you talking about on my Iphone or PC ? Not sure what your talking about
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-03 23:51:32	@sprintcare Are you telling me your app is my Iphone 6? I cannot find it

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-04 00:32:42	@sprintcare You would think its simple but its not. Everytime i click on coverage map, its gives me savings and coupons. no diag icon

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-03 11:40:32	@Newsday TIME TO REPEAL #NYSAFEACT &amp; WRITE A LAW THAT WILL GO AFTER CRIMINALS. LAW ABIDING GUN OWNERS DONT SHOOT COPS. #2A @NYSAFE
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-03 11:46:46	@GREGCERGOL4NY @NBCNewYork WHEN WILL NEWS 4 QUESTION THE FAILURE OF #NYSAFEACT? Y R THERE MORE SHOOTINGS? THE LAW ONLY TARGETS  LAW ABIDING

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-03 13:34:24	@NBCNewYork I WONDER WHY THE #nysafeact DOES NOT MAKE JUGDES ACCOUNTABLE FOR RELEASING FELONS. @NYGovCuomo only goes after law abiding. #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-04 19:04:24	.@PeiSzeCheng4NY @NBCNewYork I think it's time News 4 questions the passage of the Safe Act. A law that targets only law abiding only. WHY?

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-04 11:16:26	@sprintcare there is no diagnosis icon. Under the menu items there is support but that's not it. What does icon look like?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-05 12:18:16	@alison524 @StopFemaNowLI @SenatorSkelos What happens if FEMA grants my appeal back 2 1 level but @Allstate refuses to correct my rating?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-05 12:21:16	@alison524 @StopFemaNowLI @SenatorSkelos @Allstate claims my 3 ft crawl is a livable floor but FEMA said its not. Who can I sue??
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-04 12:31:52	@StopFemaNow Mitigation makes sense but adding another 100 grand to lift is unreasonable. 2 yrs with NYR and still haven't lifted. Long wait
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-03 21:00:10	http://t.co/1owcIHZy18 THE BEST PART OF BEING A CRIMINAL IN NY IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW THE SAME LAWS AS A LAW ABIDING GUN OWNER !!

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-05 01:25:28	@NBCNewYork I watch news 4 daily &amp; wonder why your so silent on how a released felon can get a gun under the SAFE ACT &amp; kill a cop. UNSAFE
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-04 14:32:32	@NickReisman @NYSRPA Now all we need is Andy next and we can really clean up Albany. Finally NY is heading into the right direction.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-04 14:59:12	@truTVjokers @jamessmurray I will see you guys Sat night at Westbury. Cannot wait.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-05 01:28:36	@Newsday why so quiet? How can a released felon get a gun under the SAFE ACT &amp; kill a cop? Why does this stupid law only target law abiding
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-04 15:02:02	@BrianLehrer @helensmomma @AndreaWNYC Clean sweep of Albany is needed to move NY in the right direction. This is all great news for NYers!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-06 11:15:14	.@NBCNewYork THANK GOD WE HAVE THE SAFE ACT TO KEEP US SAFE FROM THE THUGS OF NY. DONT WE ALL FEEL SAFE HERE?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-06 11:18:26	.@NYSRPA  definition of stupidity. Keep electing the same idiots and expecting different results. Why won't NYers wake up?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-10 16:26:37	@Breaking911 @CeaseCommonCore Time to federalize the death penalty laws. If you kill a cop, you will not get cable TV and dental. You Die!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-10 16:29:41	@SheriffClarke @BearingArmsCom @Cameron_Gray Lets stop giving cop killers cable TV, Dental &amp; Health care. Lets put them to death . Enough!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-10 16:36:22	I think they revoke revoke his pistol license until he takes a firearm course teaching proper safeguard and storage of a firearm
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-10 17:02:58	@truTVjokers #tenderloins  Saw the show Sat @ Westbury. You guys were Great. 2 bad we couldn't get a pic with you. My son and I are big fans
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-12 23:25:27	.@NBCNewYork This is not possible. Must be a lie. We have the #NYSAFEACT. Our governor would never allow bad boys to carry guns.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-12 15:20:21	@NYSRPA @The_Citizen In NY, only the criminal can legally carry while the good guys get disarmed by our failed governor. Crime pays in NY
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-13 11:13:33	@AmyMek @nysafeact The problem is, @Everytown is delusional &amp; thinks the Safe act is a good law. Tell that to Brian Moore's parents!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-13 13:35:46	@truTV @truTVjokers @thetenderloins  You are the funniest people on the planet. Saw you @ westbury sat night and you were awesome. Thanks
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-13 13:40:15	.@li_firearms Makes logical sense to change/repeal. Safe Act has killed more than protected. Time 2 write a law that targets killers &amp; thugs
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-14 13:53:46	@BearingArmsCom In NY, crime does pay. We strengthen gun laws 4 good guys but don't increase sentences for felons. Killing not a deterrent
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-14 16:14:17	@NYSAFE Safe act disarms law abiding &amp; did nothing 2 prevent a released felon from getting a gun &amp; killing a cop. Why is that @NYGovCuomo ??
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-16 11:43:53	@StopFemaNow Increased premiums also because imaginary new ratings such as making a 3ft dirt crawl space a liveable floor. Thanks @Allstate
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-16 11:47:33	@StopFemaNow FEMA Granted my appeal to not include 3ft crawl but @Allstate refuses to follow FEMA RULING. This is why rates go up as well!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-16 14:54:43	@TheHappyPelican @StopFemaNow Do Sandy victims have their life's back 2 normal? R we still fighting magical re rating issues? Ask @Allstate
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-16 14:58:08	@TheHappyPelican @StopFemaNow @Allstate @SenSchumer why is a 3 ft dirt crawl space considered a livable floor? Will they cover top soil???
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-16 15:01:49	@TheHappyPelican @StopFemaNow @Allstate @SenSchumer NYR case manager 4 got about our case. Program expires in June. We might be out of luck
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-16 15:08:16	@TheHappyPelican @StopFemaNow  @SenSchumer I appealed FEMA &amp; they granted by saying crawl not liveable but @Allstate refuses 2 change policy
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-16 16:35:30	@helensmomma Stay strong and don't ever quit. Your strength will prevail. Keep focused and don't ever forget what your fighting for.

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-18 16:54:24	@NYSRPA @DailyCaller Too bad @MikeBloomberg &amp;@Everytown not smart enough to know that law abiding citizens don't shoot cops. They need lives
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-20 13:34:23	.@Newsday I thought you had to be 21 to have a valid pistol permit in NY. I guess they never got the #NYSAFEACT memo. Crime pays in NY #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-20 13:41:43	@StopFemaNow I wonder if falsely rating a home after storm could be called fraudulent. @Allstate not complying with FEMA decision. Now what?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-22 02:23:19	@OptimumHelp Is your web site down? I need some technical assistance with port 80 or any other local ports available to me. Thanks

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-22 02:30:34	@OptimumHelp My firewall had it blocked. Dont know how that happened but i UN blocked, Are there any other active ports?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-22 02:37:05	@OptimumHelp So 80 would be the only port? Resetting is an option. Is that just unplugging power from router?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-22 18:41:38	@Guns_com @GRAAmerica What a great law. Here in NY We don't  need that. We have the #NYSAFEACT &amp; corruptive leaders to protect us. #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-22 20:14:49	@NBCNewYork THANK YOU #NYSAFEACT for PROTECTING US
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-23 01:32:05	@kirkouimet Hi, Can I ask u a few questions about port forwarding tool
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-23 02:12:29	@MamasGotAGun @nysafeact MY son shot air &amp; 22 from 12-18. I volunteered as an RSO. Had a great time. Awesome program to build confidence
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-23 02:16:00	@MamasGotAGun @GRAAmerica @RhondaMcMahon24 I guess the definition of #gunsense is 2 disarm all law abiding &amp; allow gangs and killers 
2 rule
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-23 02:23:27	@MamasGotAGun @nysafeact There were some board of ed members who were against #2A program but in history of program, not 1 accident ever
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-22 11:40:31	@AmyMek @nysafeact And stop re electing the same idiots &amp; expecting different results. That is called lunacy and stupidly. Wake up America
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-23 15:18:06	..@GunOwners Finally a common sense law. 1 for the good guys. I guess all the felons from there will have to come to NY where crime pays
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-23 17:44:15	@GRAAmerica Great article. Firearm safety course teaches DPF, proper cleaning, proper ammo, follow through, trigger control, I recommend
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-23 00:33:42	@noturbine @StopFemaNow NYR set 2 expire in June. No extension yet. Case manager hasn't called in 2 months. Good 2 make them accountable.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-23 00:37:30	@MamasGotAGun @nysafeact  PAL or previously Police boys club teach Olympic style rifle. Excellent program for our youth. I was team RSO
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-22 22:27:32	@BearingArmsCom The day before Sandy, I packed both cars &amp; grabbed all firearms but was more worried cause I had a NY restricted license
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-22 22:40:29	During Evac here in NY 4 Sandy, I was more nervous to pack my guns and take with me cause I have restricted license. https://t.co/7xGQs2BpQy
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-22 22:43:41	@NRA @NRAILA Should a hurricane evacuee be scared to grab their guns? In NY I was more scared cause I have restricted license &amp; cant carry
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-23 02:09:48	@MamasGotAGun @nysafeact for many years now, PAL using public school range so no handguns. Also, 12-18 cannot touch a pistol in NY
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-23 02:21:32	@MamasGotAGun @nysafeact Since our safe act law, Shootings r up because we all have restricted licenses &amp; cant carry. only felons can carry
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-23 02:31:17	@MamasGotAGun @nysafeact Parenting is everything, my son was a junior firefighter &amp; rifle team&amp; he is not out there shooting cops.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-23 02:45:53	@MamasGotAGun @nysafeact RU serious? Why not? Like i always say, in NY, only the felons and thugs can legally carry unrestricted w/ 15 rds
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-23 03:13:43	@GRAAmerica @ATFHQ @markcglaze No Deterrent in NY 2 kill. Judge releases a felon and then he shoots a cop. Only criminals can carry in NY
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-25 19:23:12	@MichelLawyers @NYSRPA In NY, only criminals are allowed to carry to defend themselves. NY not aware that there is a #2A . NY is a disgrace
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-26 12:44:05	.@NYSRPA #2A Actually this a great law. What better than to mandate gangs to install safes in their clubhouses. Brilliant thinking @NYAGV1
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-26 12:51:46	.@NBCNewYork You would think NBC would start questioning Y we have the Safe act which has made nobody safe. A failed law &amp; U  remain silent
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-26 14:09:40	@Newsday Your report must be wrong. We have the safe act. We have no illegal guns in NY. I am sure they have pistol permits. Get the facts!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-26 14:28:08	@GunOwners We already have this law in NY. Felons and gangs allowed to open carry wherever they want. Only law abiding can't carry #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-26 17:04:50	@SteveMcNY @CuomoWatch I always ask @Newsday @NBCNewYork @News12LI why they never question a law that has failed &amp; only targets law abiding
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-26 17:17:45	@CuomoWatch @nypost LOL,not surprising that @NYGovCuomo will never admit his safeact is a failure so now we put NYSP in the city. A joke
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-26 19:58:55	@guntruth @GRAAmerica The most dangerous environment 4 a law abiding citizen is a gun free zone. To disarm me makes me prey for a killer!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-27 21:45:14	@xbr8208gold @GunOwners Cops put them away, judges let them out. Where does a felon get a gun? Not your local gun store. safe act kills!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-27 21:52:09	@NBCNewYork Does NBC ever wonder why the states with the most restrictive gun laws cannot prevent shootings? NY&amp;NJ should be ashamed. #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-28 00:04:05	@murphydan @GRAAmerica @chucklindell Not NYC, lol, we have enough morons running NY and voters who put them right back in office. Dumb
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-28 12:49:24	@StopFemaNow How many increases due 2 insurance companies re rating &amp; adding stories U never had. @Allstate got creative w/floors. Disgrace
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-28 13:26:46	@DrewScott12 @News12LI 5-10 years minimum and permanent loss of license and should have to compensate the victim
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-28 14:23:31	@USACarry IN NY, you cannot purchase online so we are forced to shop locally where gun stores mark up ammo &amp; they will not sell you bulk.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-28 14:53:54	@DrewScott12 @News12LI My auto insurance went up again 4 no reason. @Allstate told me NYS took another rate increase. Who am I paying for?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-28 16:08:02	@RollingStone @RondaRousey She is beautiful!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-28 16:21:06	@kirkouimet Hi, I was trying 2 see if port 80 was open or not. I fixed problem through cable provider settings. For now ok.Thanks 4 replying
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-28 16:29:47	@NRA @GRAAmerica @KatiePavlich At least we know 1 fact, killers and criminals support more gun control. Nothing like protecting the killers!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-28 20:52:20	.@GunOwners Why is it the law abiding R the only ones who know the definition of gun control. The act of Aiding &amp; Abetting known criminals
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-29 00:33:23	@conserv_tribune Thanks to her ridiculous ideas, schools can only serve wheat and healthy foods. All the kids leave and get fast food. Duh
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-29 00:38:15	@_NewYork_News_ @CuomoWatch Who would have thought I would live in a state run by crooks &amp; idiots. I don't blame the idiots. Only the voters
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-29 00:45:50	@BearingArmsCom I guess the citizens get what they vote or deserve. Disarmed public wants guns &amp; cops. Maybe in 2016 they will vote awake
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-29 13:49:29	@Newsday Don't U have anything else to print? Why are U silent on the #NYSAFEACT &amp;  its failure 2 protect anybody? Increased shootings. #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-29 16:21:45	@GRAAmerica @BreitbartNews Thank You @MomsDemand 4 cleaning up the streets &amp; keeping those felons &amp; killers safe from us law abiding. #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-29 11:31:08	@NBCNewYork @NYSAFE @NY2Agrassroots How is this even possible NBC? We have the safe act. R U not aware of this? Time 2 do your job &amp; report
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-30 02:38:23	@MercyMercyf @CarlHeastie @maslowsneeds @helensmomma @claudiatenney Great article &amp; video. NY is a disgrace. Corruption is their priority
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-30 13:32:08	@danielkh62 @Everytown @shannonwatts @billmaher you lost me there. Not sure what your point is. Gun laws only control the good guys. #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-30 12:06:31	@li_firearms I do hope that #NotOneMore means no more felons &amp; killers getting released from prison 2 kill again. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-30 13:08:47	@danielkh62 @Everytown @shannonwatts @billmaher Gun laws only work if the gangs and killers apply for pistol licenses. #2A #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-30 17:44:09	@NBCNewYork I cannot believe this. NY &amp; NJ have the toughest gun laws and yet people still getting shot. Go figure. #gunowners  #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-30 17:47:04	@Newsday Wow, I guess the safe act was only meant for us law abiding who do follow laws. NY is pathetic. #gunowners @NYGovCuomo #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-29 22:18:49	@guntruth @GRAAmerica #2A #gunowners Not a bad idea, but how can you force the felons and gangs to purchase? Can they purchase in prison?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-30 17:41:55	@NBCNewYork #gunowners #2A I thought we had the safe act. You mean the thugs &amp; killers R not abiding by the states toughest gun laws??
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-30 21:50:30	@GRAANH @GRAAmerica What makes @MomsDemand so less credible is they R arguing about a law effecting law abiding. Not one concern 4 killers!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-05-31 14:07:33	@Pa2ed @CuomoWatch #gunsense #gunowners 2 bad @MomsDemand &amp; @NYAGV1 only concerned about law abiding. They don't care about criminals #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-01 11:20:58	@NBCNewYork @NY2Agrassroots Did someone say safe act? You mean @NYGovCuomo has not made the streets of NY any safer? NY is more Unsafe!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-01 13:19:15	@BearingArmsCom #gunowners #2A @RepMaloney I bet the Felons &amp; killers love her. She is not fighting crime, she is harassing law abiding, Sad
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-01 13:24:48	@News12LI #gunowners #2A I hope he has his pistol license suspended. How many rounds were in the magazine? Will he be charged under safe act
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-03 10:54:26	@NYSAFE That is actually very disturbing. Changes many attitudes and opinions about them. Obviously supporters of gangs and killers. Sad!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-03 11:03:23	@GRAAmerica @GeraldoRivera Amazing how these anti idiots think wanting to protect yourself is wrong &amp; blame us 4 the fall of society. A joke
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-03 11:06:07	@AmyMek @nysafeact @ESPYS As long as groups like @MomsDemand &amp; @NYAGV1 blame us for the acts of killers, there credibility diminishes daily!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-02 11:21:36	@NBCNewYork #gunowners #2A How could someone w/a pistol license commit such a crime? Did he not get @NYGovCuomo safe act memo?  Poor Bad Guy
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-02 11:40:15	@NYSRPA #gunowners #2A I think it's time 4 @NYGovCuomo to admit his law is a failure &amp; his intent was only 2 bully law abiding citizens
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-02 12:17:59	@sandifield @StopFemaNow Talk about salt in wound. Before Sandy, my house was 1 story. After Sandy, @Allstate rating as 2 story w/ no stairs
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-02 13:30:35	@AppSame @TheHappyPelican Either totally delusional or a legend in his own mind., LOL
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-03 13:06:53	@Guns_com @GRAAmerica The reason 4 little interest is because @RepMaloney is not a crime fighter, she is a law abiding hater. People R tired
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-03 21:44:55	@guntruth @GRAAmerica I think the majority of the country gets this but @MomsDemand @NYAGV1 &amp; @MikeBloomberg R living in their own world
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-04 18:09:29	@NYSRPA @BreitbartNews Groups like @MomsDemand &amp; @Everytown R never upfront about their cause. They should be every town for gang violence
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-04 18:24:37	@GunOwners #gunowners #2A Facts R Facts, the only thing that sparks more violence is the disarmament of innocent law abiding civilians.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-04 18:30:29	She is awesome. Would love too ask her out. https://t.co/SIXFi7KMHk
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-04 18:35:35	@Newsday @7eleven #gunsense #gunowners #2A @GunOwners  Another armed robbery under @NYGovCuomo &amp; his safe act. Time 2 repeal a failed law!!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-04 18:40:09	@Guns_com @GRAAmerica Hard 2 believe a NY baseball player doesn't know former mayor @MikeBloomberg &amp; his hatred 4 law abiding gun owners!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-04 18:53:56	@2AFDN @CCRKBArms What an embarrassment to congress she must be. With all the violence in the world, lets blame law abiding citizens! Joke
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-03 16:20:19	@1Marchella @TheHappyPelican You R correct. Would @MikeBloomberg ever walk the streets alone? People are listening to him much less lately
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-04 21:24:38	@BearingArmsCom #gunowners @GunOwners #2A I think that is what they meant by #gunsense .In NY, carjacking would be legal &amp; she 'd  be jailed
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-04 21:35:21	@CCRKBArms @GunOwners #gunowners #2A financial wise he is very smart but he is a big supporter of criminals &amp; gangs. He hates gun owners!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-03 18:10:51	@GOPLdrBrianKolb @helensmomma NYers R in we'll need of some change. Our leaders more concerned about kickbacks than trying 2 make NY great!

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-03 22:14:48	@GRAAmerica @guntruth Thanks to @NYGovCuomo the gun laws in NY are lenient 4 killers and gangs. He is making those streets safe for them
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-05 12:05:26	@truTVjokers @Joe_Gatto HAPPY BIRTHDAY LARRY. You are the best.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-05 13:05:55	@Conservativeind @nysafeact @EricReedGRAA Nassau County takes 4-6 months &amp; they warn you not 2 call. They don't want u rushing them at all!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-04 11:13:03	@News12LI Did they check the validity of their pistol licenses and how many rounds were in chamber?
Sorry, that is only done to law abiding
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-04 12:01:55	@NYSRPA #gunowners #2A 2 bad @NYGovCuomo is not an honest guy. Just admit your attack on law abiding failed &amp; go after the gangs &amp; killers
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-04 12:14:29	@Newsday #gunowners #2A @GunOwners So how has the safe act made us safe? Why is Newsday silent on the issue? A failed law &amp; your silent. Why
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-04 12:18:32	@StopFEMANowUNY @StopFemaNow @StopFEMAnowTX Premiums also go up for magical reratings by @Allstate. How can I have a 2 story w/ no stairs
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-04 13:03:02	@sandifield @StopFemaNow Sad &amp; disgraceful but Also innocent until proven guilty. If guilty, they should face the max &amp;have to repay all $$$
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-05 17:21:48	@SebastianSNBQ @BearingArmsCom I think by now, everyone should know @Everytown &amp; @MomsDemand R only about attacking law abiding gun owners!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-05 17:45:29	@Amy_Reimann @truTVjokers what makes these guys great is there the real deal. Saw them live @ Westbury and they have the best personalities
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-05 18:30:00	@News12Andrew @News12LI So why don't u ask @NYGovCuomo why he spends all his time going after law abiding citizens &amp; not gangs &amp; killers??
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-04 14:19:59	@Newsday @NYGovCuomo #gunowners @GunOwners #2A so let's see, we have 2 add another 3 lives lost under the @NYSAFE  Act! How do we explain??
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-06 13:18:47	@GRAAmerica @NewtownAction The word is brainwashing. Gun control has &amp; never will work because violent criminals &amp; gangs are excluded #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-05 18:55:17	@NYSRPA All these anti gun groups R losing credibility. They never address gangs &amp; criminals. They only want 2 disarm law abiding citizens
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-06 18:18:53	@GunOwners I never understood Y we have federal laws to begin with. Gangs &amp; criminals don't apply 4 pistol licenses. Only law abiding #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-06 18:23:08	@helensmomma @albanyproject Not possible. We R in the most honest state in the nation. Lol. Elected officials in NY have integrity &amp;loyalty
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-06 18:30:45	@StopFemaNow @AsburyParkPress @jeanmikle I have been very satisfied with NYLAG. They r very knowledgeable &amp; thorough. Best decision I made
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-06 18:49:05	@li_firearms Wow, 51 pages. When I renewed my PA non res LTC, there wasn't any handbook. Does NCPD mail them to gang clubhouses &amp; prisons
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-06 19:49:44	@helensmomma @albanyproject NYers R so desperate for a new regime w/ standards of integrity. We r all losing while we wait 4 his indictment
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-07 21:11:37	@li_firearms Gangs not a big concern in NY.Nobody cares. But Nassau PD revised a new 51 page pistol Manuel for non criminals. How dumb. #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-07 21:15:01	@CuomoWatch What makes these 2 felons any different than all the other killings that take place in NY? Gangs kill all the time. Why pay $$$
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-07 21:17:59	@NYSRPA @BreitbartNews Why did Nassau PD revise a new 51 page pistol Manuel including safe act law. This book never mentioned killers/gangs!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-07 21:24:47	@CuomoWatch Yes that's true. I wonder where the $$ will come from. We don't even offer that 4 shot cops. I thought he supported felons in NY
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-08 01:12:59	@NYSAFE @CuomoWatch Too bad they can't separate NYC from rest of state. I mean they did vote 4 him. Did they expect something new this time?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-08 12:06:30	@NBCNewYork The NY safe act was supposed 2 make us law abiding safe. @NYGovCuomo stands proud of his law while people getting shot. #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-08 12:08:48	@NBCNewYork Did someone say safe act?? What has this failed law done to improve NY?? @NYGovCuomo has failed at his task. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-08 12:13:05	@NYSAFE @NY2Agrassroots #gunowners #2a @nysafeact NCPD revises new 51 page pistol Manuel. Why? Gangs &amp; felons not included in this new book!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-08 12:22:47	@NYSAFE @NY2Agrassroots #gunowners #2A  nysafeact NCPD revises new 51 page pistol Manuel. Why? Gangs &amp; felons not included in this new book!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-08 12:39:32	@NYSAFE @NY2Agrassroots @nysafeact  Nassau County Pistol Handbook Revised May 21, 2015 http://t.co/dyxqGB3cUc
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-08 12:45:04	@NYSAFE @NY2Agrassroots @nysafeact I was also advised that Nassau PD will actually remove the word "Carry" on a restricted license.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-08 13:38:13	@NYSRPA #gunowners #2A But if you ask @NYGovCuomo, he still stands by Law while shootings rise. @NBCNewYork @Newsday &amp;@News12LI also silent!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-08 16:14:27	@katcreag4NY @NBCNewYork Shootings will not stop in NY until @NYGovCuomo repeals the safe act and goes after real criminals. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-08 16:32:16	@NRA @NRAILA #gunowners #2A R U aware that Nassau PDNY revised a new pistol handbook 51 pages reflecting safe act &amp;new guidelines? Pathetic
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-08 16:36:01	@li_firearms Have you heard anything about Nassau PD removing the word "Carry" from restricted licenses? Heard this at a gun store Sunday
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-08 19:07:25	@JimmyVielkind @CuomoWatch With shootings up in NY, minimal tweaking not enough. Gangs &amp; killers should not be exempt from law. #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-08 20:00:16	@GunOwners If someone votes 4 a candidate with a specific ideology &amp; the constituents R not happy. Where is logic in reelection? #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-09 13:03:21	@GannettAlbany @CuomoWatch @DandC Of course these small changes R a start 4 a failed law but what effect will it have on reducing shootings
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-09 13:08:36	@NYSRPA Will these small changes reduce the already skyrocketing shootings. Entire law needs repealing. #gunowners #2A #NYSAFEACT
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-08 23:37:44	@Credico2016 @CuomoWatch @NYGovCuomo @LionelMedia @fud31 @ZackFinkNews Anytime you disarm your society, you facilitate the mind of a killer
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-08 23:43:37	@greta @FoxNews Y is @NYGovCuomo so concerned about escapees when gangs &amp; killers kill everyday in NY &amp; his only recourse is the safe act?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-09 14:12:54	@CuomoWatch @JCEvangelist_TU @NYAGV1 @NY2Agrassroots @NYSRPA I think that is a great idea. Gangs&amp;killers should have to safeguard their guns
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-09 14:32:09	@phillydotcom @GRAAmerica @GovChristie Great story but not convinced that he supports gun rights. NJ has tough gun laws&amp;highest crime. #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-09 21:02:10	@NBCNewYork Another shooting under @NYGovCuomo #NYSAFEACT ? Thanks god these criminals don't have to follow the same laws. #gunowners  #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-09 14:52:28	@Tahawus506 @CuomoWatch @HoldFast33 @JCEvangelist_TU @NYAGV1 @NY2Agrassroots That's Y gangs&amp;killers love government 4 being on their side!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-09 14:55:40	@GOPLdrBrianKolb @MercyMercyf Our leaders get stupid on common sense laws but useless laws like #NYSAFEACT they pass. No credibility #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-09 15:11:09	@MercyMercyf @GOPLdrBrianKolb like I always say. @NYGovCuomo best supporters R the gangs &amp;felons who don't follow the laws. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-10 13:02:09	@News12LI You mean the perps didn't adhere to the strict Suffolk County gun laws? I forgot, only the law abiding do that. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-10 13:12:48	@Rob__Base @KingAndrewCuomo @StrictlyBenjis Yes I agree, LoL. Safe act 2 should include required head gear when defending yourself. #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-10 13:17:21	@LeahTweetr @NY2Agrassroots @CuomoWatch It would be hard 2 imagine them leaving NY. They R safer here with safe act. Y go to a pro gun state
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-09 15:45:56	@MercyMercyf @GOPLdrBrianKolb @NYGovCuomo @MikeBloomberg hates #gunowners but prob has more security than Eminem or Rihanna, lol #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-10 13:41:35	#2A @CuomoWatch #NYSAFEACT  @nysafeact @NY2Agrassroots U think if Obama prohibits our free speech about guns, Twitter will shutdown , LOL
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-10 14:17:28	@Newsday What gang was she associated with? Will she be able to plea to a lesser charge like disorderly conduct? Slap on wrist. #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-09 16:56:53	@NYSRPA @timesunion the brilliance of stupidity. How will this reduce the increased shootings in NY? More brainless politicians. #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-09 18:15:43	@News12LI Is it really about overtime orR they trying to keep the jails empty for all the law abiding gun owners who violate #NYSAFEACT #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 00:01:09	@TishJames Safe act posed a harmful threat 2 law abiding gun owners. Gang members &amp; killers do not apply 4 pistol licenses. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 00:04:41	@bradhoylman @NYSenate @NYGovCuomo The fact is that the failed safe act has nothing 2 do with gun violence. More shootings now since 2013
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 00:05:54	@NYSAFE @NY2Agrassroots @nysafeact did you get the link I sent you. The pistol handbook revised
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 00:10:35	@nysafeact @ChrisMurphyCT We have 2 thanks @Everytown @NYAGV1 @MomsDemand 4 making streets safer for gangs and killers . #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 00:13:52	@NYAGV1 Unfortunately, your theory would be great if the gangs &amp; killers applied 4 pistol licenses and complied w/ all laws. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 00:19:26	@oldsoldier181 U wonder why @NYAGV1 @Everytown @MomsDemand R silent about officer killed under safe act &amp; all the other daily shootings #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 21:55:49	@NYDNHammond @CuomoWatch @joshrobin Would be in every constituents best interest if he did. Then maybe we can move NY into the future!!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 21:59:35	@conserv_tribune Because of her, majority of students eat outside of school. You think they want wheat in everything they eat? Very sad
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-12 00:27:52	@GRAATexas @GRAAmerica Nassau County NY schools all had rifle teams yrs back. Still have Nassau PD PAL Rifle team. My son started at 12 yrs
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-10 18:14:48	@SteveMcNY @CuomoWatch Would be nice to pay 100 grand to the NYR case managers who R asleep on the job. Their work is equivalent 2 a turtle
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-12 01:36:49	@conserv_tribune still confusing. Who decided 2 bury in adult section anyway? Someone must have taken her money 4 burial &amp;not explained rule
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-12 01:41:01	@2ANow @GRAAmerica @MomsDemand Great story and great youth sport. Unfortunately #gunsense is defined as only gangs &amp; thugs R allowed 2 carry
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-10 21:40:28	@ShepNewsTeam Y does government try to disarm its law abiding gun owners &amp; put us in harms way. What type of agenda is that? #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 12:03:02	@NYSRPA @BreitbartNews More dumb laws that will never prevent a crime. How much more killing is needed by gangs/criminals. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 12:08:53	@NBCNewYork Gun control works so well. When will @MomsDemand @Everytown @NYAGV1 wake up. Criminals don't follow laws. We do! #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 12:34:30	@NYSAFE @NY2Agrassroots @nysafeact ok thanks
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-12 12:53:59	@2ANow Groups like @Everytown @MomsDemand R A fraud. Y would they not support lawful carry to defend against killers? #gunowners #Gunsense
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 14:06:20	@ANYAGV2 @NYAGV1 U wonder why groups like @MomsDemand @Everytown love gang violence. They have no credibility. Why disarm law abiding? #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 15:16:12	@nicolefuller @Newsday @QueensDABrown So 1 would have 2 ask Y a city with toughest gun laws, does nothing 2 prevent crime. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 15:47:33	@kevinpost @nysafeact Ideology of @MomsDemand #gunsense is 2 let the gangs/killers run around shooting everyone &amp; disarm law abiding. #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 15:51:06	@NBCNewYork I thought stun guns for civilian use were illegal in NY. Don't you love the way these strict laws deter thugs. #2A #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 18:06:02	@phil_oliva @CuomoWatch @NYGovCuomo I am quite sure with the pressure from @MomsDemand &amp; @Everytown , the good guy better have a full carry!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 18:35:39	@NYSRPA @addthis Its a shame that @MomsDemand &amp; @Everytown R not smart enough to see these facts. Law abiding R not the problem. #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-13 00:34:39	@2AFight U wonder Y @MomsDemand @Everytown don't protest in front of gang clubhouses?Is it because they R A fraud? #GunSense #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-13 00:37:55	@Bradybuzz @AMJPublicHealth Explain how it saves lives when gangs &amp; killers don't apply 4 pistol licenses? Duh. #GunSense #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-13 00:41:23	@nysafeact I wonder Y @MomsDemand @Everytown don't protest gang violence but they protest peaceful carry. FRAUD? #GunSense #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-13 00:43:53	@Bradybuzz @senatorjacqui I would think the fight would start at every gang clubhouse. #GunSense promotes violence &amp; kills! #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-13 01:15:56	@2ANow Would you rather live next door to a peaceful law abiding gun owner or a gang clubhouse. Would love 2 ask @MomsDemand @Everytown #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 01:46:09	@jonathan4ny @NBCNewYork let's see. Maybe a disgruntled  armed security officer? Or auditioning 4 BGT? Or just a moron. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 02:24:36	@Pa2ed @NYSDigitalCop @CuomoWatch I just saw that @MomsDemand blocked me.Never said anything bad 2 them. I just tweet truth.Sad! #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 02:27:26	@Pa2ed @CuomoWatch @NYSDigitalCop I don't look 4 trouble. I can't carry in Nassau anyway. Hard 2 imagine being prosecuted 4 having 10 @ home
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 02:36:33	@Pa2ed license is "to &amp; from range only. NCPD just revised a new 51 pistol Manuel 4 us Law abiding. Makes me nauseous. Have a full PA LTC
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 02:37:36	@Pa2ed #iamblockedbymomsdemand I guess I am a new member of the club, lol They block a peaceful guy like me &amp; probably follow the gangs. Sad
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 23:38:29	@newyorklivetv @NBCNewYork @TheRoscoeDiner been there a few times. Great food and nice people. Passing through on the way to Delhi
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-11 23:59:59	@jeffdunham When are you coming to Long Island? We miss you. Can't wait to see you.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-13 23:10:54	@Pa2ed @CuomoWatch I actually still keep 10 rds in my guns at home for protection. Once I put 3 rds into an intruders, I am legal again, lol
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-13 23:21:17	@News12LI unfortunately, it was never priority 4 @NYGovCuomo 2 go after gang violence. He only targets law abiding. #gunowners #GunSense #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-13 23:24:23	@2ANow I would join @MomsDemand  if they could get the gangs 2 use trigger locks 4 our safety. That would impress. #gunowners #gunsense #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-13 23:28:09	@albanyproject @CuomoWatch They R raising big money &amp;many empty storefronts in my town. People can't afford rent for small businesses. Sad!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 18:31:30	@2ANow @Everytown Well we know  @MikeBloomberg has security. Probably more than Eminem! A man that hates law abiding, does he hire felons?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-12 13:45:18	@GunOwners Should be a clear case of self defense. I recommend an inexpensive surveillance system installed 4 any gun owner. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 00:20:46	@2ANow @Everytown I sure hope that protest is @ an MS13 clubhouse on Long Island. @MomsDemand should be asking gangs 2 register their guns!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 00:24:21	@MomsPretend @nysafeact @RichardH0well @mjcastro360 If @MomsDemand @Everytown were legit,they would be marching in front of gang clubhouses
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 00:27:23	@RichardH0well @nysafeact Pathetic that @MikeBloomberg @Everytown never talk about getting rid of gangs but protest lawful &amp; peaceful carry!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 00:30:12	@RichardH0well @nysafeact @MikeBloomberg @Everytown Their purpose is a fraud &amp; everyone knows it. They will not target killers &amp; gangs. Why?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 00:36:53	@RichardH0well @nysafeact @MikeBloomberg @Everytown That is how @NYGovCuomo won. All the inmates &amp; gangs voted 4 him. They love the safeact
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 00:33:59	@beforeitsnews @GRAAmerica These senators obviously mentally impaired 2 introduce more gun restrictions on law abiding  #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 00:39:24	Do U think @MomsDemand @Everytown @NYAGV1 will ever stop flapping their mouths &amp; take a stand against gangs in NY? #gunowners #GunSense #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-13 13:19:29	@NBCNewYork Wow 19 yrs old &amp; shooting @ cops. Where did he get gun? Thanks god he is supported by @MomsDemand @Everytown . #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-13 13:23:28	@greta You would think a police station is a gun free zone. So Y didn't they follow law? R gun free zones safe? Do they work? #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-12 15:49:24	@GunOwners What we do have an increase in, is Mass lack of parenting! #gunowners not the issue. Poor family values are. #Gunsense  #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-12 15:51:55	@pinkartgurl59 @TheHappyPelican Unfortunately, we have too many Americans asleep at the wheel who think she will show honesty if elected!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-12 19:14:02	@GunOwners I guess that is what U call #Gunsense . Just another story that @momsdemand @Everytown will not comment about. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 00:48:11	@ProGunOwner @CuomoWatch @Pa2ed I carry 10 in my house. I have a "bedroom 2 kitchen only" or is that a "to &amp; from range only" lol sorry #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 00:55:10	@CuomoWatch @NYSDigitalCop @Pa2ed I am quite sure NCPD will suspend a license 4 a violation of safe act. Nassau not pro gun. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 01:08:01	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @NY2Agrassroots #gunsense #gunowners #2A Just another safe day in the safest city in the world!!  http://t.co/n5aSJB6W22
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 01:55:49	@2ANow Has @Everytown @MomsDemand actually done anything positive 2 combat gangs &amp; killers? That would be 2 credible. #gunowners #GunSense
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 02:00:42	@hvukkdalibrl2dy @2ANow @DuffelBlog @TedHellerTravel R U serious? Is that a wedding party boat or the Navy? Time 2 get the sailors twirlers
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 02:18:50	@2ANow I just saw that @MomsDemand has blocked me. Lol. Y? Cause law abiding gun owners talk the truth &amp;that scares them? #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 02:29:28	@Pa2ed @NYSDigitalCop @CuomoWatch @MomsDemand R they that delusional 2 believe we R against them. I just want them 2 target gangs &amp; killers
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-12 19:21:40	@Victoriaokane no problem
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-12 20:29:47	@NRA @GRAAmerica Another great story that @MomsDemand @Everytown don't comment about. This is the definition of #GunSense #ArmedCitizen #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 09:17:38	@NBCNewYork Another beautiful night in Brooklyn! That safe act working well. Thanks 2 our leaders who passed it. #gunowners #GunSense #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 11:04:54	@NBCNewYork There is no rent control in Nassau County TOH. Nobody ever cared about tenants in Nassau. We are all losing in NY. 8.625% Sad
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 11:12:40	@2ANow @MikeBloomberg My son was on a rifle team @12. He did just fine. Builds self esteem &amp;discipline. Maybe Mike meant gangs. #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 12:01:29	@BrowncoatLex @CuomoWatch @tuckahoetommy Gangs in NY got it made. There not subject 2 any capacity &amp; can carry unrestricted. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 12:05:56	@SteveMcNY @CuomoWatch @tuckahoetommy Nobody will ever know what they need but as long as criminals can legally carry in NY, I want the max!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 12:09:45	@News12LI Another beautifully safe day in Nassau. These home invaders didn't get @NYGovCuomo #NYSAFEACT memo. A shame! #gunowners #Gunsense
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 17:14:06	@2ANow @Everytown 4 get about mass shootings. I hasn't even stopped every day shootings. Killers love gun control. #gunowners #GunSense #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 18:41:39	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE Gun store in Nassau says if I buy a new Glock, it comes w/ 2 15rd. He cannot give 2 me so I have 2 buy 2 10's, more $$$?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 18:45:33	@StopfemanowLBNY @StopFemaNow @StopFEMAnowLINY @fema In all fairness, duplication of benefits is not legal. People did scam to get more $$$
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 18:48:03	@StopfemanowLBNY @StopFemaNow @StopFEMAnowLINY @fema Also, only one applicant per household can apply 4 DA. If someone scams , less 4 U &amp; me
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 18:56:51	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE yeah I know. Maybe about 65.00 for 2 mags. Wanna trade in my 19 for a gen 4 but have to give my old 10's w/ trade in.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 19:04:53	@GunOwners If @MomsDemand @Everytown were truly committed 2 reducing crime &amp; worked with us, the gangs would have 2 relocate. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-14 22:00:14	@sharfie68 @NYSAFE @tuckahoetommy @CuomoWatch @SteveMcNY Sad that our rights R denied &amp; MS13 rules Long Island. They have more protection!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 00:55:27	@julsk_21 @GunOwners @MomsDemand @Everytown Long Island has no carry. "2&amp;from range permit only". NY only allows criminals &amp; gangs 2 carry
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 13:48:34	@tuckahoetommy @SteveMcNY @CuomoWatch You need 2 have a governor who is adamant about reducing crime. Not punishing law abiding. #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 13:51:31	@tuckahoetommy @SteveMcNY @CuomoWatch groups like @Everytown @MomsDemand support a gov that has no interest in going after gangs. #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 14:32:54	@NYSRPA @dcexaminer I don't think mike would switch gears. He might piss off the gangs&amp;killers he represents. #gunowners #Gunsense #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 15:14:54	@NBCNewYork We have 2 ask @NYGovCuomo @SenatorSkelos why #NYSAFEACT has failed. Y pass a law to harass law abiding? #gunowners #Gunsense #2A

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 16:42:11	@GunOwners Sounds like #Gunsense 2 me. Give the taxi driver a medal.Did he hav a business or security guard carry.Oh, that's NY. #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 19:47:36	@GOPLdrBrianKolb @helensmomma What do you mean this week, lol.
I don't remember the last time they ever worked with their constituents!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 19:03:26	@GunOwners I live near Elmont where the home invasion occurred. Guns R not a want but a necessity. Arm yourself! #gunowners #Gunsense #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 19:08:39	@2ANow He is still a believer that more gun control will deter gangs and make them good citizens. Draconian thinking. #Gunsense #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-16 16:34:15	@helensmomma @MercyMercyf @JoshDurso With cutting staff@ prisons&amp;safe act. There should be a level of liability 4 putting citizens in danger
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 19:37:32	@NBCNewYork unfortunately, there R morons like this individual that make us look bad. If he has a license, say goodbye 2 it. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 20:49:45	@NBCNewYork DID SOMEONE SAY SAFE ACT? Tell @NYGovCuomo @SenatorSkelos  their law failed &amp; they made NY more unsafe. #Gunsense #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 21:07:09	@2ANow I never joined NRA just 2 join.I believe in promoting youth sports, safety &amp;discipline. I became an RSO 2 educate others. #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 21:10:12	@2ANow Would This sign have worked on the home invasion in Elmont? Would the invaders  have followed the law? Does the safe act deter? #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-16 18:35:44	@2ANow If they had a legit cause, they wouldn't be blocking their account from law abiding gun owners! @Everytown  @MomsDemand #gunowners

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 23:23:16	@Everytown Explain how there was a violent home invasion in Elmont L.I. With the safe act? Criminals don't register firearms. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 23:27:47	Y does @Everytown ignore logic. Y does @MomsDemand block me from their account but flap their mouths about unrealistic ideas? #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 23:33:35	@Newsday This is a sad case of poor parenting. DPF is justified in NY 4 arson.This idiot could've been legally shot 4 stupidity. #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-15 23:58:55	@shieldmaidn @nysafeact #gunsense @Everytown #gunowners #2A  I wonder how background checks worked 4 these 3 women?   http://t.co/TBdfVgOSRo
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-16 00:02:05	@SteveMcNY @CuomoWatch  Let @NYGovCuomo  @SenatorSkelos  know that their safe act did nothing 4 these 3 girls. #2A  http://t.co/TBdfVgOSRo
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-16 00:04:59	@SteveMcNY @CuomoWatch Hard 2 believe @NYGovCuomo @SenatorSkelos think so little of their constituents to give home invaders the upper hand!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-16 00:27:44	@CuomoWatch @nypost Yet with all this crime, @Everytown posts unrelated junk. @MomsDemand blocks everyone. Nobody protesting @NYGovCuomo #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-16 00:36:52	@CuomoWatch @nypost  Funniest things is a law abiding gun owner w/a Nassau license cannot enter NYC limits.But criminals can! #gunsense #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-16 00:40:13	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @NY2Agrassroots #gunsense #gunowners #2A Tell @NYGovCuomo to send this article to Elmont women    http://t.co/Lra3ICxC6C
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-16 00:57:17	@CuomoWatch @NYSAFE @NY2Agrassroots @2ANow #gunowners #2A  I don't think gangs R treated like this In NY or NJ. Sad

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-16 16:43:53	@helensmomma @MercyMercyf @JoshDurso Better question: is a gov of a state indemnified if his actions result in loss of life. Reckless laws?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-16 19:49:58	@conserv_tribune something looks wrong with that picture. We R definitely losing America. Let's hope in 2016, we elect an American President
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 13:47:49	@NYSRPA @DailyFreeman The sole purpose of repeal would be because it has not prevented shootings at all. Criminals don't follow laws. #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 13:54:41	@MercyMercyf @RobAstorino @CuomoWatch Start up NY, NY Rising,Safeact, all failed ideas. Hard to trust a new plan when all has gone downhill
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 15:14:17	@GunOwners How about dumb voters who elect dumb politician incumbents &amp; wonder Y they do the same dumb things. #gunowners #2A @RobAstorino
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 15:21:28	@NBCNewYork Article didn't indicate if the robber had a pistol permit or if he was are that  @NYGovCuomo passed the safe act. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 15:25:55	@Everytown Lets see, If a law abiding gun owner is an extremist, what do we call a person that executes a cop?? #gunowners #Gunsense #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 16:11:56	@GunOwners Another Webster definition of #gunsense &amp; #NotOneMore  Thank god there was a good guy with a gun 2 stop a bad guy. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 16:28:40	@5_centsplease @GRAAmerica @FoxCT unfortunately, the only thing gun laws do is provide a sense of security 4 our criminals. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 16:39:28	@HarryThetech76 @nysafeact @kharyp How can you infringe on a peaceful person but endorse &amp; encourage killers &amp; gangs 2 kill? @Everytown #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 16:54:21	@HarryThetech76 @nysafeact @kharyp @Everytown I'm quite sure these killers &amp;gangs R covered under OSHA laws.That's Y they get great lawyers
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 17:00:05	@kharyp honestly I did skim. Didn't realize but either way point is still made that criminals do get a safe clearance 2 kill by our gov
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 17:11:07	@HarryThetech76 @nysafeact @kharyp All my remarks were toward @Everytown for trying 2 infringe on law abiding citizens &amp; not target gangs.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 17:23:32	@kharyp Gun control has &amp; will always fail because criminals &amp; gangs  don't wait 2 hours on line for a pistol license application like I do
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 17:26:17	@kharyp This was sad &amp; unfortunate. You cannot explain these acts of violence. But it is not a gun issue. What if it were a machete!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 17:28:22	@kharyp Well u R false on that. In NY we have the safe act where shootings have probably doubled &amp; we have strictest background checks here
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 17:31:50	@kharyp Nassau County PD has a 6 month waiting period 4 a restricted license&amp; gangs pretty much rule on violence here with drive by killing
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 17:34:53	@paulh21676 @kharyp I agree on that but when you have a government that tries 2 disarm its citizens &amp; not the criminals. That's a concern
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 17:43:14	@kharyp No.History shows that people will always get illegal guns similar 2 what our gov did in fast &amp;furious.Just want 2 protect ourselves
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 17:48:35	@KittyOn28 @kharyp the bottom line is U can't blame law abiding for acts of criminals. in NY, there is no deterrent to kill. Safe act failed
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 17:51:31	@cualquieratrece @kharyp I just want to protect my family. Many home invasions on Long Island. Like I said. Criminals laugh at safe act
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 17:53:43	@KittyOn28 U R so wrong. @Everytown sole purpose is to increase gun laws that we already have. Let @MomsDemand protest gang clubhouses here
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 17:55:01	@cualquieratrece @kharyp well I waited 6 months for a background check. We do have that here. My son will also wait 6 months when he is 21
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 17:57:27	@cualquieratrece @kharyp I do believe in gun laws but not a government that looks the other way when gun laws have failed over &amp; over
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 17:59:18	@cualquieratrece @kharyp everyone except our leaders. Since safe act, shootings have increased but media &amp; @Everytown R silent. Why??
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 18:01:44	@KittyOn28 Don't be disrespectful and talk stupid. You make no sense. Nobody disrespected u. I don't whine. Just state facts
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 18:03:12	@cualquieratrece @kharyp that's your perspective. I feel better knowing my son and I can defend if needed. Hopefully never have to
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 18:05:51	@KittyOn28 I never called u a whiner. When did I do that
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 18:08:22	@kharyp my concern is government passing more laws that don't work. Safe act reinforced already laws on the books.Criminals don't follow law
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 18:12:15	@cualquieratrece @shauskins @kharyp I believe in education, safety &amp; training. Everyone in my household is licensed &amp; trained .
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 18:14:10	@kharyp well nobody does away with anything. Laws r enhanced. We have speed cameras now thanks to government, lol
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 18:15:37	@KittyOn28 no. You said I was whining. We all have a right to our opinion and perspectives.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 18:17:40	@cualquieratrece @shauskins @kharyp I became an NRA RSO 4 that purpose &amp; 2 volunteer on my sons rifle team when he was younger. Safety first
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 18:19:46	@cualquieratrece @kharyp will never see that in NY anyway, lol
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 18:25:20	@KittyOn28 I hear u but I would rather be surrounded by lawful and peaceful gun owners than criminals. NY has become more violent in crime
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 18:30:08	@KittyOn28 I agree with you. Don't feel safe as long as our governor passes gun laws that don't make us any safer
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 18:38:37	@KittyOn28 you cannot explain the violent acts that people do but it doesn't make it a gun issue. People kill with cars, bats, machetes
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-19 12:49:35	@2ANow Everyone quick with blaming guns but if a dad buys his son a gun. Nothing 2 do with gun control. Obama lied as well. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 20:39:57	@KittyOn28 not everyone. Who told you that? Takes 6 months here with a clean record &amp; free of mental. Only criminals get them illegally
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 20:41:29	@KittyOn28 I agree that it is a big responsibility owning a firearm. I recommend anyone to educate themselves with a safety class
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 22:05:32	@greta @realDonaldTrump #greta  we need a candidate with true American values. We need 2 restore what America once was. He has a great shot!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-18 18:43:11	@Talkmaster @2ANow Totally true. Not a gun issue. He knew there would be no risk or danger 2 him. A coward. Gun free zones kill. #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 21:15:28	@NYSRPA will the gangs &amp; criminals be required 2 lock up their firearms? Oh, sorry, another dumb law 4 law abiding only. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-17 22:46:14	@ProGunOwner @CuomoWatch @Rob__Base They have a lot of nerve passing it knowing we R trying 2 repeat safe act. Useless law won't stop crime!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-18 21:04:30	@Tomfreeusa @nysafeact This is not a gun issue. We will never rid evil. Timothy McVeigh most evil ever &amp; never used a gun. #gunowners #2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-18 21:08:38	@jeffdunham when do you come to NY?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-18 22:45:08	@bob_owens @TheHappyPelican Unfortunately, there was nobody with a CC in the church.Maybe would have saved a few lives. Gun free zones kill
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-19 00:11:21	@Rockprincess818 @TheHappyPelican Gun control will never prevent evil from walking the earth.That church should have allowed CC. #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-19 00:31:05	@Rockprincess818 @TheHappyPelican We shouldn't be asking what's going through a deranged persons head except a bullet from a law abiding CC!

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-19 00:55:40	@helensmomma @FCN2go what's taking so long. Billions of dollars toward research and nothing. My dad tried experimental drugs but didn't help
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-18 11:10:59	@KittyOn28 You originally said anyone can get a gun, now you say safe act is effective? You contradict yourself. It only works for good guys
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-18 11:13:15	@KittyOn28 criminals don't wait online @police headquarters for a pistol licenses or register. Safe act targets lawful  person only.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-19 01:13:16	@how_about_eggs @Rockprincess818 @TheHappyPelican We should all be mourning the victims but our president made it a gun issue today. Sad
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-18 13:44:57	@albuquerquekid4 @kharyp not sure what u r saying. Not have what?
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-19 01:45:59	@megynkelly @DLoesch @NomikiKonst His dad gave him a legal gun as a gift. What law would prevent that? Cannot stop evil! #gunowners #2A

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-20 12:29:59	@CuomoWatch @observer Those 2 million tenants probably voted for Cuomo and support the Unsafe act. let them sweat 4 awhile. #gunowners ##2A
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-20 12:34:39	@CuomoWatch @observer Everyone is worrying about NYC. Nassau County never had any rent guidelines &amp; renters R struggling. Nobody cares here!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-20 12:44:16	@BigFatDave @nysafeact Very accurate. Why R citizens in a gun free zone less important than a politician with bodyguards? #gunowners #2A

2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-20 13:23:35	@News12LI Although, not a gun issue, these stories make me sick &amp; clearly shows why we need to defend from predators like this. #gunowners
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-20 18:20:26	@Kyluckyman @guntruth @GRAAmerica Except Fox News, lol. All he can do is try 2 criticize them but nobody listens. Can't argue talking points
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-20 18:36:11	@ShepNewsTeam So unfortunate &amp; so young to be so misled into hatred. Hard 2 believe parents didn't know. His friends knew but kept quiet.
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-20 18:43:09	@guntruth @GRAAmerica Very sad &amp; unfortunate. Hard 2 believe they don't even want off duty/retired law enforcement. Didn't see exceptions!
2317865342	firefighters510	2015-06-20 18:49:09	@BearingArmsCom Why so hard for @Everytown &amp; @NYAGV1 2 comprehend this fact. The killer had time 2 reload so a CC could've saved the day #2A
