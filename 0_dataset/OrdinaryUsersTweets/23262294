23262294	Jason830	2011-10-09 02:33:02	And quaterback... dint forget quaterback RT @Jared_Sully0: We lost our energy, passion, and poise......
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-09 02:34:15	Maybe Braxton Miller makes a Tony Romo/Jesus like return and leads the bucks to victory
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-09 02:38:51	@Pthompson913 declared the Jackets good after 5 games last year. I declared them bad after 2. Failure is easier to spot than greatness
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-09 02:58:22	The rain only encourages the crowd, thus, helps Nebraska. Again, defensive touchdown or loss
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-09 03:02:54	Why should we not feel great anyways? This game shouldn't even be close
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-09 03:08:03	Buckeyes = done
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-03 15:40:49	ESPN treats Tony Romo like a prom queen when he's really class treasurer runner up at best

23262294	Jason830	2011-10-11 11:30:58	It probably won't happen, it would just suck for the NHL to sit around and do nothing while the NBA is putting a season in the tank

23262294	Jason830	2011-10-16 03:07:07	Fact; 100@% of Ohio states pass completions today were touchdowns
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-13 02:17:20	Can't blame that loss on Mason. He did give up an untimely goal, but also stoped 15 shots in the 3rd while the offense only generated 1
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-13 11:54:14	Joel Matlin, president of alarmforce = drunk

23262294	Jason830	2011-10-09 03:01:33	The best u can hope for now is a shit load defensive stops and then overtime. Bauserman will not get this team any points #Drinking
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-09 03:09:05	Not enough octoberfest beer in the state to make me feel better about this now
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-09 03:12:04	Truly a shame Miller got hurt. U could see him growing as a QB as the game progressed
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-09 03:16:14	Defensive touchdown or embarrassment
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-09 03:29:13	Bauserman had the hand-off of the century they way he gave Nebraska that game
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-09 03:54:39	The defense did give up 28 points, but at least Miller helped keep the defense off the field for a little bit
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-09 04:03:55	Bottom line: Ohio state was a knee injury away from at least staying in the game. Everyone has injuries, great teams overcome them
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-14 19:44:37	@Pthompson913 I almost got some. Thought it would be just like Budweiser. Got dead Guy instead. (Confident dead Guy is better)

23262294	Jason830	2011-10-22 14:55:57	Why didn't captain America just go with something like "captain awesome" and not commit himself to a life time of patriotism
23262294	Jason830	2011-10-22 19:24:20	@TheNewChrisM that's crazy. I bet he wasn't trying to bum a cup of sugar
23262294	Jason830	2011-11-04 23:58:02	I'm kinda supprised this place didn't just hand out razors at the front door

23262294	Jason830	2011-11-06 20:42:00	Why have no moves been made? U have 4 days till ur next game. If something is gonna happen, why wait?
23262294	Jason830	2011-11-10 23:54:13	@fun_in_bathroom I'll quote a wise man, who once said "bitches be trippin'"
23262294	Jason830	2011-11-11 00:21:53	I said I was done with jackets, yet I'm watching the game #WhatsWrongWithMe
23262294	Jason830	2011-11-11 00:27:17	Once again, Derek Dorset may be the only player on the Jackets who plays with any passion or enthusiasm. And he mostly show it by fighting
23262294	Jason830	2011-11-11 00:31:38	Rick Nash looks ridiculous #RapistMustache
23262294	Jason830	2011-11-11 00:43:00	I hate that I like what Mark May said of PSU - "think about what we didn't know 5 days ago, then imagine what we'll know 5 months from now"
23262294	Jason830	2011-11-11 01:13:57	Blackhawks have 3 goals. This game is already over
23262294	Jason830	2011-11-11 01:46:38	The jackets have given up 14 goals in the last 5 periods of play while scoring 3. If Arneil is behind the bench in the 3rd... whatever #SHIT
23262294	Jason830	2011-11-11 12:18:09	Nothing to fear now, Jackets fans... Nikita Nikitin is here... seriously? This is ur answer? This deal is gonna win games?

23262294	Jason830	2011-11-16 02:41:07	I'm sure the game didn't stop cause of how many wins he has. How many channels do u need to show this on?

23262294	Jason830	2011-12-04 04:20:41	If I understand, the reason they keep score in football is to see which team is better. LSU already showed they're better than Alabama
23262294	Jason830	2011-12-04 04:21:53	Well... at least they showed they're feild goal kicker is better
23262294	Jason830	2011-12-04 04:25:26	@Pthompson913 I shoulda been watching football the last 3 hours but I was watching breaking bad instead. I blame u for that

23262294	Jason830	2011-11-20 03:46:29	They gave up 3 goals, but I think the Jackets looked good tonight. Plays that woulda fail early this year didn't fail as hard

23262294	Jason830	2011-12-05 02:58:09	Once again, if ur gonna put Alabama in the title game against lsu, why even play the game? They decided who was better a month ago
23262294	Jason830	2011-12-05 14:01:17	I keep hearing how unfair this whole bcs thing is to LSU, and how they shouldn't have had to play the extra game... tell that to Oak St
23262294	Jason830	2011-12-05 14:03:30	Lets say Baja wins by 3 in OT. Each team essentially  won they same way in the others house. Who is ur champ?
23262294	Jason830	2011-12-05 14:05:19	IF LSU lost in the sec championship game, they still would be going to the national championship game. What if they DID lose..? To Bama?
23262294	Jason830	2011-12-05 14:06:22	When is enough enough? Its not a best of three.
23262294	Jason830	2011-12-05 14:08:57	And hearing ESPN trying to justify it is gross. Does any one outside of Alabama want to see this matchup?

23262294	Jason830	2012-04-08 12:46:02	My son just said "so I guess the Easter bunny is Chinese cause all this stuff is made in China"
23262294	Jason830	2012-04-10 23:16:19	Things funnier than a crosseyed baby... not many
23262294	Jason830	2012-04-18 11:01:55	If the NHL is consistent, Raffi Torres gets at 4+ games. Shaw got 3 for accidental head contact... Torres sent a star out on a stretcher
23262294	Jason830	2012-04-11 12:03:00	I think I still have teeth stuck in the steak I had for dinner last night
23262294	Jason830	2012-04-13 12:34:58	Can't think of many problems a clean pair of shell toes can't fix. Today's choice... http://t.co/wTS1zMin
23262294	Jason830	2012-04-13 12:39:30	Not suspending Shea Webber was bad. But a $2500 fine is a total insult to the hockey world. What he did was more WWE than NHL
23262294	Jason830	2012-04-13 12:42:59	Also I've been watching more wrestling lately and I still can't get use to wwE... doesn't sound right

23262294	Jason830	2012-04-21 20:26:26	If Raffi Torres hits Joe Nobody the way he did Hossa does he still get 25 games? I'd guess not.

23262294	Jason830	2012-04-23 20:30:45	Ron Artest should be kicked out of the NBA. That may seem harsh, but it better to end his career than wait for him to end someone else's

23262294	Jason830	2012-04-26 01:12:58	A little perspective on the Raffi Torres suspension... Todd Bertuzzi got 20 games when he broke Steve Moore's neck and enede his career
23262294	Jason830	2012-04-26 01:15:11	... if Moore had the skills Hosea has, would that have been different? Bertuzzi missed playoff games, but game importance shouldn't matter

23262294	Jason830	2013-11-10 01:05:25	#CBJ look soft. They're admittedly lazy and aren't making their opponents pay the price for beating them to the puck.. or any battle, really
23262294	Jason830	2013-11-10 02:24:36	My kid just made peanut butter cookies that'll knock your socks off!
23262294	Jason830	2013-11-17 14:20:55	One of the cars at work got wrecked so we rented a Fiat 500. I periodically get the urge to throw turtle shells at people whilst driving it.
23262294	Jason830	2013-11-17 14:27:06	@PThompson913 perhaps the coolest shoe ever. I follow them on IG, they posted a pic a few days ago.
23262294	Jason830	2013-11-17 14:27:56	@PThompson913 ... in a related story, do you need any gift ideas for me for christmas?
23262294	Jason830	2013-11-17 16:12:36	@PThompson913 it's the approximate size of a mario kart. It has a "sport mode" that'll do 0-60 in like 9 seconds...

23262294	Jason830	2013-12-01 00:59:26	@DoctorKeck I sorta agree. I did take 4 missed field goals and a crazy return tho...
23262294	Jason830	2013-12-08 01:48:48	@DoctorKeck ... "mayhem" can be a dick, too...

23262294	Jason830	2013-12-08 05:16:33	Nothing productive ohio state did on offense worked for more than 4 plays.
23262294	Jason830	2013-12-08 05:18:41	MSU was better... more prepared... made better adjustments... well played green... but thanks for setting the B10 back another 4 years!
23262294	Jason830	2013-12-08 05:21:31	Thats pretty much the exact opposite of what I expected

23262294	Jason830	2014-03-26 02:11:43	That was big boy hockey. #CBJ #SuckItBertuzzi

23262294	Jason830	2014-03-30 23:56:27	@PThompson913 yeah. And fixing the pickup switch.
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-01 12:29:32	It must suck for the person that really does find out they're pregnant today
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-02 02:52:17	Blues vs flyers... Great hockey
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-02 01:37:32	Defense owes Bob a nice dinner. They sure didn't do him any favors tonight. #CBJ

23262294	Jason830	2014-04-08 03:25:21	Don't be sad, Kentucky. Even if you won, it'd be vacated in 3 years anyways
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-08 03:34:28	Damn! Forgot to click "submit" #CouldaWonABillion

23262294	Jason830	2014-04-09 05:33:30	Why check for murderers behind the shower curtain? If someone wanted to kill me at 1:30 A.M. they would probably do it while I was sleeping
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-09 01:45:52	Now they can clinch a playoff spot without scoring another goal
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-10 03:01:38	Playoffs!!! #CBJ

23262294	Jason830	2014-04-20 00:00:22	Now I'm sad and want cake
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-20 01:43:55	@AlwaysMom213 got cake. Not dead yet... May be soon if this game goes on much longer
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-20 02:13:59	... Shit...
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-20 02:35:06	You don't have to give a shit about either team... What Pitt and the #CBJ are doing is awesome. Great game. Fantastic hockey
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-20 02:37:07	If the #CBJ lose, the series is over. No coming back from that
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-20 02:44:49	The boy and I have been at B-Dubd in WV for over 4 hours watching hockey #CBJ #DontLetItBeForNothing
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-20 02:52:22	I never thought I'd see the day... #CBJ
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-22 02:16:29	After standing in line for 9 hours to sit in the last row of the arena, I really wish that ended better. Good playoff hockey tho #CBJ
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-21 12:18:32	I'm in line for tickets at nationwide and I'll be here ALL FUCKING DAY! So if any one want to hang out or bring me food... Feel free
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-21 12:20:22	And the chair I bought yesterday for this occasion is the sorriest excuse for a chair I've ever sat in
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-21 12:21:20	And news crews are here so you might see my big dumb ass on TV this morning... OR this afternoon... I'll still be here
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-21 12:48:56	I wonder if the jimmy johns across the street will bring me a sandwich
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-24 00:23:06	Foligno looks like he wants to be a figure skater with all the spins n junk he's doing
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-26 23:40:08	Should I be happy or nervous? #CBJ #Boone
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-27 01:25:38	Pittsburgh is just better tonight
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-24 01:44:05	Unbelievable! #CBJ
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-24 01:51:29	.... Gotta remember to breath....
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-24 01:52:26	@PThompson913 agree. This is remarkable, even if your team isn't involved
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-24 02:02:50	Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes #CBJ
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-24 02:25:36	Jack skille doesn't show up on the stat sheet, but dude has played his ass off this series. #CBJ
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-28 19:47:49	Today has been like my own personal version of hell... Feeling like I have to sneeze all day.
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-28 23:12:56	I don't feel good about this one...
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-28 23:23:26	Looks like this may play out like game 1. Jackets will have no legs by the 3rd period
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 00:07:15	The flood gate may be open for Pittsburghs top scorers now too
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 00:07:50	Wiz = bad
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 00:09:18	You don't REALLY think they're coming back from 3-0 AGAIN, do you?
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 00:19:36	Im not mad Pitt is dominating. I'm bummed because CBJ showed they CAN play with them for 4 out of these 6 games#NoMoreEnergy?
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 00:38:29	They can't even get a good look on the PP...
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 00:50:17	I want to say "I can't believe this is happening" but really I can't belive this didn't happen sooner #CBJ
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 01:03:30	Step 2...? Step 3- prophet  @BlueJacketsNHL: Step one: kill the penalty. Step one has been completed.
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 01:07:44	@LoriSchmidt shout "Score!"?
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 01:08:27	Just dont let 87 score, please...
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 01:14:32	I guess this is better than an overtime loss
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 01:15:49	Ref's called roughing cause wiz barked like a dog
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 01:28:10	Pitt timeout is coach telling players "Yens calm dawn!"
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 01:30:56	Im confused
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 01:33:06	If the #CBJ aren't going to win, I think I wish it wasn't this close
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 01:37:18	Draw up a play ritchie, it works every time
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 01:39:36	Breath.....
23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 01:41:14	Ouch

23262294	Jason830	2014-04-29 03:29:28	In the first 2 periods, I changed my clothes twice, stood, and sat on 4 different seats on 3 different sofas in 2 rooms #Superstition? #CBJ

23262294	Jason830	2014-05-13 01:53:30	I have this bad habit of drinking, then wanting to play with power tools. It's like, I want a bar in my basement, but only after a few beers
