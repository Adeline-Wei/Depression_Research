233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-08 18:56:56	The NFL should've released him from the jump, not weeks after a decision now that we all have seen the video.
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-08 18:58:15	They suspend someone for half the damn season for smoking weed, but condone domestic violence..Am I the only one who sees a problem in that?

233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 01:40:09	That should've been an unnecessary roughness call..
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 01:42:24	BULLSHIT
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 01:43:14	@HonnnneyBee he got up from being down and then yall got mad and took a cheap shot..
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 01:45:33	AND ANOTHER TOUCHDOWNNNN!! 👌😁👏👏 #CowboysNation
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 01:48:56	I have people on my TL rooting for my Cowboys that were hating on them last year. Even if it's my team, don't be a bandwagon. 😴
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 01:55:22	There's still a whole half left, it could be anyone's game.
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:00:51	As long as we don't get cocky or sloppy in the second half, we got this. ✊🏉 #CowboysNation
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:03:54	All the commentators do is ride Graham's dick
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:06:33	I've always wanted to try Moe's Southwest Grill
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:07:17	DEFENSE! Cmon boys!
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:07:57	@HonnnneyBee is it like chipotle?
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:09:51	@HonnnneyBee oohh! We'll go 👌
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:18:51	MURRAY IS A BEAST!!
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:19:10	Saints are 🚮
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:22:20	Trying to do homework while watching football is quite the task.
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:23:01	Sometimes, I tweet things, and they just disappear. 😂
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:34:23	I haven't seen my Cowboys play like this in awhile, they need to keep it up.
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:36:37	People always have some kind of shit to talk about the Cowboys, no one can ever come out and say that they actually had a decent game.
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:37:57	It's so hard being a Dallas fan, but I was raised one, and I'm going to die one. #CowboysNation #HowBoutThemCowboys ✊🏈💙
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:39:20	I just want to know why so many people hate them. You can't call us the most bandwagoned team in the NFL cause it's not 1993 sooo..
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:39:38	Don't worry, I'll wait 😴😴
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:41:05	Of course we get an unnecessary hit call but they didn't.
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:44:07	Robinson came out running like a bat out of hell 😳
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:49:26	@HonnnneyBee I'm glad I could assist ✊
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 02:57:09	Again, where's the defense?!
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 03:01:09	@KeenanRyanC we haven't been on or A game since the 90s, yet we get talked the most shit about. Why would people bandwagon a sucky team?
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 03:03:54	CMON BOYS!
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 03:04:56	I'm about to start swinging my fists 😅😅
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 03:05:56	Graham is so big 😳
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 03:06:31	“@roblockk: When bae has a headache http://t.co/vvMJyc9Xbn” jordan does this to me 😁
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 03:08:48	Every time we rush Brees, he gets away. 😐
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 03:15:51	@HonnnneyBee thank you! It only took us 4 years to beat yall 😂😂

233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 13:56:35	Everyone is being abnormally loud today, and it's literally driving me crazy. 😩🙉😑
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 13:59:21	And the girl beside me won't stop smacking her gum 😩😭
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 15:44:56	Just found a Pit Bull that is going to euthanized within the next two days if he'a not adopted because they "have no room" 😒😭😭😭
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-29 15:46:20	If it was any other dog, they wouldn't put it down, but because it's a pit bull, they're pushing for it.
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-30 19:55:52	When you order something and it ships the same day &gt;&gt;&gt; 👏👏
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-30 02:49:02	If you don't like tattoos, fine, that's your prerogative, but don't talk down about someone else just because they have them. Grow up.
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-30 20:36:05	I am so sick and tired of women being idolized by their curves.
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-30 20:37:16	Just because someone has a phat ass, slim waist, thick hips, and perky boobs, doesn't make them any more beautiful than someone else.
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-30 20:38:20	You guys that feed off of what a "woman should look like" need to come down off your high horse and stop treating us objects to look at
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-30 20:39:23	What if we start calling yall boyfriend material based off  abs and penis size? Bet you wouldn't like that😴
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-30 20:40:18	Everyone is beautiful in their own way, whether they have curves or not.
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-09-30 20:40:41	I'm sleep tho
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-10-01 05:08:24	Can't sleep for shit 😒😪
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-10-01 05:14:54	My biggest weakness is not letting people get too close to me and then completely shutting down and pushing them away when they try.
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2014-10-01 13:06:13	Secret love, my escape
Take me far, far away

233079143	_thatgurlBree	2015-04-11 06:35:26	@HonnnneyBee YES! But mostly because it was all about Serena. Likeeee, I can't stand her and it literally revolved around her 😐😐😐😐

233079143	_thatgurlBree	2015-04-28 16:26:51	What's going on all over the U.S. isn't right or fair whatsoever, but answering violence with violence is never the answer.
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2015-04-28 16:27:59	What's going on in Baltimore is NOT okay despite the situation. They are just giving people more evidence to the labels put  against them.

233079143	_thatgurlBree	2015-04-30 04:09:49	I don't understand how girls can dog a guy one week and then be all over his 🍆 the next. I thought he was a piece of 💩?
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2015-04-30 04:11:45	KNOW YOUR WORTH. Once you learn it, you'll never settle for less than you deserve, I promise you that. You don't always need a man.

233079143	_thatgurlBree	2015-05-06 03:37:08	If you incessantly talk about how your man doesn't treat you right yet do nothing to make your situation better, then you're as dumb as him.
233079143	_thatgurlBree	2015-05-06 03:37:35	Don't talk about it, be about it. Nobody can change your situation but you.
