233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-02 18:04:02	@toontoonbarmy ahh let him go if he really wants,we can change philosophy maybe and become stronger. 1 man doesnt make a team!! Toon toon
233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-02 23:12:29	@RoryHanley asking much?? Both north east teams are dire
233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-02 23:16:04	@RoryHanley I'm beyond crying I realised a good few months ago we would struggle!!
233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-02 23:18:49	@RoryHanley you do that for both of us surely!!
233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-12 21:04:30	@milesSI football manager it is then!!

233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-24 20:23:48	@toontoonbarmy I know everyone knew but they were too stubborn to do anything, is this sissokko good? Still gonna be an uphill battle
233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-24 20:26:45	@toontoonbarmy no your right sure we needed 1 extra even when ba was here, goufrann only compensates for ba a proven striker woukd be nice
233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-24 20:27:09	@toontoonbarmy or another run from cisse like he did last season

233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-29 22:01:19	@toontoonbarmy not work on corners in training cause they are terrible and show no signs of improving and also losing the ball from a throw
233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-27 18:28:26	@Patrice_Fearon your quick to follow the Oldham players!!
233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-27 19:26:23	@Patrice_Fearon you'll be in hello yet then!! I'll buy that copy lol
233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-29 20:41:00	@toontoonbarmy so far so good, I know its against a poor team but I'm delighted so far, more pressing and passing tho still shit at corners!
233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-29 21:07:32	@toontoonbarmy fucking lucky to be drawing now!! Same old newcastle
233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-29 21:59:26	@toontoonbarmy like when we are all back defending why can we not get it down and force a counter attack, instead of just hoofing it as we
233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-29 22:00:24	@toontoonbarmy end up losing the ball anyway and then invite more pressure,pardew has to be doing more to keep performances up and do they
233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-29 22:02:13	@toontoonbarmy in what's that all about? Still 3 points and keeps us in the pack of positions just above us but 2 hard games coming up
233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-30 07:40:01	@TimKrul only for you Tim best keeper in the league
233313069	CathalOHare	2013-01-29 15:08:44	@toontoonbarmy it is surely I'm still very unsure but I'm always negative!! I hope to god we win but jury's out until I see performances!!

233313069	CathalOHare	2013-11-26 21:12:34	@TheRealPhilipK they go through a qualification process so explain to me why they don't deserve it? Aberdeen and Celtic in the past have....

233313069	CathalOHare	2014-12-21 17:55:35	@RoryHanley fuck sake is all i can say
233313069	CathalOHare	2014-12-26 18:12:11	@RoryHanley i cant talk but what did i say...
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-01-15 21:49:17	@IgyZove69 only cause it was against real?
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-01-15 21:52:36	@IgyZove69 its all to do with the hair,has he got the highlights back?
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-01-17 20:47:52	@RoryHanley could you make a good team out of both newcastle and scumberland?
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-01-17 20:50:45	@RoryHanley probably not! Relegation battle now...
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-01-17 20:53:14	@RoryHanley itll be tight we need 5 wins  so wont be easy.need a good manager in now as the next 3 games are winnable but just not good enuf
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-01-17 20:55:59	@RoryHanley need a good manager full stop someone to freshen the whole setup
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-02-22 17:48:30	@IgyZove69 @michkeegan igy calm down
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-03-25 20:37:31	Watching @JohnBishop100 Australia good watch and even better choice of music with @The_National
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-16 13:59:30	@RoryHanley haha here we could both be plying our trade in the championship together if we keep going the way we are!!! 2 brutal teams...
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-16 14:13:22	@RoryHanley as bad as we are 1 more win should see us over the line but things need to change.If we were championship wed be struggling
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-16 14:29:40	@RoryHanley we are planning a boycott but it wont be as big as yours After 50 mins last week 😂😂 people going on about pardew doing well at
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-16 14:30:33	@RoryHanley palace hes still a average manager though in saying that we are a average team... Be glad to see the back of the season
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-16 14:33:44	@RoryHanley fair enough your a true supporter but if i lived in the north east I wouldn't be wasting money to watch what we produce every wk
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-16 14:36:25	@RoryHanley realistically top 7 is out of reach but newcastle need to be pushing those teams but are a million miles away..cant even compete
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-16 14:37:10	@RoryHanley with the smaller teams in terms of buying players and any that do come only use it as a stepping stone
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-18 13:45:51	@emilyeavis why aren't @The_National on the lineup? Be my 4th time this year and they have never been announced... Long time since 2010!
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-26 21:23:44	@barrabest seen it!!
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-28 21:36:31	@RoryHanley bad result for both of us tonight!! Fuck it whatever happens we still have to go to shitty work
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-28 21:38:43	@RoryHanley well we need a win from somewhere and leicester will beat us on Saturday the way things are going...Fed up of it all to b honest
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-28 21:40:03	@RoryHanley you could happily relegate 10/11 teams in the premiership! I looked at your fuxtures and 6 points was the max points total...
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-28 21:40:49	@RoryHanley fuckin help ourselves id take a draw all day... Thats where we are at!
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-28 21:41:56	@RoryHanley who knows its crazy results season... Be great to go back to the early noughties...
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-28 21:44:45	@RoryHanley massive summer ahead regardless if they appoint carver or mcclaren im done... Wont be back for a long time not wasting money

233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-28 21:47:24	@RoryHanley you have the life of it... What you gaining by learning the language?
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-28 21:48:42	@RoryHanley fair enough you're not giving much away
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-28 21:50:48	@RoryHanley still in a supermarket on a road to nowhere but no motivation to change...
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-28 21:51:51	@RoryHanley hard to do but yeah maybe when im 30 getting old
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-04-30 15:56:18	@NUFC @premierleague should be winning games like west brom and west ham at home which would be atleast 6 points!!! The ambition is oozing..
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-05-18 18:43:16	@RoryHanley which one will be drowning the sorrows sunday?
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-05-18 18:48:09	@RoryHanley as in Sunderland? We deserve relegation no hope going forward anywayv
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-06-09 17:22:33	@The_National should be at @GlastoFest !!
233313069	CathalOHare	2015-06-16 21:14:50	@nicoladygaga @taylorswift13 @emilyeavis @GlastoFest wise up! The @The_National could easily play ya a 2 1/2 hour set!!
