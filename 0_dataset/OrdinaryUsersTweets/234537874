234537874	greynolds2009	2011-01-12 22:43:18	@khalid_al_talib #mesa201 the article mentioned sectarian violence. Is this Sunni/Shiite violence, or Muslim/Christian violence?
234537874	greynolds2009	2011-01-13 18:07:02	@chacoman87 #mesa201 I would imagine Israel is getting very nervous right now, seeing as they have had trouble with Hezbollah before.
234537874	greynolds2009	2011-01-11 00:41:16	I'm in Mesa cuz I love Arab people. I grew up in Israel and Jordan and have grown much respect for Arabs. I hope to learn history. #mesa201
234537874	greynolds2009	2011-01-20 20:52:55	@ahenrie3 #mesa201 what other resources do they have. Jordan has tried to become a technological center but hasn't been very successful.
234537874	greynolds2009	2011-01-20 21:00:20	#mesa201 http://fxn.ws/dYOaDq Turkey urges Iran to offer nuclear assurance. How much influence do other middle eastern nations have on Iran?
234537874	greynolds2009	2011-01-20 21:06:08	#mesa201 where in the middle east have people traveled? I lived in Israel and Jordan. I've made it to Syria, Egypt, Tunisia, Iraq and Qatar.
234537874	greynolds2009	2011-01-20 21:07:50	@rebaverill @doxdan I don't think Iran would use them acting by themselves. It would have to be a big event involving the whole Mid East.
234537874	greynolds2009	2011-01-20 21:11:23	@doxdan I think it's gonna take the second coming to sort it out.
234537874	greynolds2009	2011-01-20 21:12:54	@diggintheworld #mesa201 Israel really needs to stop expanding if they want the talks to work. But then maybe they don't want them too.
234537874	greynolds2009	2011-01-29 23:13:12	@maohiag #mesa201 yes but those are problems in all Arab countries. Comparatively Jordan is doing very well. Reform in Egypt was needed more
234537874	greynolds2009	2011-01-29 23:14:36	@Trust_Always_33 #mesa201 but that was in Qatar, a very westernized gulf nation.

234537874	greynolds2009	2011-01-29 23:22:11	@alexs729 #mesa201 I don't think the Egyptians are screaming for democracy. prob just for a new Mubarak who will give them what they want.

234537874	greynolds2009	2011-02-12 21:31:09	@ahenrie3 #mesa201 I don't have a source or anything, but I've heard that the church was officially recognized in Jordan.
234537874	greynolds2009	2011-02-12 21:38:42	@dreadin2 @maohiag I honestly don't see it happening in Jordan. The people there really do like the king.
234537874	greynolds2009	2011-02-12 21:44:13	@chacoman87 I wonder what the church will do with more freedom? I don't think they'll be able to send in missionaries right away.

234537874	greynolds2009	2011-02-16 01:17:09	@davidwall_mesa #mesa201 the cars could get horrible gas mileage, and no one would care.
234537874	greynolds2009	2011-02-16 01:18:13	@mikee_g16 #mesa201 so much for Iran's hi hopes.
234537874	greynolds2009	2011-02-16 01:22:57	@ahenrie3 #mesa201 don't count on it. If there is one thing we Americans love to do, it's protest something.
