2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-21 15:11:52	@JSTradeDesk NZD/USD could we move the stop to there if it does not go through soon.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-21 15:16:56	@JSTradeDesk ok, I will follow suit and leave for now.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-21 15:17:20	@JSTradeDesk are you seeing any intraday trades today.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-21 17:19:38	@JSTradeDesk very good, only been trading a month and I see I have made the same mistakes already. message to self, calm down....
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-24 16:31:17	@JSTradeDesk do you see these as resistance?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-24 16:32:58	@JSTradeDesk possible shorts if they fail to break through?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-24 16:36:44	@JSTradeDesk is that after the close?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-27 13:21:01	@JSTradeDesk HEAR YOU
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-27 15:04:09	@JSTradeDesk I missed the start of what you were saying, will this be an order?.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-27 15:07:16	@JSTradeDesk Ok, thanks.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-27 15:25:53	@JSTradeDesk I only started trading in Jan and had a good month. Feb has been horrible, has Feb been good or bad in your view.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-27 16:01:13	@JSTradeDesk NZD/USD 8374- I think you mentioned that possibility before, short out of the question now?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-27 16:04:16	@JSTradeDesk Missed that on USD/MXN buffering, anything important?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-27 18:27:06	@JSTradeDesk USD/ZAR still alive thankfully, Looking good or not?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-28 15:43:06	@JSTradeDesk did you get . 1067?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-28 15:45:12	@JSTradeDesk did you get 1.1067?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-28 15:50:10	@JSTradeDesk is 1.1120 target an important level.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-28 15:56:39	@JSTradeDesk ok, this trade is to be closed before close tonight (10pm gmt) correct?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-28 16:02:29	@JSTradeDesk is there any reason to not place the stop right behind the level and hope for a continue when trade resumes on Sunday evening.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-28 16:11:02	@JSTradeDesk Not to worry, we are in now, hopefully light and the end of a dull week..
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-28 16:13:06	@JSTradeDesk Think I will use the stop, hope for the best, March is going to be a better month. (hopefully, I say with everything crossed)
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-28 17:14:32	@JSTradeDesk did you see something bad Jamie.. ???
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-28 17:20:14	@JSTradeDesk Okay, sound's like you have had enough of Feb, I know I have.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-28 17:36:18	@JSTradeDesk I am off training now, work has finished this side of the pond, have a good weeked ( forget feb)...
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-28 17:37:29	@JSTradeDesk (forgot to add)  Is it okay to pop you an email over the weekend, regarding other services on offer from fxdaily.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-26 16:33:28	@JSTradeDesk are 2.23,2.24 or 2.28  all resistance where it could possibly turn or just 2.28
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-26 16:39:37	@JSTradeDesk Okay, so we look and hope for a turn anywhere in between.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-27 21:45:16	@JSTradeDesk NZD/USD - has turned downward over the last 4 hours, do you think that could be  top.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-26 18:25:33	@JSTradeDesk @daltonsrevere what would you see as potential stop and target.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-26 21:37:26	@JSTradeDesk Been away from laptop, are we still 5 orders and no open.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-26 21:42:41	@JSTradeDesk has AUD/NZD opened ?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-26 22:01:52	@JSTradeDesk Thanks.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-28 14:46:51	@JSTradeDesk cad/jpy, is 92 an area where it go either way?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-02-28 14:48:09	@JSTradeDesk I have to leave my screen for a while, do you see any harm in me leaving an order for cad/usd?.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-03 13:54:23	@JSTradeDesk seem's to be bobbing around 101.20-30 all day, I take it this is a support level?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-03 14:00:11	@JSTradeDesk what would you like to see for a trade, a continued hold of this level? or a drop lower?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-03 14:03:26	@JSTradeDesk ok.thanks.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-03 14:09:35	@JSTradeDesk so, if we touch 101 then pull back and hold for at least an hour possible trade, touch 101.50 then back to 101.20's, poss long?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-03 14:14:50	@JSTradeDesk Okay, fingers crossed. enjoyed the weekend letter, put a few things into perspective for a newbie.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-03 15:33:52	@JSTradeDesk USD/CAD on the decline, are you looking at similar levels to last week.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-04 19:06:51	@JSTradeDesk Very good, food for thought...
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-04 13:18:42	@JSTradeDesk Good morning Jamie, what is TLT ?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-05 16:57:12	@JSTradeDesk @daltonsrevere Did the same, set stop at just above our buy order level though, tried earlier at lower level and got stopped
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-05 16:58:15	@JSTradeDesk @daltonsrevere ignore last comment, adding to the wrong thread
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-05 16:58:53	@JSTradeDesk @DavidAHarrold  Did the same, set stop at just above our buy order level though, tried earlier at lower level and got stopped
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-05 17:25:04	@JSTradeDesk I agree, have to swim mid-day every day and gym train after work, feel like I am slipping into a coma otherwise sat at a desk.

2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-05 09:47:17	@daytradesignals Hi Jason, I have just subscribed to your daily gold report, can I post questions here.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-05 10:10:56	@daytradesignals Just looking at gold as of now, do you think 1332-34 will be support again today, long with stop under 1331?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-05 10:17:31	@daytradesignals sorry I am new to all this, OVERSOLD SHORT TERM??? still getting up to speed with all the terms.

2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-06 13:47:20	@JSTradeDesk 1.10 is lurking USD/CAD, still of interest ?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-06 13:54:58	@JSTradeDesk okay, does the all important Friday low come into the equation.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-06 14:05:58	@JSTradeDesk Learning and rembering, seems to be a lot of action today, to me any how.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-06 14:40:15	@JSTradeDesk do you see EUR/USD going higher, has past feb high, could it pass dec high?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-05 20:46:42	@JSTradeDesk Hi Jamie good workout? looking at usd/cad is this area support 1.1030-40?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-05 21:19:24	@JSTradeDesk as in last Friday's low or do you mean wait for a low this Friday, I belive last Friday's low was 1.1039.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-05 21:23:46	@JSTradeDesk ok, got you.. I take it this is the general idea with any pairing.If I may ask what is so important with a Friday low.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-05 21:51:34	@JSTradeDesk understand now, I had read the letter just did not click, a lot to remember.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-05 21:58:01	@JSTradeDesk A tough one at times, not for the weak hearted. I never thought you could experience such adrenalin sat still at a desk.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-07 13:46:21	@DayTradeIdeas do you see 1333/32 holding, take profit opportunity?

2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-12 09:28:52	@DayTradeIdeas Ahh okay.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-12 14:18:11	@easy2winit FTSE AND DAX sell levels still count from this morning now they have bounced where you stated.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-12 14:38:44	@JSTradeDesk Have you a target in mind?

2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-12 15:37:17	@DayTradeIdeas 1362/63 support for gold now?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-12 15:43:26	@DayTradeIdeas so long stops around 1358/9 shorts if 62/63 gives way then 62/63 becoming resistance
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-12 15:47:00	@DayTradeIdeas Okay, will hang fire and monitor. miss is better than a loss..
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-12 15:48:05	@DayTradeIdeas Maybe a better outlook tomorrow.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-12 15:56:35	@DayTradeIdeas I agree, the filthy rich could just buy or sell anywhere and just wait for profit. not worry about loss or levels.

2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-20 12:05:10	@easy2winit LOL very good, I wish I could trade both ways without loss. Will see what data brings..
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-20 17:02:13	@DayTradeIdeas AUD/USD still see 9050/55 as top for the day.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-20 17:03:21	@JSTradeDesk Hi Jamie, looking at AUD/USD, would you see 9045/55 as strong resistance.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-20 17:05:07	@DayTradeIdeas Thanks. Might sell and hope for 9010/05 again.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-20 17:08:56	@DayTradeIdeas do you mean 9082/87 as top for the day.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-20 17:18:22	@JSTradeDesk Okay thanks, was thinking of a short back to 9010/05 level, will wait and see if I can get higher level.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-20 17:22:36	@JSTradeDesk I see and it is slap bang in the middle, I will for higher level and then sell and possibly but on the lows.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-21 09:16:05	@easy2winit Thanks, +20 on dax, if I did not have to work all day I'd go to the pub..
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-21 09:22:16	@DayTradeIdeas @Jacques5487 What stop would you use?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-21 18:53:49	@easy2winit Hi, Great results enjoying your service, can I ask do you set orders early day with the levels you identify in the e-mail.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-21 14:42:43	@JSTradeDesk @Geoffw123 Looks like a nice climb around 243..
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-21 10:33:52	@easy2winit Do you have a target for FTSE now it has broken 6560?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-21 12:27:28	@JSTradeDesk Hi Jamie, What price did you open GBPS/CAD at ?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-24 13:33:01	@easy2winit is FTSE short still viable?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-24 14:52:42	@easy2winit @ShoaibHameed12 Hopefully bring the long into play, Had a few pips from short, thanks again for more points.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-24 15:58:56	@DayTradeIdeas Is this the one you mentioned around a week ago or so? .. if so I take it that is a good sign.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-24 16:01:41	@DayTradeIdeas Good that you are aware of trades that they are placing now, you can test em out, like us testing your service :)...
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-24 16:05:53	@DayTradeIdeas Sound's good, will be good to catch some move's like that, I am new to this but the last few weeks have seemed mental..
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-25 11:42:38	@easy2winit New to this, what does that mean?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-26 09:34:30	@easy2winit Thanks Yoda... The pip's be with you may..
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-26 08:08:44	@easy2winit +14 on DAX already, :) thanks...
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-26 16:55:59	@easy2winit are PM longs still viable, you mentioned they should be quick, has the op passed.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-27 15:33:04	@easy2winit Not been able to access e-mails for an hour, was it anything important?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-31 13:26:53	@JSTradeDesk Do you think a low for the day Jamie?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-31 13:41:52	@JSTradeDesk Thanks Jamie, I will look out for.8825 for a long.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-31 15:52:17	@JSTradeDesk Do you think it may have gone a little high to hold resistance at 95.29, would this resistance be invalid now?.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-31 16:08:51	@JSTradeDesk Okay, so if it drops below 95.29 then maybe worth a short down to 93.50. will keep and eye out. thanks
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-03-31 16:21:46	@JSTradeDesk  Okay thanks, will keep an eye on it tonight.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-04-01 12:31:37	@JSTradeDesk So we hope to see 96 again today/tomorrow for a short?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-04-04 13:42:20	@JSTradeDesk @Klumputy USD/CHF is still open? I am any how.. as it stopped for you..
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-04-03 13:21:32	@JSTradeDesk Is it worth tightening the stop now 1.3750 is resistance?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-04-03 13:31:22	@JSTradeDesk I agree, I am finding it difficult to think longer term, another step in the learning process,I am going to leave alone for now
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-04-03 13:32:24	@JSTradeDesk Managed to get in at 1.3758, so there is  little breathing space anyhow.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-04-03 13:36:15	@JSTradeDesk Thanks, will monitor and leave, I need a padlock on my trades to keep me from temptation. left the USD/NOK to run still.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-04-01 12:26:04	@JSTradeDesk is 95.29 still an important level for a short down too 94.60/93.50
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-04-03 14:07:07	@JSTradeDesk Did you see something you did not like with EUR/USD?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-04-03 14:11:47	@JSTradeDesk Okay, thanks any way +40 pips for me, and quick gratification ..my favourite..
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-04-03 14:14:55	@JSTradeDesk Any thought's on USD/CAD today?.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-04-02 13:32:21	@JSTradeDesk Hopefully, went long this morning. would you think a stop around 1.0990 would be fine?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-04-02 13:44:05	@JSTradeDesk I have mine slightly lower, I understand I have read some comments on here when we have a loss, Trading is not for every one.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-04-02 13:45:22	@JSTradeDesk If it's any consolation I do  NOT hold you responsible for my losses when trading from your advice.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-04-02 13:45:53	@JSTradeDesk Take the rough with the smooth and vice a versa, or don't take any...

2351727330	sp33dE	2014-11-26 11:47:10	@EdMatts Have I signed up incorrectly, or is it indices are not included in any trial?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-11-27 09:20:31	@DailyDax30 You not think it will hit 10k????
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-11-27 09:24:26	@DailyDax30 Yes can see that, just asking opinion, new high over 10 or pullback before..
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-11-27 12:48:21	@DailyDax30 I thought you were having a day off!!
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-11-27 12:50:06	@DailyDax30 is the time not ready to kill the missus....
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-11-28 17:13:17	@DailyDax30 Your  a bit cryptic, but ill have a go, early dec drop late dec rally in 2013, could happen again if we get below 9943-18

2351727330	sp33dE	2014-12-18 11:15:06	@61Point8Percent as above so below, not bad if you like frights.

2351727330	sp33dE	2014-12-18 21:18:45	@61Point8Percent cheers...
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-12-19 09:42:23	@61Point8Percent Can I ask what your stop's are? do you use set amount for trades ie 30 points or look for certain level's per trade?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-12-19 09:48:26	@61Point8Percent So you trade without a stop set, watch the market and if you get close below the levels mentioned the manually close trade
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-12-19 10:16:55	@61Point8Percent The last hour is the witching hour ?
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-12-19 14:04:24	@61Point8Percent Have you seen V for vendetta, Could imagine Farage turning into a John Hurt type..
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-12-19 14:17:13	@61Point8Percent I think he went too posh school..
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-12-19 16:13:54	@61Point8Percent what about the close under 9765 on the 30 min time frame?? or did I mis-understand..
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-12-19 16:30:16	@IndexTradeChris @61Point8Percent True.. Cameron may share a pims after polo.. if your lucky or posh enough.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-12-19 17:09:43	@IndexTradeChris @61Point8Percent Yes, Im sure they would all look great in loin cloth's being chased by lion's.
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-12-19 09:53:27	@61Point8Percent Cheers for info..
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-12-19 10:07:12	@61Point8Percent Took the silver trade, 1st time I have traded silver..
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-12-19 16:34:01	@61Point8Percent @IndexTradeChris I think countries leadership should be sorted by a boxing match, top two candidates fight it out....
2351727330	sp33dE	2014-12-19 16:34:10	@61Point8Percent @IndexTradeChris To the death..
