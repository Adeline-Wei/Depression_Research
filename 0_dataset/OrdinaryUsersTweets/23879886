23879886	davidcannonvo	2012-08-26 23:34:33	I'm Cooking! And not from the heat! Early dinner it is…
23879886	davidcannonvo	2012-08-27 02:15:37	Watched 40 Days &amp; 40 Nights today. Is it normal to give up something to get over someone? I usually just get active and drink!

23879886	davidcannonvo	2012-08-27 15:29:47	It might be Monday but I am not feeling the Monday Blues..Is it because I slept well or because my weekend was so relaxing? #Mondayblues
23879886	davidcannonvo	2012-08-28 02:03:13	Nothing like a productive day with productive people! Monday blues are for unproductive people… A positive attitude brings positve results.

23879886	davidcannonvo	2014-01-05 06:21:22	Wishing I had a bottle of wine at home. Nothing like a glass of wine at the end if the day. Hmm red or white?
23879886	davidcannonvo	2014-01-06 05:39:17	Excited to start a new week tomorrow. So many great opportunities.

23879886	davidcannonvo	2014-01-04 08:50:06	@caitlinannk Well I would love to show off my moves but I am extremely busy for the next while. Another time
23879886	davidcannonvo	2014-01-04 09:00:03	Why when I come home is there not a glass of wine, a plate of appies or a paper awaiting me? Because I didn't buy any.
23879886	davidcannonvo	2014-01-04 09:37:41	@caitlinannk @UnionJackPHouse If they were open late enough I would have stopped in.
23879886	davidcannonvo	2014-01-05 23:39:59	Trying to figure out how much water I should drink in a day.
