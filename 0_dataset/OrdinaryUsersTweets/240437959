240437959	EvansT99	2011-01-24 02:51:23	Glad that after tonight we don't have to hear Rex Ryan speak until next season. Let's hope the steelers can shut up the Pack next

240437959	EvansT99	2011-01-20 03:09:18	Would be a great couple of games to be on relations staff for the wild lotnod milestones being set past few games
240437959	EvansT99	2011-01-20 04:26:43	Apparently you need to be smarter than your @BlackBerry to find the #key
240437959	EvansT99	2011-01-20 04:35:04	Who opened the flood gates for the @mnwild they are tickling the twine like nobody's business!

240437959	EvansT99	2011-02-04 02:54:30	Wonder what it would take for the Elias Sports Bureau to do my job for me. C'mon man!
240437959	EvansT99	2011-02-04 03:00:25	What has this world come to? Twitter announces a milestone before the broadcasters? How about that Elias Sports Bureau eh?
240437959	EvansT99	2011-02-01 20:07:54	Looking forward to Bruno's 1,000th #nhl game tonight #mnwild and @fsnorth will honor a #grinder tonight.

240437959	EvansT99	2011-02-11 15:24:21	$18.3 million for a replacement roof on the humpdy dump? Doesn't make sense to repair a fossil. Tear it down and start over.
240437959	EvansT99	2011-02-15 16:54:31	Got our #minnesotaTwins season tickets lined up. Wish our partner hadn't backed out so we would have four seats instead of two!

240437959	EvansT99	2011-02-17 21:24:17	@nelses1 we have wifi it was requested by the coaches. I don't think its possible for hoopsters to enlighten anyone on wcha hockey.
240437959	EvansT99	2011-02-17 21:36:48	@nelses1 I stand corrected @NateKaeding is a great hockey mind
240437959	EvansT99	2011-02-17 22:58:10	Hitting up the #pizzaranch in Wadena hope it lives up to the hype!

240437959	EvansT99	2011-03-14 13:10:45	@estromgren thoughts on game times at final5? 2 teams from Minny with 3:37 start time? UAA and CC late game? #wcha should switch to sell tix

240437959	EvansT99	2011-03-24 17:35:38	I have a feeling the word "canceled" is going to be used far too often this spring season #sickofwinter
240437959	EvansT99	2011-03-25 19:49:48	Still waiting on that #mnwild trivia question if I had quicker fingers would have won tix to last Tuesday's game.

240437959	EvansT99	2011-03-19 00:16:22	#gopher fans should be sick to their stomachs seeing what's happening at #Xcel at the #wchafinal5
240437959	EvansT99	2011-04-01 20:19:42	Was it #openingday yesterday for #mlb ? Looking forward to the #mntwins season!

240437959	EvansT99	2011-04-12 23:46:11	Did #charter really get rid of @fsnorth in HD? If so we might have to have a talk. Can't watch the #mntwins on regular cable
240437959	EvansT99	2011-02-21 23:58:48	I would like to thank the stranger who pushed my micro machine out of the snow today! She was one strong woman #payitforward
240437959	EvansT99	2011-03-20 23:14:29	I refuse to watch #mnwild game. Why? not because its ugly but because its not in HD. #ncaatourney for me once again
240437959	EvansT99	2011-03-21 00:29:08	#Texas should have been given the timeout officials have been big in the #ncaatourney #letemplay
240437959	EvansT99	2011-03-21 00:30:42	Wow #mnwild thank goodness for #mntwins and #targetfield is it summer yet?
240437959	EvansT99	2011-04-15 00:55:02	@LaVelleNeal unfortunately he is a "Coon Rapids" guy that wore that nasty Bengal blue instead of Scarlet for CR
240437959	EvansT99	2011-04-15 14:05:21	@burmee52 Keep it over on your side of the border. We do not want any more of it either! Thank you..

240437959	EvansT99	2011-04-19 20:59:47	Flashback to @robdyrdek and @BigBlack_Boykin (Rob and Big Season two) to help get through the day!
240437959	EvansT99	2011-02-24 05:14:54	No sweet spin move but found the twine a few times at open hockey tonight. Sad to hear open hockey season is winding down...
240437959	EvansT99	2011-03-24 16:27:46	Not big on spring training games but damn it was refreshing watching the #mntwins on #fsnorth last night looking forward to the #mlb season

240437959	EvansT99	2011-04-06 19:08:24	Random thought...Joe Mauer is NOT getting paid $23 million a year to sit on the bench as much as I like the guy its time to switch positions
240437959	EvansT99	2011-04-06 19:10:05	I realize its only game six and there is a lot of baseball left but the #mntwins can't afford to have his bat on the bench
240437959	EvansT99	2011-04-06 19:15:32	@JoeCStrib @StribSports @SouhanStrib @LaVelleNeal @Russostrib anybody know when the mobile website will be up and running with new site?
240437959	EvansT99	2011-04-07 04:50:40	@JuddZulgad former Gopher? It should be required to have played at least two seasons to be considered "former" #justsayin

240437959	EvansT99	2011-04-09 04:04:43	@TwinsPrez I guess I expected it to go over middle of the field from center field, sitting in 226 all we saw was the wings of one plane
240437959	EvansT99	2011-04-09 04:28:30	Had a blast at #mntwins game today hoping weather cooperates so we can enjoy another one on Sunday!

240437959	EvansT99	2011-04-15 23:52:06	@Twins_morsecode how many times has a #mntwins player been picked off so far this season? Seems to be happening a lot lately

240437959	EvansT99	2013-01-18 01:45:29	@BradFolkestad I hope I'm wrong
240437959	EvansT99	2013-01-18 01:48:56	@BradFolkestad F2 is a quick in-game roster change
240437959	EvansT99	2013-01-18 02:55:04	@BradFolkestad just one of those games you could see it coming. Turnovers and passing up good looks.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-01-18 03:51:14	Heard there was a #Bigfoot sighting in San Jose. Oh wait, that's just @Burnzie88 http://t.co/H4Gmu5CP
240437959	EvansT99	2013-01-23 01:43:04	30 stitches and he scraps 2 minutes in. Tough or stupid? #mnwild

240437959	EvansT99	2013-01-24 22:22:56	Baseball game notes. Yes you read that correctly. Baseball game notes.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-01-25 01:35:16	That was a heck of a scrap #Flyers #Rangers
240437959	EvansT99	2013-01-19 02:02:26	@SMSUMustangs against who?

240437959	EvansT99	2013-01-20 04:46:51	Love the #mnwild but seriously opener on Jan. 18 just plain old sucks for hockey rubes. With that said, welcome back boys!

240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-06 04:11:37	Seriously though why does it have to be Coon Rapids that gives the Ducks their mojo?
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-03 23:22:03	Start the clock
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-03 23:24:14	I still think national anthem to tune of "The First Noel" at the Elmen Center on Saturday night tops Alicia Keys' performance

240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-04 06:58:27	Good night from SoDak @AugieBaseball fans. Just one on the docket tmrw 10 pm start. Wish the boys some rest after 17 hrs of ball in 2 days

240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-05 04:19:12	Ok boys we're on the power play again. This time lets try to get A shot off #mnwild
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-08 01:47:31	The boo birds are out #mnwild
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-08 01:56:20	. @Russostrib said it all. The Wild have never been a team that throws the puck at the net, always looking for the pretty play.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-08 02:26:47	The #mnwild are buzzin mad right now. Need to pound one home
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-08 02:35:44	This Schneider fella is standing on his head #mnwild #Canucks

240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-09 05:19:09	. @ynotweinandt is an all-star on the tweets. We might have found you a new gig.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-09 05:26:29	@AugieBaseball hope there is a charger in that dugout!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-09 05:27:49	@AugieBaseball rain delay is not what we need then.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-09 05:28:59	@NDsportsscribe I showed your hoops bus the way to Marshall. Followed me to the freeway but I figured they could find it from there.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-09 05:39:12	@NDsportsscribe we were headed the same direction. I was eager to get home after a long day and preferred not to follow as they hit freeway
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-12 02:06:33	Ready for this #mnwild game but hoping Iggy takes it easy on us #silkymitts #sniper dude is a beast

240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-15 02:28:30	Making my first hoops trip of the season this weekend. Just a few blocks away Friday then Marshall Saturday
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-15 03:08:10	The refs are in Giggy's head lets pop another one in #mnwild
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-15 03:17:33	Used my V-Day gift from #Redbox and picked up Flight for free. Any good?
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-15 03:37:50	Let's just skip the OT and go to the shootout. Nobody scores in OT unless on a power play #mnwild
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-15 23:17:33	First time as a visiting SID this season and I feel like I'm forgetting something. If so just a few blocks away
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-16 05:30:04	@NateKaeding didn't get a chance to say what's up tonight.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-09 22:04:10	Blizzard warning for 3-5 inches of snow seems a bit extreme
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-10 01:17:45	@kjohn15 what a beaut isn't it?
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-10 04:51:23	@AugieBaseball way to close-out the trip boys. Safe travels back home. My sleep schedule is glad you're coming home.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-13 04:44:14	The #NHL needs to send its linesmen back to school and show them how to drop a puck. #dropthedarnpuckalready #pumpfake

240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-20 02:06:53	@NDsportsscribe I expect nothing but pure gold out of you
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-17 23:37:59	I'm always torn when the Wild play the Wings
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-17 23:40:13	At the same time, I'm a Homer. Go #mnwild
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-18 00:04:27	What a ripper by Datsyuk just filthy
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-18 00:18:32	Now Heater with a bomb #mnwild are buzzin
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-22 04:29:05	Ryan Smyth is a beast around the net still
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-22 04:34:37	Seto has really stepped his game up for the #mnwild couple more guys produce regularly will snowball
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-22 04:36:16	Still wish the Wild would fire more rubber at the net we have some guys who can nip but won't see It if they're looking pass first #mnwild
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-22 04:41:46	The #mnwild are one of the best teams in the corners and on the boards. Unfortunately not too many goals scored from that area of the ice
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-22 04:53:10	@KellyLoft icing on the cake
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-22 05:01:52	That was a dirty dirty hit by Hall not good
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-22 05:09:39	Brendan Shanahan is going to have to lay the smack down on Hall for that one
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-22 05:14:59	“@Russostrib: Clutterbuck in a stretcher being rolled by paramedics to Oilers medical room.” That's not a good sign
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-22 05:27:48	Unbelievable it's the final weekend of regular season hoops already #timeflieswhentimeflies
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-22 05:33:47	Chances the Wild trade for Bertuzzi or sign Marty McSorley before the next game with the Oilers? #oldtimehockey #olgieoglethorpe
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-18 00:34:15	2-on-1 you always shoot 5-hole. You either score or create rebound opportunity
240437959	EvansT99	2013-02-23 13:32:44	Girls state hockey game 6 OTs. I was there with @evanst66 in 1996 when Duluth Easy and Apple Valley played 6 OTs in the boy's tourney

240437959	EvansT99	2013-03-02 02:43:49	Managed to have my phone battery last from Sioux Falls to Aberdeen. How? Reading a book.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-03-02 03:43:49	Seriously the NHL linesmen need to just drop the puck. Your job is to call offsides and icings. That is all. No need to toss every faceoff

240437959	EvansT99	2013-03-23 04:05:29	@NateKaeding you a dribble or no dribble guy before shooting from the FT line?
240437959	EvansT99	2013-03-23 04:06:47	@Batchers preposterous statement
240437959	EvansT99	2013-03-23 04:08:10	@NateKaeding I'm thinking two would do the trick. The catch, thought, shoot looks like you'd miss a lot like that
240437959	EvansT99	2013-03-23 04:09:47	@NateKaeding the catch and shoot guy, without a dribble, is 60% from the line this season

240437959	EvansT99	2013-07-25 01:31:58	Second time since Sunday the boy twin has had to go see doc. If only the girl twin knew he was going to doc with mom and not out for fun
240437959	EvansT99	2013-07-27 02:45:10	Watching BBQ Pitmasters to get me in the right frame of mind to smoke some ribs tomorrow #BBQ #lowandslow
240437959	EvansT99	2013-07-30 02:36:23	I hate TV shows. Why? Because just when things get good. They end. That's what makes em good #lovehaterelationship
240437959	EvansT99	2013-07-31 01:25:40	Album on repeat getting ready for @ericchurch at @wefestmn headed back after 2-year hiatus http://t.co/HjqnYrSCuB

240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-02 03:32:02	Thursday night Church? Why not? @ericchurch @wefestmn  #wefest
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-05 03:20:46	Turned on ESPN at just the right time "and Delmon Young getting booed after his 4th strikeout of the night." Yup that sounds about right
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-06 02:43:18	Apparently I just missed the best pitched inning of the #MNTwins entire season
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-06 02:44:56	So that's why Carroll wasn't moved at the deadline #sleeper #MNTwins
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-10 00:06:35	Love the new #Vikings jerseys. Love it PA, BOOM!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-09 02:10:54	Took the kids out for Miracle Treat Day at DQ!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-11 01:25:37	Wow just watched the #Rays pull off the hidden ball trick!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-11 03:30:08	Wish I had an unlimited budget for gadgets both personally and professionally
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-11 03:48:33	@Ryan_Hilgemann I'd take a wireless laser printer right about now and be happy for a while
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-09 03:12:30	@nelses1 just finished episode 4 season 4. Great show but man it got sad this season
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-09 03:29:37	Looking forward to hitting the links with @AugieFB tomorrow! #GoAugie #GoViking
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-14 01:33:45	Had an semi-meltdown to start the day today. Put Kenzie in a dress and new tennis shoes at the same time. She knows what she wants
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-14 01:53:33	Crazy stretch RT@FSNtylermason: That's the first time the #MNTwins scored without a home run since Aug. 7.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-16 01:27:57	That buzz you feel in the air is the anticipation of college sports about to begin. Doesn't get any better.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-17 19:57:04	Heading out to the first @AugieFB practice of 2013!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-18 01:35:47	@J_Rinn @AugieCoachBEAR it all starts with the @AugieFB moving company #hogmollies
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-16 00:04:21	Shootouts? Need I say more?
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-16 23:08:58	Sack daddy. Another impressive first drive by the #Vikings
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-16 23:26:24	Did the #Vikings ride the struggle bus to Buffalo?
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-17 00:26:38	Gold RT @Twins_morsecode: For those that track this stat: In 18 wedding proposals this year at Target Field the #MNTwins are 10-8.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-17 00:40:45	Commercial about last season at "Mall of America Field" I know it's the new name but really? Its the H.H.H Metrodome folks
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-17 00:52:46	@DavidPetroff I get it. The Metrodome is the only stadium I've known in my lifetime before Target Field.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-17 00:54:00	@Leisch_Mike so just about anything is breaking news these days eh Leisch?
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-19 00:53:01	The last thing I would do is bean a juicer. #RoidRage
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-19 01:36:42	A-Rod looks possessed chomping on those seeds. Switch to camera 3 please
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-22 00:21:08	Back in the saddle again! Test run on volleyball stats getting @ESZahn primed for the season
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-22 03:37:37	Watching old episodes of shark week. Ummm yeah. I'll stay landlocked.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-23 00:45:32	Big thanks to @ESZahn and @cm_swish for helping make today go smoothly
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-21 22:28:28	Where did the day go?
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-22 11:27:11	People lined up to get in the fair at 6 am? #madness
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-25 15:06:29	Second straight day waking up in a panic thinking I'm late on getting kids to daycare. Thank goodness mom is off tomorrow!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-22 14:45:16	All set up for @AugieFB media day #nsicfb http://t.co/Q9nGMd8Jng
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-26 00:12:15	Really hoping this is a "preseason" thing for Ponder
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-26 00:13:43	@KatieSimons24 new game, same story...
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-29 01:11:37	Only one advantage to @meshelloevans iPhone flash not turning off. You can find the phone in a dark room even if its on silent #boom
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-26 19:57:42	Officially thinking of moving my office into the bathroom. No A/C on days like this are killin me!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-27 00:11:14	My air purifying fan that runs 365 picked a bad time to die. Hoping the stores have some in stock. #heatwave
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-27 02:39:44	My new fan has a remote control. So that is pretty neat. #technology
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-27 20:12:04	So I lost two pages of type for my week 1 game notes. Kudos to me for not SAVING!!!!!!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-28 00:04:17	I'm starting to think daycare providers send your daughter home with a head full of rubber bands just to torture you.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-27 19:57:58	Blue screen of death just flashed on my screen as I was deep into my week 1 game notes #SIDproblems? no #SIDnightmares
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-30 14:13:13	Jock jams remix on the radio on drive in today! Pump up the jam on a Friday!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-30 14:57:32	@peglegMegMard @GretchASketch8 you'll never guess what was played in the office this morning... http://t.co/4AfnQbj8S9
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-31 04:01:15	Does anybody else just want to hear Craig Bohl call someone a slacker? #backtothefuture
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-31 19:40:29	Absolutely hate the Morneau trade #mntwins
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-29 23:09:03	No cable. No problems. Go Rodents! http://t.co/CsV7GwDIyp
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-30 02:38:45	I love college football. That is all.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-08-30 02:45:43	The days of recognizing a team by their uniforms are over
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-01 23:42:32	Looking forward to hearing the conversation about the #RMShowdown by my Coloradan GA's @ESZahn and @cm_swish
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-05 22:42:32	The kids turned our chest freezer to the lowest possible temp. Come over if you're curious what rotting meat smells like. #wellplayed
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-06 01:47:06	What a start to @NorthernSunConf football tonight by @BSUBeavers and @WSUWarriors #nsicfb
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-06 04:15:40	One of the dumbest plays I have ever seen right there #BALvsDEN
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-06 04:22:20	How do you talk back to your coach after a bonehead play like that? #BALvsDEN
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-06 04:25:40	And the #ButtFumble reign is over?
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-04 14:47:34	Hit. Every. Single. Red. Light. on my way to work this morning

240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-07 13:03:45	The @AugustanaTrack Twilight was a great way to start the weekend!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-11 00:54:13	Didn't get to a single ball game this summer. That's just sad!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-11 00:57:18	@MikeHenriksen just a bit! Family has season tickets too! Bad timing all summer I guess!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-11 00:59:00	@BrettHansen9 I should clarify, a @Twins  game
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-08 03:00:09	That happened because he's a QB that thinks he can wear a D-lineman number #NDvsMICH
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-12 00:10:47	Who's ready for some #NHL? I know I am!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-12 03:15:16	Not so sure about that call reversal in #mntwins game tonight. Foreshadowing on how video replay will ruin the game? #MLB
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-13 02:41:29	RT @6ErikJohnson: What is wrong with these guys?! Run in the end zone before you drop the ball!!!!! #TexasTech
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-13 02:44:04	Dropping the ball to celebrate before you get in the end zone = BENCHED!!! @cm_swish
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-13 02:53:34	Of the 4 minutes of this #TCUvsTTU game it's apparent the #replacementrefs still got it
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-13 01:30:12	Nicest night we've had in a while. Was nice to spend some time outside even if kids were overly tired and crabby!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-13 01:32:01	Was surprised with my latest eye exam that prescription didn't change much. I feel like my vision has got worse.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-13 01:32:35	That said, cannot wait for my @oakley prescription glasses to get in!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-14 14:54:30	Yes that is a Dora band aid. Hoping her and Boots can keep me going through 4 vball matches #sidproblems http://t.co/3iqSi4SIce
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-14 01:43:22	The harder the battle, the sweeter the victory.

240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-15 17:05:09	Some alien said he wasn't worthy of wearing #84 #Vikings
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-15 17:07:56	You just knew Hester was going to take that one out #Vikings #Bears
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-15 17:35:26	It doesn't matter how open receivers are when your line cannot protect the QB #Vikings
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-15 17:52:01	Wonder what Brett Favre is up to these days... #Vikings
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-17 23:43:25	Time to do something with the 8.2 GB of photos on my iPhone
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-21 03:30:26	Today definitely did not feel like a Friday
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-19 00:21:54	Upgraded to #iOS7 it's definitely different but I like it!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-19 00:48:23	Started the #iOS7 upgrade on the iPad. Started off at 6 hours remaining....down to 3. Phone took 45 minutes
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-19 00:53:30	Just realized the #iOS7 upgrade deleted me iCal subscriptions
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-19 01:15:08	Agree. Especially once the kinks get worked out “@hanshoeg: iOS 7... Stellar."
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-24 01:22:46	@Ryan_Hilgemann I chuckled when I saw the lineup we were throwing out there tonight
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-19 12:37:54	I asked Siri what she thought of #iOS7 and she said "I'm sorry I can't answer that."
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-25 02:31:35	@BrettHansen9 like Shaggy said. "It wasn't me"
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-22 20:12:04	We could just as well get rid of the dome now. Or at least keep it as a year round college/high school baseball facility
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-22 20:18:39	And Ponder sacks himself

240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-26 04:27:39	Might end all tweets with #ToddFather for a while just because I can
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-26 04:28:28	No joke though. MLB 2010 on PS3, #ToddFather goes yard just about every at bat #InToddWeTrust
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-27 01:03:22	The tank is empty.

240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-28 02:04:21	@ynotweinandt minus the one play where you were checking out the student section! Otherwise solid!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-09-28 03:44:44	Just turned on both CFB games on watch ESPN on game player gets carted off with neck injury. Next a nasty what looks like dislocation

240437959	EvansT99	2013-10-21 03:44:17	Colts dropping like flies. Maybe they're just trying to slow the game down
240437959	EvansT99	2013-10-21 03:47:36	My bro inlaw came to our football game this wknd, first D2 game ever. Said was fun to watch a game where players don't celebrate every play
240437959	EvansT99	2013-10-21 03:56:18	All that work. Ouch that's a fumble.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-10-22 00:20:41	#Vikings game blacked out on #WatchESPN so there's that.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-10-22 02:39:42	"This is a terrible game. Both of these teams are just B-A-D" HAHAHAH #MNF
240437959	EvansT99	2013-10-22 02:53:20	Freeman looks frustrated. He's only been here for 3 quarters... #Vikings
240437959	EvansT99	2013-10-22 03:11:23	Good night.

240437959	EvansT99	2013-10-22 03:21:09	Anyone agree with Gruden on his comments about Ponder? I don't.
240437959	EvansT99	2013-10-22 03:23:06	@KatieSimons24 Ponder is a good QB. He's won some games in this league...
240437959	EvansT99	2013-10-24 00:44:47	The air during my run tonight was reminiscent of outdoor hockey
240437959	EvansT99	2013-10-26 13:54:36	Hard to believe it's championship season already
240437959	EvansT99	2013-10-27 23:21:24	Made a nice little #SNF dinner tonight. BBQ chicken nachos. #Yum

240437959	EvansT99	2013-11-02 03:26:55	54 fouls in exhibition game tonight. Serious about that hand check!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-11-03 19:44:43	You have to run the ball in that situation! We have AP give yourself a cushion!
240437959	EvansT99	2013-11-01 02:45:34	Nobody stopped by for candy tonight. Guess we're stuck with the Reese's #darn #score
240437959	EvansT99	2013-11-02 03:31:36	@nelses1 can you imagine 100 fouls and 12 media timeouts per game X2????
240437959	EvansT99	2013-11-02 13:20:03	@KellyLoft 6 per game yes. But with m/w doubleheaders each weekend, 12 medias per night...
240437959	EvansT99	2013-11-07 04:49:09	@peglegMegMard stick it to the man and drop it!

240437959	EvansT99	2013-11-24 21:01:14	This review kills Vikes, play clock was under 5 seconds and Pack didn't look ready to snap

240437959	EvansT99	2013-12-02 23:45:13	Random dog followed me my entire run tonight right to my front door. Snuck up behind me a couple times and scared the bejesus out of me
240437959	EvansT99	2013-12-04 05:00:40	Nice win for the Gophs tonight. Funny to see the causal college hoops fans' thoughts on rule changes 9 games into the season...

240437959	EvansT99	2014-02-15 15:21:47	Crazy format for shootout but that was fun to watch #USAvsRUS
240437959	EvansT99	2014-02-21 17:32:21	That PP really changed the momentum of this game. Quick standing on his head for #USA #USAvsCanada

240437959	EvansT99	2014-03-06 20:51:36	Pretty sweet listening to Gary Thorne calling high school hockey state tourney in Minny

240437959	EvansT99	2014-03-29 14:56:57	Two days of baseball/softball could be rough without the shades. Left em in the other car

240437959	EvansT99	2014-03-31 02:30:06	Pinch hit homers. Is ball season
240437959	EvansT99	2014-03-31 13:54:36	It's a great day to be a baseball fan #MLBOpeningDay
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-01 01:28:51	Drove to work with the windows down. Drove home with the heat on
240437959	EvansT99	2014-03-31 18:31:25	Don't know how I feel about challenges in baseball
240437959	EvansT99	2014-03-31 18:42:22	Can we put up goal posts for umpires to dunk on after they get their calls upheld by replay?
240437959	EvansT99	2014-03-31 18:50:18	Well baseball is back Twins fans. We get to see another ex-Twin having a day in another team's uniform
240437959	EvansT99	2014-03-31 20:22:53	Just witnessed, on webcast, first overturned call on instant replay. They got it right. I guess that's all that matters right?
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-02 02:37:54	Seriously though. I need to find out how to stop Microsoft Word from autocorrecting Tim, to Tiny Tim. Also need to find out who did this

240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-10 02:36:58	Witnessed two older dudes both driving Jeep Wranglers give each other the nod and wave of approval while passing by
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-10 02:37:25	And to think that was my dream car growing up. Look what I'm missing out on

240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-11 23:40:43	Having a lovely Friday night. No live stats for doubleheader and going on 40 minutes w/o game files #sidproblems
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-11 02:49:27	Not even enough time to tweet about the goal and that green team scores #FrozenFour
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-11 02:59:20	Dump and chase hockey. Need to dump with a purpose otherwise you're just giving away possessions
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-11 03:03:50	My goodness that was close #FrozenFour
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-11 03:04:29	If we get there this means Minny gets the make up call in OT right? #FrozenFour
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-11 03:07:19	That's a goal baby! #Gophers #FrozenFour
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-11 03:10:32	If you didn't know any better one would think this was the first game Barry and Bucci have ever called
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-17 00:21:28	This is baseball weather in the north country!
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-17 01:29:03	I remember the last run like it was yesterday. Looking forward to another long spring for the #mnwild #BecauseItsTheCup
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-18 04:20:44	I wouldn't be surprised if we see Patty Roy and Matt Cooke get into it at some point this series #mnwild #BecauseItsTheCup
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-18 04:25:27	How many coaches pull their goalie with that much time left? Paid off with great puck control

240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-18 04:41:49	Hopefully the ice is still tilted the same direction as it was in the third period
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-18 01:16:47	Was hoping to see @BrettHansen9 at the @SFSkyforce game tonight but I guess he got the night off
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-18 03:54:32	Avs were buzzing and they got the Mo on their side now
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-18 04:24:24	That puck has got to get out of the zone
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-18 04:42:27	Off the iron!!!
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-18 04:50:45	Well this feels about right.

240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-22 00:38:10	@KellyLoft @AaronZ_21 that's even more debatable
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-19 20:37:52	Apparently in college softball you can have artificial noise makers in the dugout.

240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-19 20:41:52	@DavidPetroff We're in the 5th inning of game two. I'm going to ask about after the game

240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-27 04:14:59	Should haven been hold. Should have been offsides. But you cant sit on your heels and take it and dump for 8 minutes
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-27 04:17:01	We scored two goals in less than 2 minutes and had all the momentum then we sit back and let them back in the game
240437959	EvansT99	2014-04-27 23:44:53	Love it when my phone blows up after our teams win championships

240437959	EvansT99	2015-02-24 03:56:31	@tfredmuggs absolutely a stretch. When you realize the ad you watched was twice the length of the highlight. I'll never get that time back!
