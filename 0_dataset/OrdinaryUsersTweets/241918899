241918899	JustLizziee	2013-09-18 20:31:22	"Why do we close our eyes when we pray, cry, kiss or dream? Because the most beautiful things in life our not seen but felt by the heart"
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-09-18 21:12:11	The first thing I see when I wake up &amp; the last thing before I fall asleep... Yes twitter it's you
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-09-23 23:19:56	How can I still be up doing this art? I don't know what was going through my brain when I decided to choose the subject
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-09-21 10:51:38	Just finished training at track, that was the most intense training session I've had in a while

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-09-21 20:40:28	The idea of my friends &amp; I growing apart after yr 11 actually scares me omg
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-09-24 20:56:51	I love having friends I can just vent to

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-09-23 17:55:41	Art gives me too much stress
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-10-01 05:01:32	5 hours of sleep is not enough enough, what was I thinking #morningregrets
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-09-30 06:01:24	I think I might just sleep through science today

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-09-28 18:01:57	when it comes down to it, I can say I'm an honest person, I don't hide what I think or feel, the people that know me know that
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-09-28 18:04:46	@ItsMaisiee the irony

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-11-21 19:21:00	Getting 100 likes on Instagram doesn't make you pretty, just shows how great photo editing/technology has become

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-11-28 18:41:55	When @KatGraham isn't tweeting I get worried, but I know if she could she'd spent every day with her fans on twitter (':

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-11-30 23:53:10	All these 'sharquisha' jokes are actually quite bad the fact that people think its actually funny to be treated like that. Not pleased
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-01 12:30:33	RIP Paul Walker gone too soon.
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-01 13:14:45	I feel so sad for Paul walker &amp; his family, keeping them in my prayers. Just goes to show money isn't everything, happiness in life is
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-01 13:31:56	Why do my closet friends have to live far from me? Wish we all lived in the same neighbourhood
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-01 13:37:49	Sundays are just so depressing, just knowing its the last 24 hours you have to enjoy before you're back to school in the morning...
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-11-30 22:34:31	@Mimiatu yeah I'm sure you're going to LOVE it, I know I did

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-07 14:22:06	I feel so betrayed when I make it so clear that I'm about to have a bath, then someone else goes to use the bathroom
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-07 14:42:10	@Preshoble @MissChloeLennon @Cheeeryl_ love these girls, we honestly have too much fun in English, i hope miss NEVER splits us up ahaha (':

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-13 22:19:03	You know life is worth the struggle when you look back on what you had and realise what you have is so much better

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-14 17:34:01	The sound of the wind fighting the trees outside is so irritating
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-14 19:03:19	So only my girl @HiiiPower_Est would have actual original timberlands, she just keeps on killing em
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-14 19:43:22	I'm remember trying to stay up late as a child to see Father Christmas

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-24 19:39:32	So I'm not on twitter for a while &amp; then I come back to find my timeline filled with pictures of barbies? I'm so lost

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-24 20:20:32	So family time in my house has turned into everyone on some sort of electrical device, using the same wifi hotspot, in the same room
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-24 20:28:21	the amount of times @HiiiPower_Est has reminded me its her bday tomorrow is ridiculous, I don't care you 15 year old... Love you (:

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-25 01:00:14	Ok so I should be sleeping now, seeing as I'm serving at church tomorrow morning &amp; all
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-25 01:04:02	OMG it's Christmas, could you people stop with the suicidal, dramatic &amp; cringy relationship tweets for just one day?
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-25 01:06:33	So everyone's either sleeping or doing Christmassy activities &amp; I'm just watching old episodes of breaking bad (:
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-25 01:07:09	There's only six more days of 2013
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-25 01:11:02	So my all nighter failed, just been sent to bed my dad, I'm hurt :(

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-25 19:53:25	I was so easily fooled by my family when I was little to believe that Father Christmas existed
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-25 22:54:10	Happy holidays (: http://t.co/G9KxDsmoMT

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-22 12:37:56	So Christmas is actually in three days? Doesn't feel like it. At all.
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-22 12:41:26	I don't understand why everyone's saving for college shopping? You go to college to learn, it's not dress to impress
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-28 11:10:41	My baby's @HiiiPower_Est birthday dinner tonight at soho, so excited (:

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-27 12:20:55	I'd hate to work in a pharmacy, the place seems so depressing
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-27 18:07:45	I love eating out
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-30 12:58:37	Had a really nice weekend for @HiiiPower_Est 16th birthday, thanks for having me girl (:
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-30 15:06:04	As much as I try, I just can't understand some people
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-30 15:25:29	Omg my mum just prank called me -____- I had no idea it was her, she was actually pretty good
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-30 15:29:23	I highly doubt college is the time to be trying to make all new friends, it's only 2 years.
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-30 16:15:31	@HiiiPower_Est naa, it's only 2 years that will probs fly by. I think uni is when you make the friends you'll keep for the rest of your life
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-01-01 01:23:30	Thank you to all my friends who followed me into 2014 &amp; all those I left behind in 2013 making me realise the value of true friendship
241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-30 21:40:15	Just too shady, I can't deal
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-01-01 13:25:39	Going for dinner later con mi familia de mi Madre's birthday (:

241918899	JustLizziee	2013-12-31 16:19:31	It's crazy to think that other countries are already in the new year

241918899	JustLizziee	2014-04-24 18:45:29	Physics is like death
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-04-29 16:33:14	2 hour art exam starting tomorrow :0
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-04-28 20:47:54	@KatGraham is always saying happy birthday to her fans, it's nice to know she cares
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-04-28 07:17:56	I wish I could just skip Monday

241918899	JustLizziee	2014-04-30 17:25:55	Art has killed me. It might as well slit my wrists for me
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-05 10:30:08	24: live another day is so good. My dad and brother have me obsessed
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-05 10:32:10	Canada water library has become a bait spot for social gatherings, the cover up is 'revision' but very few actually do so
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-03 18:15:51	Personally I struggle to revise in the day, so when I sleep all day it's not coz I don't care to study, it just means I'll be up all night
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-05 14:27:47	@habi_gel I'm not sure tbh
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-05 14:31:58	I think about school work &amp; then fall asleep, school is messing with me mentally now
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-03 22:44:13	Sleep all day, work at night. I'm nocturnal
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-05 15:17:19	Getting to know my circle, taken five years but hey, I'm getting there
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-03 22:31:02	Typical night, staying up late at the dining table doing work, while my dad relaxes on the sofa binge watching 24
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-03 22:45:39	Can we skip to the part where I'm opening my envelope and seeing amazing grades
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-06 07:15:00	These next four weeks of school is make or break for me, I need to work so hard
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-06 16:03:08	When people take out their frustration on you /: I'm not the one boo
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-06 16:07:18	First written exam is in 6 days :0
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-08 15:17:55	Not this again.
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-09 21:28:17	So Maisie rings me up crying her eyes out...&amp; it's because of vampire diaries -_-
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-09 21:31:26	Stefan's dead. Katherine's dead. And the elena we all knew and loved is also dead. I'm so done. #VampireDiaries
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-09 21:37:47	Okay so... Tell me when they bring Stefan back (; until then deuces #VampireDiaries
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-09 21:48:19	@julieplec I thought you loved the fans though? How does killing Stefan come Into that? I'm heartbroken. #VampireDiaries
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-09 21:51:04	@julieplec make me a vampire so I can grab Elena's cold heart from her chest myself.
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-10 14:32:06	Love the way I can have my friends over even when I'm looking like crap #NoNewFriends #ForgetAFakeFriend
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-10 14:39:34	I think my life is actually going to begin when I start driving, I can't wait
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-10 15:28:04	Revision seems to be harder than actually taking the exam
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-11 20:18:39	Good luck to everyone that has exams starting tomorrow! Kill em
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-11 20:41:52	After exams I'm going to be twerking on ceilings and that 😂

241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-17 00:07:04	Bamon is stupid give it up guys, it will never happen. #VampireDiaries
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-17 21:03:58	Not everyday print screen my snapchats. Sometimes accept that you'll never see the picture again
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-18 22:03:44	People complaining about mock exams. They are fake. Count yourself lucky.
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-17 21:08:42	Arsenals first big win in how many years please? Oh yeah I lost count
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-18 22:46:25	English literature is actually an amazing subject, we just all suffer from teachers that do not know how to execute the subject well
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-18 23:12:51	I'm going to be so dead in double English tomorrow -_-
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-17 23:05:43	Stop Channing with my Tatum

241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-24 01:46:21	Happy birthday Charlotte! Love you baby girl http://t.co/YBnNVmn0nu
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-25 23:53:19	It's so easy to lose your morals &amp; be easily persuaded by everyone around you. But everyday you see it's thanks to God's mercy
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-26 00:55:38	There's people with no food to eat &amp; no place to sleep but yet with all we have to be thankful for, we still complain.
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-26 00:56:46	So many people ask me what I want to be &amp; truthfully, I just want to be a good person.
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-26 00:59:09	I tend to say I'm a Christian, but I want my actions to speak for themselves. After all actions speak much louder than words.
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-26 13:58:06	We need to focus on the things in life that actually matter
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-27 16:38:58	Awkward moment when a dudes hair is curlier than yours..
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-27 20:18:37	I can't wait to be released from the vicious beast I call school
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-27 16:49:08	Saying in going to take an hour break from studying, then 3 hours pass...
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-28 20:17:49	Dr Maya ANGELou, rest in peace. Angels really do come in disguise. #RIPMayaAngelou

241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-31 15:20:34	I hate snap chats that are really short, you blink &amp; they're gone -_-
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-31 15:21:31	“@SixSecondSongs: Take a bow 💁 https://t.co/1MTxchFKp8” I wish this lasted more than 6 seconds #flawless
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-30 15:40:15	Half terms practically over, I'm heart broken :(

241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-30 16:06:35	Getting in the bath at 5pm has actually become the norm for me this week
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-31 18:33:22	Who else thinks they should just scrap science as a subject :)
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-30 21:34:12	@KatGraham why won't you come to London? :(
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-05-30 22:38:15	I need to get used to this no TVD every Friday night thing
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-01 18:00:09	It's easy to make friends, keeping them is the issue
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-01 20:25:50	my final exam is on Friday 13th -_-
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-03 06:37:38	English language exam today, good luck  everyone, we are going to need stamina to write for 2 hours straight
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-02 22:06:25	Tamar Braxton makes me laugh so much, I love her
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-04 20:55:58	Um someone's slightly obsessed with me..@ItsMaiss http://t.co/sB1baVl2Y9
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-03 21:11:22	I wish all my friends could get along, hate being in a position where I feel I need to choose
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-03 21:24:11	Chewing the straw has hit an all time low... http://t.co/fJX8gFHmQ0
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-04 20:36:54	Not everyday low batts @ItsMaiss -_-

241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-04 21:32:50	I'm happy to say I left my secondary school with no beef with anyone :)
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-05 20:21:36	B5 is an enemy of progress
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-04 21:05:20	Last day of school today, its sad to think I'll never see some people again but the people who matter are the ones I'll ride or die with :)
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-06 11:59:35	Weathers so nice, it's starting to feel like SUMMERRRR
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-06 12:01:52	Please God, let me do well in my science exams and bless me with low grade boundaries. Amen
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-06 16:10:10	When adults analyse my outfit on the bus... Just because I'm a teenager it doesn't mean I dress inappropriately. I'm morally upright, thanks
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-06 16:12:53	People who have their phone on loud speaker on the bus -_- so considerate...
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-06 16:15:40	These boys talking about football players &amp; how much they earn. Aw cute how much do y'all earn?
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-06 16:16:36	I'm so glad biology is over, now I need to do chemistry &amp; physics then it's a wrap for science ;)
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-07 18:54:23	School should have finished yesterday because at this point I'm just over it.
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-08 11:51:51	I don't really care about what anyone's wearing at prom tbh, I just want to DANCEEEEEEE

241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-10 11:40:48	The weather always seems to be nice when I have a science exam

241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-11 20:21:40	Just finished my cookie dough Ice cream. It was nice but that's the point. I'm depressed, exams are stress.
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-11 20:28:22	Now Trying to settle down to revise is so hard, especially when all I can think about is summer
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-11 20:29:44	I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm hungry. I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm tired. But I still smile...I'm thankful because I'm blessed.
241918899	JustLizziee	2014-06-11 20:32:50	Two days til summer tho. TWO DAYS. It feels like 2 weeks but it's ok. Because it's just two days. I can do this
