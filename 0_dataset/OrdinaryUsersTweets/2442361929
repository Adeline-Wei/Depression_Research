2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-24 21:16:56	I kind of fancy Jimmy Bullard! I think it could be because I think that is what Harry Styles will look like when he's older😕.

2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-27 17:11:35	Shattered after placement today 😴 wouldn't have it any other way though! I ❤️ it.
2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-27 19:57:01	Can't decide how I want my nails done
2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-30 19:22:25	I have about 80 Christmas cards to write out for the kids at placement!
2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-30 19:23:27	And I'm going to have to start wrapping Christmas presents because Ryan is too nosey and will try look at them
2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-30 19:42:11	I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya.
2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-30 20:32:36	I am awful at wrapping presents !!!
2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-30 13:15:00	So jealous of people that are putting up their Christmas decorations and trees😥
2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-30 14:33:19	Why did I start drinking wine last night???? 🍷😷
2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-30 14:54:47	@holmeschaprauhl id be so upset if that happened! I just want to decorate everything and get al Christmassy!! X

2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-30 15:12:50	@holmeschaprauhl think I might just have to do that x
2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-30 15:15:28	@Nicola118 so he was dan Douglas drunk then?? Was he drinking wine then I'm guessing? X
2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-30 15:17:53	@Nicola118 hope he's paying for it today then! X
2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-30 22:51:18	I had 2 glasses of wine last night and I've had a headache all day! Think wine doesn't agree with me 😖
2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-29 11:52:24	Tea, toast and #Hollyoaks catch up!
2442361929	_littletess	2014-11-29 12:55:25	More Christmas shopping today! 🎅🎄🎁❄️⛄️

2442361929	_littletess	2014-12-03 19:31:20	@dannypattyd did she give you yours early then?
2442361929	_littletess	2014-12-03 15:53:32	Went town to get some Christmas presents but I ended up getting myself an Olaf Christmas jumper ❤️⛄️.
2442361929	_littletess	2014-12-03 16:20:56	Can I live in it please? http://t.co/r1fqdOkpJ4

2442361929	_littletess	2014-12-04 20:41:43	There is actually no better feeling than someone making you happy and knowing you make them just as happy ☺️.
2442361929	_littletess	2014-12-04 18:22:35	Haven't watched celeb since @jimmybullard left 😤
2442361929	_littletess	2014-12-04 19:57:20	Spend an hour and a half writing 69 Christmas cards for the children at placement!

2442361929	_littletess	2014-12-06 23:44:18	Nothing better than having someone to cuddle every night ☺️
2442361929	_littletess	2014-12-05 23:02:21	If you don’t end up smiling while you are kissing someone, you are probably kissing the wrong person just saying
2442361929	_littletess	2014-12-07 13:24:04	@Charlottegshore and @GazGShore are my favourite couple / not couple ever!!! 💖
2442361929	_littletess	2014-12-07 14:48:57	Wrapping Christmas presents while watching sleeping beauty 🎁👸 #chilledsunday
2442361929	_littletess	2014-12-08 08:06:14	I would much rather be staying in bed today than be going college
2442361929	_littletess	2014-12-07 15:01:46	I would wrap some presents but I've ran out of sellotape 😐 guess I'll just have to watch sleeping beauty without wrapping then! 😄

2442361929	_littletess	2014-12-06 13:02:51	I really don't understand how some people can go from speaking pretty much every day to not even saying hi to each other.
2442361929	_littletess	2014-12-08 19:04:30	@loz_ww here's an early Christmas present, enjoy :) x http://t.co/dpNmYRbdC1
