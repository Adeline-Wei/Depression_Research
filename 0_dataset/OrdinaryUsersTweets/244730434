244730434	danileal524	2014-10-01 22:05:36	The meeting will cover the strategic plan of structuring the university and will be followed by questions and answers.
244730434	danileal524	2014-10-01 22:08:19	"The objective of this strategic plan is to cultivate a learning centered community," said Provost of Loyola University, Marc Manganaro
244730434	danileal524	2014-10-01 22:14:02	Overview (draft) of the plan #LoynoSGA #TownHall http://t.co/n3I083gwfT
244730434	danileal524	2014-10-01 22:14:20	First student government association has now begun. #LoynoSGA
244730434	danileal524	2014-10-01 22:22:09	The restructuring of the models of the colleges have been going on for a few years, according to Manganaro.
244730434	danileal524	2014-10-01 22:25:49	The restructuring would dissolve the College of Social Sciences. What do you think? #LoynoSGA #TownHall
244730434	danileal524	2014-10-01 22:29:34	The majority of the current School of Mass Comm faculty and staff are opposed the merging of the arts and mass communication.
244730434	danileal524	2014-10-01 22:30:46	"It is extremely important that we created structures that enhance collaboration," said Manganaro. #LoynoSGA #TownHall
244730434	danileal524	2014-10-01 22:36:03	Students are actively listening to Marc Manganaro while he speaks about the university's restructuring plan. http://t.co/UDYPzGRAME
244730434	danileal524	2014-10-01 22:41:32	"Since we recognize that diversity is our strength, we now have to focus on student success," said Cissy Petty, VP of Student Affairs
244730434	danileal524	2014-10-01 22:45:30	The primary focus remains on the merger of the College of Music and the School of Mass Communication. #TownHall
244730434	danileal524	2014-10-01 22:47:49	Mass Comm students are reassured that they will still be receiving a degree from that school, regardless of the merge.
244730434	danileal524	2014-10-01 22:57:55	Our goal is to become a more residential college, but it probably won't happen for another decade, according to Dr. Petty.
244730434	danileal524	2014-10-01 22:59:27	Roberta Kaskel, Vice President of Enrollment Management, closes the meeting by welcoming 725 new Loyola undergrads and taking questions.
