250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-02-23 16:45:54	@Gamma_F3 @gump_f3 @phatnode the carry was fine... It was the partner squats that hurt a bit #bunnyhate
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-02-23 16:47:48	@TheNickFoy @mattmartella @phatnode that's what we get for #bunny filming us all night.  "These look a lot easier than they are!"
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-02-23 03:10:37	@TheNickFoy @laurenpyles not any longer...
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-02-23 21:19:10	@mcmiraclemujer still bathing y'all in prayer.  Keep on growing Liam!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-02-23 23:25:34	I registered for the Run the Creek 5k on March 16th,  how about you @F3Highlands ?
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-02-24 23:50:55	Nice! “@TonyMayhoff: Awesome day - got to hang with @MatthewBerryTMR and his wonderful wife at their first #NASCAR race. Thanks guys!”
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-02 15:19:34	@AshleyZaepfel answer:  run in the snow.  #solutions #itsnotthatcold
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-06 00:40:10	@bmeritt93 @f3bogey @friday_f3 are there tickets for sale? #frontrow #whosgotnext
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-01 17:05:51	@gump_F3 @sleuth @phatnode you're my boy #Bunny!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-01 17:07:16	“@Friday_F3: @sleuth @F3Nation @GORUCK @bpatnode Great Video! Great Song Choice!  Great Leadership! #421” @phatnode is the real #bunny
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-07 18:02:12	@naeemfazal sounds like fun.  You should definitely go
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-09 16:56:06	First Lowe's Build and Grow experience with the boys was a huge success... http://t.co/efQ4S4tdKV
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-05 01:48:55	Fantastic dinner with my beautiful wife @laurenpyles celebrating our anniversary!  #betterthanideserve #7yearsnoitching
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-12 12:56:14	@F3Malkovich will the 2013 race jerseys arrive by Friday? #Highlands has a 5k we're supporting on Saturday
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-08 11:49:23	@F3Highlands 5 for a Speed workout led by @TheNanny_F3
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-13 23:52:14	@gump_F3 sick son, so I'm out
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-14 00:02:48	@gump_F3 didn't help that it was a quick move to today.  Plans were already made for most I would guess
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-15 20:18:41	@TonyGrossi any thoughts on Brandon Myers for the Browns?  Latest on Cason?
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-20 22:46:52	This is the beginning of a new era of Pyles family baseball #cantwait #tooexcited http://t.co/I8kXiC3dDP
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-20 22:55:14	@gump_F3 Lane gets the black one and Cullen gets the brown one.  Have to be different colors so they don't argue over whose they are
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-22 20:14:24	@wild_banshee did you hear how RJ's pro day went?
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-22 20:17:54	@wild_banshee roger that.  Just thought you might be "in the know"
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-22 23:31:50	Aaron Craft is a BOSS.  That is all #GoBucks
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-24 18:38:26	@go2hellcarolina disagree wholeheartedly.  Refs were inconsistent all game.  That loose ball fall on Scott gets called 3/10 times
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-24 18:40:45	@go2hellcarolina don't get the issue with the charge call. Agree on moving screen, but there were a dozen others not called on ISU on threes
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-24 18:43:35	@go2hellcarolina ok, you're right... And you and Chuck are in agreement... Not a great position normally
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-24 18:44:24	@go2hellcarolina then you won't enjoy the rest of the tournament!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-24 18:47:26	@go2hellcarolina huge mistake.  I was really worried about Iowa St. Didn't like the matchup. I'll take what I can get to survive and advance
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-31 01:37:55	I'm irrationally upset for how terrible the Buckeyes have played tonight.
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-26 01:32:54	@TheNickFoy @prodigalsam oh... They certainly do.  Mostly said in reference to Eric Church, but also "ten thousand reasons" by Matt Redman
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-28 10:44:14	Question of the day:  where was @gump_F3 this morning?!? Also notably absent was @TheNanny_F3
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-03-27 20:09:40	@gump_F3 phenomenal!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-01 18:05:45	@gump_F3 you gonna treat us to the Vern on Thursday?
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-10 18:58:57	@Loop_F3 I have an FNG for ME on Friday.  Pressure's on...
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-10 19:00:54	@Loop_F3 his very first.  Been trying to get him to come out.
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-10 21:21:53	Stand by @F3Highlands... #gulfstream is on the Q tomorrow. Saw a preview... Looks really easy #sarcasm #uhoh
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-12 10:55:59	Hey @phatnode... @toddphelps has been to one more #f3nation workout than you this week.  Just sayin'
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-11 01:04:11	@Gamma_F3 aye!  See you soon
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-12 14:50:27	@TheNanny_F3 @col_mustard_f3 was that your first tweet?!?  #col_mustard should feel honored
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-10 11:23:26	"New Testament summarized in 3 words: adoption through propitiation" -J.I.Packer in Knowing God.  Wow!  Such a perfect summary
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-16 10:31:01	Thanks men! “@col_mustard_F3: @thejeffpyles @F3Highlands @Skipper_F3 @gump_F3 happy b-day to our F3 brother shazam http://t.co/bzLUKu5OgK”
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-16 16:59:09	@F3Isotope what seems to be the preferred #F3regionalgear shirt?  Racing core or b-tech?
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-17 16:17:37	@gump_F3 beautiful!  So happy to hear...
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-17 22:27:00	@gump_F3 @Gamma_F3 I will be at HDHH but won't post until 7ish
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-22 02:03:34	If you aren't watching this Hallmark Hall of Fame movie (and loving it...), I'm not sure we can be friends @laurenpyles #imasucker
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-19 19:16:33	Question for @F3Highlands, who will post their backblast first: @gump_F3 (Thu) or @col_mustard_F3 (last Sat)?
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-19 19:21:29	@col_mustard_F3 @gump_f3 I'm taking bets... Not a lot of action on the colonel's side
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-19 19:26:29	@Skipper_F3 @col_mustard_f3 @gump_f3 that is a contemplative pose... Not one seen often at an @F3Highlands workout
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-19 19:29:46	@col_mustard_F3 @skipper_f3 @gump_f3 let's not get off-topic... Is a backblast forthcoming?
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-19 18:07:24	@go2hellcarolina it's the most Cleveland thing ever
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-19 19:38:09	@dchiefd what do most of the pax go with for F3 shirts?  Racing core or b-tech?
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-19 19:41:39	@drivethru_f3 @dchiefd Aye!  Thanks.
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-24 17:36:51	@TheNickFoy we certainly will be brother
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-25 17:50:50	@TheNickFoy phenomenal news!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-25 10:25:27	Hey @TheNickFoy all of @F3Highlands prayed for Theo this morning.  Our thoughts and prayers will be with you all #prayfortheo
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-25 16:38:29	“@TheNickFoy: Whitney's surgeon said all went well on exit. Now they are working on Theo. Going great so far. #prayfortheo” will keep prayin
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-26 14:07:14	@TheNickFoy that is fantastic!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-04-30 18:23:42	@TheNickFoy prayers going up brother!  #prayfortheo
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-02 11:31:52	@JasonSobelGC which 9 players withdrew this week?

250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-03 21:13:42	@MiniMe_F3 @Friday_F3 I'll be late to Q school.  Just getting off the bus at Carowinds from the tournament.  #Trafficsucks

250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-06 18:38:03	@col_mustard_F3 @gump_f3 @gamma_f3 30 isn't bad. 31 on the other hand... Love you brothers and looking forward to tomorrow
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-07 12:06:48	@TheNickFoy @prodigalsam co-sign.  Keep up the good work.
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-08 14:51:53	@TheNickFoy I've literally never been happier hearing about someone pooping!  #awesome #GodIsGood
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-06 10:41:36	Was dreading the work week... Posted in the deluge this am and now I'm ready for anything! #truth @F3Highlands @F3Isotope
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-08 21:54:46	@gump_F3 @f3isotope with your "new math" it's a virtual certainty!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-08 23:11:12	@gump_F3 @Gamma_F3 running late.  Waiting for @col_mustard_F3 to get his act together
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-11 00:26:35	@gump_F3 I'll be at the board mtg and workout if that's what you mean... I'll cover for highlands
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-15 11:56:15	@F3Gulfstream aye!  As a reminder, tomorrow is @phatnode aka #bunny's 31st birthday
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-15 12:07:42	@gump_F3 @F3Gulfstream @phatnode fact.  Not EVERY exercise... Just the worst ones
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-13 23:25:33	@Gamma_F3 you going to be at #highlands tomorrow?  I have your shirts from Drive-Thru
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-17 09:11:27	@Gamma_F3 @gump_F3 stand by.  @col_mustard_F3 and I are on the way... Aye!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-13 11:54:56	9 @F3Highlands for a @gump_F3 #purecadence Mettle beatdown
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-13 13:59:16	Let's represent @f3highlands “@springfield_f3: @F3Nation @F3Isotope Mark those calendars http://t.co/oJK7QO9u2g #CSAUP #EPIC”
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-14 23:29:31	@Gamma_F3 I will be indefatigable in my pursuit of a great IEP for @gump_F3
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-14 23:32:58	@gump_F3 @Gamma_F3 aye!  Then I'll focus on #purecadence
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-14 23:55:55	@gump_F3 @Gamma_F3 as I recall, I was on for today until you bogarted it on behalf of Stoli.  Who has Thursday?
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-15 00:14:27	@wild_banshee I ATE THE BONES!!!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-15 00:45:53	@col_mustard_F3 @Gamma_F3 @gump_F3 then I've got next Thursday.  Is Macbeth on for this Thursday?
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-18 20:26:02	@gump_F3 @F3_BootStrap once the boys wake up, we'll be over for a bit
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-18 23:56:33	@ghabbershon that's a fact Jack!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-23 12:18:21	@Snare_F3 @timwilliams_slo thanks Snare!  Really enjoyed it.  Thanks for coming Tim. You're welcome anytime!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-21 01:26:08	@col_mustard_F3 @gump_F3 @Gamma_F3 I'm not happy about how I feel.  #suckfest

250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-24 00:15:13	@gump_F3 @F3_BootStrap where is tomorrow's AO?
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-24 00:22:11	@gump_F3 @F3_BootStrap see you there
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-24 14:26:06	@F3Highlands I just signed up for the USMC Mud Run. Bought for a team... Don't even have a full team yet. No excuses! http://t.co/B18JFkUh03

250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-05-30 01:41:44	@MiniMe_F3 @Friday_F3 @freeedomjw @F3Isotope @EntourageF3 @Cnote_F3 @col_mustard_F3 Gulfstream is first time as well #Highlandsrepresent
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-03 02:02:27	50% chance of rain at 5AM = 100% chance of my attendance @F3Highlands mettle in the gloom.  Get some, aye!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-03 12:09:44	@gump_F3 excuse will be taken into consideration.  Under review...
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-03 13:41:43	@gump_F3 highly likely
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-09 13:47:30	@gump_F3 Andrew Birch, Gump, 46.  Happy birthday, aye!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-15 10:39:29	Hey @F3Highlands... I've got two boys that are pumped for #F3Dads.  Let's hope they are this excited 20 min in!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-11 12:35:03	@gump_F3 @TheNanny_F3 25 highlanders
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-16 18:05:38	@mattmartella @trwhitmire_OBT great work men!  Impressive work.  Way to represent @F3Nation
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-17 21:01:46	@gump_F3 @DreddCNC Gump, you realize Cincinnati and Cleveland are 5 hrs away from each other, right?  And are we talking about OH? #map
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-21 16:39:23	@Snare_F3 dangit.  Knew I was forgetting someone.  Sorry Snare!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-27 20:36:12	@go2hellcarolina you still know my login right?
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-28 23:53:58	@gump_F3 @TheNanny_F3 I couldn't be more excited.  #mud #overflowingcreeks
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-28 23:54:59	@springfield_f3 @F3Nation you better believe it!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-29 00:45:04	Hey @F3Isotope @F3Highlands I think a wet Bear is an angry Bear.  I guess we'll find out tomorrow.  Gotta show to know #TheBear
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-29 22:45:16	Just finished digging up the area for our patio... 3.5 hrs for #TheBear and 5.5 hrs digging.  #fullday #exhausted #nightnight
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-29 22:56:26	@gump_F3 Might be both but stupid is what it seems like now
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-29 23:00:53	@gump_F3 but I won't quit... I won't slow... 'cause I want more!  By Young the Giant
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-30 11:00:49	@Friday_F3 just putting in a brick paver patio.  First time doing it, so it should be interesting
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-30 11:58:56	@Friday_F3 haha.  Might pick your brain if I get stuck
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-07-02 18:35:05	@Cnote_F3 it was fitting that you were my 100th follower!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-07-03 12:22:05	@col_mustard_F3 @F3Isotope steroid shot should clear it up relatively quickly.  See if they will go that route
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-07-04 13:06:32	@Snare_F3 roger that.
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-07-04 13:13:25	@trwhitmire_OBT love it OBT! Can't wait to #embracethesuck with you and all my other F3 brothers
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-07-04 20:27:19	@gump_F3 it was another day working on the patio for me.  #exhausted
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-07-05 02:23:53	@gump_F3 when it's finally complete, we will definitely do that
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-06-30 23:02:02	@gump_F3 enjoy it my friend.  Hope it's relaxing!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-07-01 22:45:10	@drivethru_f3 @F3Isotope everywhere.  And spreading...
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-07-08 11:05:33	@F3Highlands @gump_F3 may have been predictable but still was brutal!  Thanks brother
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-07-10 11:40:53	@BradCorl amen brother!  Hope all is well with you and the fam
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-07-11 01:19:48	@wild_banshee how many wins are you predicting for my beloved Browns?
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-07-11 01:20:55	@wild_banshee I also have an adult beverage in front of me.  I can handle it!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-07-11 01:28:59	@wild_banshee I'm alive.  I think that's "possible" but I'm so used to losing I think I'd be satisfied with 7-9 or 8-8
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-07-11 01:30:03	@wild_banshee I think they could surprise.  Can't underestimate how awful their coaching and scheme were last year
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-07-11 01:31:01	@wild_banshee well, I like it.  Look forward to seeing the rest!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-07-15 22:02:53	@wild_banshee co-sign, but I'll be watching American Ninja Warrior

250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-10-13 18:23:57	@TheNickFoy burned.  At least I was at the draft #derickbyrum.  #enteringdraftroom #leavingdraftroom

250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-10-31 23:51:18	These boys got after it tonight.  They were serious about treats and did WORK! Happy Halloween everyone! http://t.co/leb9ppXL7G
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-11-03 13:21:09	Additionally @Chowder_F3 went solo but met us for the launch.  Impressive brother!
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-11-03 17:58:43	@gump_F3 @Chowder_F3 never saw him after the first mile.  Guessing he did his 10-11 faster than us?  His car was missing when we got back
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-11-03 18:02:13	@GnarlyGoat agreed! It's incredible.
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-11-03 18:04:02	@mattmartella @GnarlyGoat amen brothers!  In progress right now...

250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-11-02 23:12:18	Hey @F3Highlands @F3Isotope, if you want 11 miles at 9 min pace, join us at Highland Creek Elementary for an 0600 launch
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-11-04 15:41:13	@gump_F3 hope not.  Still balky this am.  Need to decide if I should test it tomorrow or hold off for the cruise (I'm Q) on Wed.
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-11-04 17:19:01	@F3_Hootie @gump_F3 ouch.  Sorry to hear that brother.  My self-diagnosis is an IT band inflammation
250941070	thejeffpyles	2013-11-04 17:37:34	@F3_Hootie @gump_F3 @Escalade_F3 will look into it, thanks.

250941070	thejeffpyles	2014-03-03 01:07:23	@Cnote_F3 @gump_F3 Gump is just sour about GORUCK in general. Hates that he didn't come up with the idea.  Just need to ignore him on this

250941070	thejeffpyles	2014-03-03 01:47:12	@gump_F3 @CharlotteHokies @Cnote_F3 is this banter really worth it any longer?
