251681613	F1andNascarFan	2014-08-12 19:24:43	@AlisonCorker rightly said! People need to be better educated about suicide.
251681613	F1andNascarFan	2014-08-12 19:35:11	If you want to help stop suicide, then attend a Safe Talk course. It will open your eyes and may help save a life.
251681613	F1andNascarFan	2014-08-12 19:47:38	@SennaLoveAlways Yeh I understand, in safe talk you try to look for a hook that could possibly lead them to ask for help.
251681613	F1andNascarFan	2014-08-12 19:48:50	@SennaLoveAlways In all honesty you will never stop someone who has fully set their mind on it, unfortunately.
251681613	F1andNascarFan	2014-08-12 20:43:39	If you want to understand suicide, wish to help help prevent it or are having thoughts about it visit this site https://t.co/VTayfJpGWI

251681613	F1andNascarFan	2015-03-25 20:21:09	@JetAgeMuseum @VulcanXM569 so what does Leeming have as a gate guard now? Last saw her in 2005 when I left Leeming
251681613	F1andNascarFan	2015-03-25 20:23:43	@AvroVulcan617 Early or late, thinking about it there was one outside the museum, but wasn't in use by us then.
251681613	F1andNascarFan	2015-03-25 20:25:34	@dava68rich thanks just said to @AvroVulcan617 there was one outside museum when I got there but we never touched her. Can't remember serial
251681613	F1andNascarFan	2015-03-25 20:29:32	@AvroVulcan617 @dava68rich If I remember right she was airfield side of the museum hangers at the top, the Victor was parked close by

251681613	F1andNascarFan	2015-03-25 20:41:27	@AvroVulcan617 @dava68rich It was parked outside no restrictions on access so he took opportunity to show me. Had previously worked on B1s.
251681613	F1andNascarFan	2015-03-25 20:43:46	@AvroVulcan617 @dava68rich would have been between 87 and 92 I think
251681613	F1andNascarFan	2015-03-26 06:21:00	@AvroVulcan617 @dava68rich sudden thought late last night. seem to remember aircraft had been sold, new owner had to remove pt1

251681613	F1andNascarFan	2015-06-13 23:36:46	@MartinHaven do the drivers wear HANS devices? Can't say I've noticed. But that @PatronESM impact was hard

251681613	F1andNascarFan	2015-06-14 07:14:14	@Aeroplaneicons interesting, I guess the USA government would have to approve that first. Could be a while, but would be a great sight.
251681613	F1andNascarFan	2015-06-14 07:20:35	@Aeroplaneicons know guys at Brunty have had to ask for permission even to apply electrical power to there F4 because of USA regs.
251681613	F1andNascarFan	2015-06-14 07:28:41	@Aeroplaneicons no matter what, if someone gets a F4 running, what an awesome sight and sound it will be
