2523690391	JonaiEileen	2015-05-20 18:48:38	Sadly my demands that @jillianhello refrain from heating up delicious food on days that I bring salad for lunch are #NullAndVoid

2523690391	JonaiEileen	2015-06-01 22:08:01	The majority of my tweets are about @jillianhello food choices and I feel that each one is completely necessary to share with cyber space
2523690391	JonaiEileen	2015-06-01 22:09:24	Especially when @jillianhello tells me she spends her weekends thinking about where to find a great salad #LocalSaladFaire #OldTowneOrange
