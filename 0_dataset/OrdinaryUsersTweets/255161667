255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-22 03:52:18	@JimNorton  Tonight it was announced that Bob Backlund will be inducted into the WWE hall of fame this year.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-22 04:26:08	@bobonyc105 Sure you do.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-22 12:15:33	@AnthonyCumia No, he is gonna start asking for prop rods to hold his big head upright.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-25 20:46:10	@MelissaStetten so you are saying that it is the most awesome?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-26 01:38:29	@bobonyc105 @anthonycumia Hear that, Ant? YOU gotta make it possible.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-26 02:04:10	@TedsOnAEmporium Thanks man. Is this version of R&amp;F clean? I grabbed a copy earlier from someone and it was shite.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-27 01:28:52	@TedsOnAEmporium What is your criteria for "disposable addresses"?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-27 01:29:30	@bobonyc105 On Twitter? You are a true genius.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-27 01:31:02	@OpieRadio So glad I'm out eating and watching this. It will definitely make the bill lower.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-27 23:48:42	@PatFrmMoonachie Relax big fella, cans have an easy flip opening, no need to tear it apart.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 01:40:34	@iLikeGirlsDaily Congrats mate!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 01:43:13	@JoeandEvan My money's on Ryback. Had a title match vs Punk cancelled due to Punks bad knee. I think he gets the push.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 01:44:08	@MikeFrancesaNY Mike could nevah strut like that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 01:46:42	@erockradio Even my 8 year old son asked, why is he even on?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 02:06:23	@erockradio Absolutely perfect.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 02:18:53	@erockradio And now Golddust!!!!! This #royalrumble is far better than last year already!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 03:03:19	@erockradio Not yet. That's gonna happen in the next match.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 03:14:28	@sethgutt The Shield gonna have any part in this next match? Haven't heard from them yet tonight. Would b worse than Cena winning.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 03:15:05	@erockradio Nah. The Shield is gonna ruin it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 03:27:19	@sethgutt Me too, but I want this match to be finished clean.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 03:32:00	@sethgutt I got a feeling the Shield will interfere, making Punk lose title to Rock. I'd actually like to see Rock win, but not like that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 03:48:28	@sethgutt That match was EXCELLENT!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-30 16:48:42	@TedsOnAEmporium By now you should know that most people (myself included) are dopes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-30 17:50:08	@yamahajesse I'm sorry, but I have been a member for less than 30 days. The site won't generate an invite cod for me yet.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-30 17:58:32	@yamahajesse Without a doubt.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 12:30:17	@sternshow @howardstern Like his pretentious speech the last day on Krock?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 12:39:04	@sternshow Why? So they can look like a starving pelican just like him?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 15:59:54	@TedsOnAEmporium I'm getting g a Forbidden notice when I go to the site this morning. Yes, I'm registered and all that fancy stuff.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 16:09:35	@TedsOnAEmporium Ok. Got it. Thanks Ted, you do a great job.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 17:48:48	@RhymesWithPen I honestly thought that last night's pay per view was excellent.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-28 17:49:26	@RhymesWithPen it got me super mad and then with 10 minutes left, they blew the doors off of it. Job well done
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-01-31 12:09:21	@JimNorton I didn't think there was any inside artwork for Sabotage. R u talkin about a gatefold album or the paper sleeve?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-02 15:47:00	@KatieCorless Lol, how clever.....
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-03 00:36:13	@bobonyc105 Don't tell me what I need.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-01 02:05:30	@AnthonyCumia Jesus, I didn't notice the guy standing next to the box. Congrats! Is it getting mounted tonight?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-01 19:57:12	@JoseCanseco no 1 said he didn't, the fact is yours are just bigger.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-03 02:39:17	@OpieRadio @kendalbeasley No shit???
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-03 02:41:54	@OpieRadio Been looking also. Nothing yet....
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-01 19:53:19	@JoseCanseco yes, you most certainly do.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-01 22:03:47	@OpieRadio Central Jersey sunset while driving. http://t.co/7qgWJBjS
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-03 23:20:50	@OpieRadio You're right, Jennifer Hudson is quite attractive. #hubbahubba
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-05 02:09:16	@CMPunk Works as good as Ticketmaster did when the Axxess VIP tickets went on presale.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-08 21:42:58	@AnthonyCumia hey, that's not a snowball. #dunderhead
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-11 01:27:24	@AnthonyCumia @Krommsan If you didn't already know, Anthony is a fancy-man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-11 20:25:31	@NekoCase They do, but only after they're 35.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-13 15:18:14	@erockradio That's why you gay!!! That's why you gay!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-14 12:01:58	@Jay_HorwitzPR Who chose those hats? Looks worse than a little league cap. And I actually like Mr. Met.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-12 03:46:54	@sethgutt So I'm guessing, based on time, that we won't be seeing anything from 'taker tonight.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-15 19:11:11	@bobonyc105 You always say that, huh?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-16 14:41:30	@JoeandEvan MLB please.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-12 03:40:01	@AnthonyCumia At least its not a "goatse" pic.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-10 00:41:17	@Alsboringtweets That's just a waste of money. Might as well eat an odor eater shoe insert.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-10 00:42:22	@Alsboringtweets Lemme guess, the snow ruined all the plans you would have had tonight, right?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-19 11:56:23	@sternshow Way to be timely about things.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-14 03:06:16	@PatFuckinDuffy In drive through the other day, lady asks if I want to try them. Answer was, "Jesus, no. That's gross." She chuckled.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-21 00:24:54	@erockradio Is that a short sleeved suit jacket? Awesome find, E!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-10 22:01:30	@JimNorton Did you win?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-20 01:59:50	@ChrisCarlinSNY Looks like lawn furniture from the future.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-17 22:56:25	@AnthonyCumia Looks like a luck dragon from The Never Ending Story.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-22 01:26:56	@PatFrmMoonachie Pat, need an expert opinion. Why is one dog a diff. color? Safe? http://t.co/5Dwp342oQt
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-18 01:10:53	@notsam You set the figures up to match the matches? #yeahimwatchingtoo #myfuckinhero
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-18 01:13:14	@AnthonyCumia Hope there's no icy patches tonight. Be careful with that thing, you could die. #oldladygivesacare
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-26 02:06:17	@sethgutt No one cares. Soooo lame.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-26 02:07:20	@TripleH Hell of a return.
#ImSoBadBabyIDontCare
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-26 02:10:49	@sethgutt If only there was a way Zeb could wrestle. Then no need for Swagger. He is weakest link of this whole gimmick/feud.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-26 02:12:12	@sethgutt Pretty close. No real need for Swagger though. He's useless with  mic.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-26 04:03:06	@sethgutt So far, this match has definitely been the highlight of tonight.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-27 02:47:03	@PatFrmMoonachie Is that the one on the parkway northbound near exit 135?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-27 02:57:30	@japarsell Is not.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-27 03:05:47	@OpieRadio Not trying to be douchey, but have ya ever thought of switching allegiances?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-28 00:09:29	@notsam Virgil on Queens bound subway. Just posted. http://t.co/jdnXw5QvCW
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-02-28 15:06:16	@PatFrmMoonachie That, my friend is the car of the guy who will save us from the zombie apocalypse.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-05 03:03:24	@WWEFandango Your name is "Too Scared To Wrestle"
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-05 04:11:17	@WWEFandango That's ok. We don't want or need to know.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-01 02:50:44	@AnthonyCumia What's a fancy man like you doing with pocket change on the counter? Like so many nickels and dimes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-01 03:39:05	@bobonyc105 You are a vile creature.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-03 20:33:26	@erockradio Check out the worst dives and cheaters. http://t.co/sugtlRJjWn
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-02 23:32:33	@BShopWindow Screw that, Saturdays are for fat joints. The vape is for work nights.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-03 23:25:52	@TedsOnAEmporium That's great, I was just wondering that. Thanks, Ted!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-05 00:26:25	@OpieRadio Wearing dumb Halloween coshtoomes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-09 18:37:07	@joederosacomedy My consistent opinion is that they are both douchebags.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-05 01:45:10	@erockradio Nah, my 8 year old and I met him at a @ProWresSynd  show in Jersey. We're both super psyched. Very nice guy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-05 02:53:01	@sethgutt This Fandango thing sucks.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-05 02:59:20	@sethgutt Pretty much, but he seems like a character that won't last no matter what, so why waste the time in the first place?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-12 23:56:02	@JCLayfield Keep it up JBL! Agree 100% with your thoughts, whether in jest or not.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-10 23:08:12	@AnthonyCumia You keep the clip in your pocket or does your holster have an extra compartment?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-15 13:58:05	@notsam This is all your doing and people should know!!! 
http://t.co/DRg5Lo8YXU
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-15 14:10:38	@TedsOnAEmporium just reading the related tweets is making me very excited to hear the show.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-17 14:11:27	@Alsboringtweets "It might be a crack head, who got a hold of the wrong stuff!"
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-17 17:14:23	@bobonyc105 @eastsidedave Because bobo, you don't ever shut the fuck up. Give it a rest once in a while for Christ's sake.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-21 18:55:42	@TedsOnAEmporium Maybe you should start tagging your tweets with pictures of titties.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-21 18:57:07	@TedsOnAEmporium 3 clicks, and the show is downloading for me. Could not be much easier.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-19 01:32:27	@erockradio Are you guys planning on a good amount of wrestlers in during #wrestlemania week? Please say yes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-19 23:54:34	@notsam A star is born.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-20 00:46:57	@PatFrmMoonachie Is the cord long enough to sit back or are ya 4 inches from the TV? #youreyeswillshrivel
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-20 01:21:59	@PatFrmMoonachie What ya watching? Netflix or sumtin else?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-26 14:14:12	@RacistFrancesa @notsam I would. In a heartbeat.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-26 14:42:51	@PatFrmMoonachie don't tell me that you had to drive from Cherry Hill to Rahway today.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-29 14:29:19	@jdharm Can you translate that into English please?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-03-27 10:58:37	@AdamJones_tv Will you be trekking east to #wrestlemania this year?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-02 00:53:22	@erockradio Looks like she shoved the vibrator in the wrong hole. #hornyslut
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-02 20:17:55	@AskWrestlemania What is the cost of parking this weekend during Axxess?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-05 20:23:34	@sethgutt My son and I met Vader last night. He couldn't have been nicer. have a great time.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-04 15:53:06	@notsam Are you guys gonna be broadcasting from Jersey tomorrow?
#wrestlemania
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-05 22:05:25	@notsam The way it should be.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-03 16:15:51	@sternshow What about the hundreds of racist remarks made by Howard over the years? Gonna cover that?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-04 18:01:05	@TripleH You really like those panoramic shots, huh? They look great btw.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-04 18:29:15	@EastSideDave how did you get all of those mid 90's tattoo designs around your head?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-04 23:44:46	Just got to meet the great @notsam at pro wrestling syndicate in Metuchen. Couldn't have been a nicer chap.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-05 13:21:33	@TedsOnAEmporium No offense meant, but you should not be wondering why your numbers are down.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-05 13:25:56	@JoeandEvan were you planning on going to Wrestlemania this weekend?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-05 14:35:12	@bobonyc105 They don't.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-05 15:40:43	@MiKeIsMiA @TedsOnAEmporium Not ungrateful at all. Was more of a joke than a serious statement.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-07 21:30:17	@sethgutt Just got to our seats!!! Section 117 and man, what a view!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-07 21:30:56	@notsam You here yet? Stage looks beautiful!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-09 01:26:15	@erockradio Not sure, but the crowd tonight sure let McMahon know what they wanted. #rawaftermaniaisalwaysgood
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-09 01:44:16	@OpieRadio @notsam @erockradio the clip of @JimNorton and Fandango made it onto a clip of #wweraw tonight.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-13 22:10:11	@notsam I met ya last week in Metuchen. Are there DVDs available to hear your golden pipes?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-14 01:17:42	@TheIBang I do, but they are green, fluffy and in a zip lock bag at the moment.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-12 14:45:08	@kriztufer Spiral out....keep going.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-15 21:48:43	@JimNorton Stop saying the word God as if it actually exists. You know better than that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-16 01:10:24	@sethgutt But this time it'll be in a cage. #totalsarcasm
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-16 01:11:46	@bobonyc105 @opieradio This guy is unreal.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-16 01:14:17	@sethgutt They had to do something with him. Us, Cesaro was getting g buried.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-16 01:17:32	@sethgutt As soon as I saw that, I said to myself that something will prevent it from actually happening.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-16 01:19:12	@sethgutt  But now I see they're in London, I take back all of it. Should b a good match.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-16 01:36:44	@sethgutt Or do you think they'd strip it from Cesaro to team him with Kassius Ohno and giving them a shot at team HellNo?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-16 01:37:32	@sethgutt Why do you think it was pretaped? The crowd wouldn't stand for that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-16 01:42:31	@sethgutt I thought they would've had them start a feud when Ohno's called up. If they want to solidify the TT div, it would b a great move.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-16 01:43:45	@sethgutt He is, but I don't see that style translating well at live events. He's best suited for backstage promos.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-16 01:52:06	@sethgutt Poor Kahli can barely even walk any more.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-16 03:12:52	@WWEFandango You sure as hell did.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-16 21:13:08	@trailerparkkid @notsam @CMPunk You should be embarrassed that you don't know the difference between than and then.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-17 00:04:01	@bobonyc105 @anthonycumia Does this have to do with the movie @erockradio is writing?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-17 14:03:10	@cc660 @7BOOMERESIASON boomers CBSsports minute I said that Pat Summerall was 22 when he died.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-19 14:07:05	@RacistFrancesa @FranksYanks23 because this douche wants to tell people how to think.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-19 23:00:01	@PatFuckinDuffy Rock and fuckin roll!! Good luck man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-19 14:33:37	@FranksYanks23 This retard thinks he is going to get the hard news from an account labeled @RacistFrancesa ? #blitheringfaggot
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-20 01:36:57	@trillteen You go, girl. Or guy. Or both. ;)
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-19 19:12:14	@AnthonyCumia A dead hooker?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-20 16:23:22	@notsam Is that a Murder By Death shirt on the right?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-20 16:45:18	@bobonyc105 @opieradio @anthonycumia @jimnorton Have you ever thought about shutting the fuck up?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-20 00:26:11	@OpieRadio I knew he was a Mo.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-20 01:27:20	@trillteen Hope you and your family die in a fire.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-22 23:23:40	@RacistFrancesa Thought your new av looked like crap until I enlarged the pic. Home run, ok? You hit the tre, ok?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-23 05:43:30	@iphonebasedgod Of course it is me. It has always been me.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-19 15:56:36	@JoeandEvan So far today, 2 complete dopes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-19 16:27:44	@OpieRadio is there a link to this, Op?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-19 17:26:12	@SJFrank wasn't that listed as one of the most popular baby names in 2012?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-19 20:25:37	@AnthonyCumia Jesus! I want one!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-19 21:49:03	@PatFuckinDuffy Good for you, Pat. Do you have something else lined up?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-21 23:51:26	@TedsOnAEmporium Any ETA on Sam Roberts show from today?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-23 21:43:21	@travistefft hope you had a good time. Did you guys go on the Star Wars ride at Disney Studios?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-24 00:39:07	@RacistFrancesa He could be holding eggplant cock in his hand, don't matter. That look on his mug is what makes it, plus the coke bottle.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-24 00:44:05	@RacistFrancesa Try and 'shop a cock in his hand. Nevermind, just realized how gay I sound.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-24 02:04:50	@OpieRadio Jesus, Op. You been drinking tonight?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-24 15:37:27	@TMZ Because she doesn't eat like an elephant and exercises.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-26 22:17:05	@notsam Did you see this today? Utter nonsense. Shame, the venue is great. http://t.co/UGRredt3ca
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-25 22:14:24	@TedsOnAEmporium Did you end up getting a new radio?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-27 16:25:04	@AnthonyCumia In other words, they most likely lied their asses off.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-27 16:31:36	@JimNorton Have you seen this live version of Is God Dead? Fucking awesome. http://t.co/Emmaxt6kji

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-29 02:24:08	This little guy came home with us today. http://t.co/2e9I4r8Sia
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-29 02:35:03	@kriztufer Thanks mang, little pup is tuckered out. Finally asleep.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-29 02:35:53	@RacistFrancesa Totally stoked. Haven't had a puppy in ages.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-30 02:11:32	@RacistFrancesa Exactly. My 8 year old asked why he wasn't getting booed and I was sobbing too much to answer. Solid guy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-29 10:53:27	@sternshow @Siriusjay A few years too late, no?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-29 17:26:35	@RacistFrancesa Drive thru: "thanks for choosing McDonalds" Me: "I'm good, how r u?" #FuckingIdiot #HappensOverAndOver

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-26 15:59:39	@PWMania Son and I noticed a lot of cops when we left Supercard night 1. Left after the 2nd match. Is PWS still trying to figure it out?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-26 18:03:55	@RacistFrancesa That is because @HowardStern  and @robertAbooey are insecure assholes. @OpieRadio @AnthonyCumia
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-04-27 16:25:55	@AnthonyCumia @tkkfan420 Especially if the other doctor said the baby was fine to be home and in no danger whatsoever.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-02 19:21:07	@notsam Overall, what did you think of it?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-02 20:00:35	@FeinsandNYDN The one guy who I don't want to come off the DL. Great.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-03 01:10:44	@OpieRadio Its ok, Op. Happens to everyone. Still, a funny article regardless.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-03 02:54:47	@sethgutt Damn good game!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-03 02:55:12	@JoeandEvan Pretty awesome game.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-04 01:44:40	@sethgutt The Knicks should be embarrassed. They are shitting the bed!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-04 01:45:26	@RacistFrancesa Knocks are playing like garbage.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-04 01:46:20	@RacistFrancesa Damn auto correct
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-04 02:33:47	@sethgutt Exactly. However, it didn't look good for a second there.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-04 18:25:38	@PatFrmMoonachie Ever been there? They have one in Woodbridge. They have a spicy, deep fried burger that's killer.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-07 02:16:36	@sethgutt Do you really think that was his office? Kinda small, no?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-09 01:31:27	@YankeesWFAN Why is Garder wearing a mitten? Is that new?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-10 23:16:37	@erockradio Is it just me or does the spire lookout of place on that building?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-11 00:01:15	@notsam Maybe, but you do sound extra sultry.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-11 01:44:46	@MykeeT Agreed. Just doesn't seem to fit well.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-13 17:48:54	@notsam Go to taco bell. They have plenty.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-13 18:28:56	@AnthonyCumia 2 things: 1-Is there such a thing as a nice black neighborhood? 2-how many of the suspects had priors?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-14 00:13:49	@RhymesWithPen What bar? The Regal Beagle?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-17 12:14:25	@OpieRadio What does the note say?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-20 03:30:51	@RacistFrancesa Agreed, but tomorrow morning there is gonna be an 8 year old that's gonna b mighty pissed that Lesnar won.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-22 21:35:37	@AnthonyCumia @NAACP why can't they just behave?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-24 01:31:39	@bobonycxm103 @anthonycumia Yeah Ant, he DECEIVES A PIECE OF THE ACTION.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-24 17:39:42	@AnthonyCumia Sad thing is, when he gets acquitted, people are gonna go ape shit. See what I did there? Ding ding ding...
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-27 12:59:42	@NekoCase For a second, I thought that was a one handed man in a parade.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-24 22:25:41	@AnthonyCumia @Cdmjr2 Did GZ punch himself in the face and slam his own head against the sidewalk?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-24 22:43:54	@Cdmjr2 @AnthonyCumia Go fuck your mother, you droopy eyed faggot.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-30 12:12:17	@jdharm People know, they just don't care anymore.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-29 12:08:29	@Ernie1138 Wow, another clueless fool. Surprise, surprise.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-05-29 12:11:00	@Ernie1138 Shouldn't you be in a kitchen washing dishes or mowing a lawn somewhere?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-01 22:30:56	@AnthonyCumia Any progress with the pool?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-03 20:32:55	@AnthonyCumia Looks like Taylor Swift in 15-20 years.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-11 15:43:58	@kclarkusa Provide a link. Sorry, but you're wrong. And who says "duh" anymore?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-11 15:49:50	@kclarkusa I said provide a link from court documents where it said his nose wasn't broken.He needed the bone to be set that night.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-11 15:51:59	@kclarkusa I looked at your pic. Picture on the left shows a crooked nose. The right one was taken AFTER THE HOSPITAL SET THE BROKEN BONE.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-11 15:55:55	@kclarkusa You keep holding on to that premise. That's why they have a trial. When the medical report is shown in court, what will you say?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-11 15:56:52	@kclarkusa Really? Not lying, you just refuse to listen and look at actual facts.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-11 16:01:55	@AnthonyCumia This fool has been sending me the same dumb pic over and over showing how GZ only had a little cut on his nose.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-13 21:21:01	@ATLeut Thanks man.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-11 16:23:03	@kclarkusa Deal. As long as when he is acquitted, you promise to behave.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-11 16:43:37	@kclarkusa Sorry, you got the wrong guy. I'm not that emotionally invested in the outcome. The jury has the final say.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-22 17:18:59	@Alsboringtweets As long as you didn't get a boner when you read it......
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-22 21:52:48	@JimNorton Wow, you really were a Chubsy Ubsy. #keepitup
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-24 01:46:44	@BShopWindow Sshhh, some but is walking a tightrope and praising Jesus a whole bunch.... #kindacreepy
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-23 12:53:15	@OttoAndGeorge Cool those fuckers down. Room temp blueberries suck dick.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-23 16:18:13	@OpieRadio AAAAIIIIIIDDDDSSSS!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-23 16:41:05	@travistefft Is your dog wearing a car restraint? Was thinking about one for our Boston Terrier.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-24 12:23:38	@cc660 Why is Mike holding a bunch of Chicklets in his mouth?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-24 12:30:26	@travistefft @vulture as if there were not any other school shootings prior to that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-25 19:36:15	@SternFBSuperfan @KathyGriffin @HowardStern Look ma, 2 old yentas.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-27 03:22:34	@NY_Cinderella @AnthonyCumia Exactly why they didn't pursue charges until AFTER the public outcry.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-28 16:16:07	@uthebombdotcom Maybe, just maybe that's because he is. Exactly why he was not initially arrested.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-27 23:14:56	@billglass6 @notsam I agree with this statement.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-27 23:17:45	@AnthonyCumia @uptownclassy This statement coming from someone with classy in their username. Surprised? #keepitclassyhoodrat
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-28 22:06:35	@aricjones What a great idea. Way to further the stereotype. #sadandignorant
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-29 17:19:22	@JimNorton @MikeBloomberg She really got this one right, didn't she?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-28 23:54:03	@AnthonyCumia You read what  Bloomberg said today?  She makes some sense. Finally, someone in power had the balls. http://t.co/1jAVq7r8yT
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-29 20:49:18	@REALBROTHER0003  Not "you" as a group, but the lady who testified and the prosecutor who thought she'd make a good witness. #bothdumb
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-29 20:51:10	@getoffmeburth Exactly. Both are goddamn idiots.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-29 20:57:13	@REALBROTHER0003 Ok, you keep believing that. Its completely your choice. But you'll be mighty upset at the verdict.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-29 20:58:42	@getoffmeburth 1-Took off shoes and put on sneakers.2-Took of sneakers and put on shoes. Always the same ones. #myfeetfuckingstink
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-29 21:22:43	@getoffmeburth This is all you need, my friend. http://t.co/8egI89FTXR
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-29 21:34:12	@REALBROTHER0003 @LisaBloom Where is this so called evidence? In fantasy land, that's where.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-29 21:44:17	@REALBROTHER0003 @lisabloom No one testifies seeing GZ on top. Quite the opposite actually.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-29 21:48:00	@REALBROTHER0003 @LisaBloom So all of a sudden, a timeline can tell who said what? I'm sorry you're so angry. You should lighten up.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-29 22:09:45	@ChuckSD @REALBROTHER0003 Of course he does. Apparently, you can only be racist if you are white. Or Mexican. Or both.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-29 22:13:32	@ChuckSD @REALBROTHER0003 @LisaBloom @TheReidReport Always plenty of them.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-29 23:47:50	@REALBROTHER0003 @ChuckSD Ok, keep thinking that. Just don't condone or promote the rioting when he is acquitted. KTHNXBY
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-30 00:03:12	@REALBROTHER0003 @ChuckSD  I'm sure you'll come up with some type of excuse for savage behavior when GZ is allowed to walk.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-30 01:59:50	@REALBROTHER0003 @ChuckSD @REM63489 @bootyisyou He used it DURING, you fool.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-30 02:06:10	@REALBROTHER0003 @ChuckSD @REM63489 @bootyisyou No one (racist or not) is saying that because the diff is the rest are all guilty. Zim isn't
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-30 02:06:27	@FealtyToNoOne @REALBROTHER0003 @ChuckSD @REM63489 @bootyisyou Exactly.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-30 02:29:32	@REALBROTHER0003 @ChuckSD @REM63489 @bootyisyou You are the one coming off as a racist fool.#cantaccepttruth

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-06-30 05:58:01	@running_on_E @IndyEnigma That's a pretty bold assumption. #recklessasshole
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-07 13:06:36	@OpieRadio Osteen is bad but Jack Van Impe is the worst.  In a hotel in NC on way down to Myrtle Beach. My 8 year old loves Friends.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-01 14:12:32	@notsam When will your Sunday show be up for On Demand? #needstolisten
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-01 20:12:40	@joederosacomedy Love his work. Do you have a full picture of it that we could see?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-02 01:28:35	@AllHailC To call you a piece of shit would be a massive understatement.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-02 01:38:19	@sethgutt Agreed. Only juice was hoping RVD would come out earlier with all other MITB contestants. #underthedomeisonin20mins
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-08 19:09:01	@RealGilbert Then you should apologize to mimes everywhere.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-08 23:27:55	@JennyJohnsonHi5 Speak for yourself. Hubba hubba....
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-09 18:18:36	@erockradio Magnets? How the fuck do they work? Its fucking magic, Owww!!!!!!
#DiceCP
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-11 12:59:10	@sternshow No one cares.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-10 17:00:26	@WFAN660 Then again, he's a very dimwitted racist.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-10 17:03:40	@JimNorton You're statement has been the answer. "His reps". Fuck those assholes in their assholes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-14 04:52:42	@Lunatic43 @ArtieQuitter And yet you follow him. Maybe you're sniffin' too much lighter fluid.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-14 04:55:36	@THENYGENERAL @AnthonyCumia Would love to see how they'd act if they were actually called colored people these days.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-14 04:57:30	@notsam Who is your choice to replace Kane at #MITB tomorrow night?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-12 04:01:34	@erockradio wtf is that? Someone trying to burgle you?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-13 20:45:28	@JimNorton @CNN Maybe they're coming to their senses about this being a "white guy". http://t.co/TYEyIgpE5e
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-13 20:57:13	@Jadebernard1 @THENYGENERAL @anthonycumia Why, are you an intimidating "tough guy"? Ooohhh. He should be scared.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-13 21:59:26	@AnthonyCumia @NYtommy427 Because the guy wearing it is black.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-14 15:38:07	@AnthonyCumia It was always about race. It was ONLY about race. Too bad everyone got GZ's race wrong.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-12 23:14:00	@RacistFrancesa @shutyourmouse And don't forget free beer!!! http://t.co/t7g6otEazi

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-18 15:37:31	@FredBrooklyn Jesus, looks like  baby Leatherface. Just needs a chainsaw.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-18 15:38:37	@amyschumer You on with @JimNorton ?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-18 16:21:12	@FredBrooklyn Always makes me want to pour something on them and say, "ok, its workin".
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-18 18:08:55	@PatFuckinDuffy I'm in the 732. Got any offers?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-18 18:10:39	@fredrogers75 @patfuckinduffy And that's upper 732. Edison.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-22 22:50:17	@ThatEricAlper @NekoCase  Thank you. I was getting a bit chilly.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-25 14:06:02	@THENYGENERAL @OpieRadio Apparently, cum.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-26 21:39:33	@PatFuckinDuffy yeah, because they're really hitting the crap out of the ball lately.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-25 22:21:19	@MikeFrancesaNY gotta buy him that shirt.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-26 14:13:35	@NekoCase He is naked with a horse somewhere in the dark.  http://t.co/GSm01CTWNf
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-24 21:15:00	@notsam You're lucky. You just plugged @StacyKeibler . I'm jealous. #godofbroadcasting
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-28 01:38:22	Let's hope this fight is better than the last one. #UFConFOX8
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-28 02:30:00	@THENYGENERAL Never had the pleasure. I got a handheld iolite and love it. How are the bags? Weird or no?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-28 02:43:30	@THENYGENERAL Had this for a few years now. Just packed with some Girl Scout Cookie. 8 beers and after this, I'm set.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-28 02:43:59	@THENYGENERAL Damn, forgot pic. http://t.co/k5wpEiRFZW
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-28 02:50:23	@THENYGENERAL One bag enough for the desired effect?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-28 02:53:20	@THENYGENERAL Have mine for stealth reasons.  Usually bone it up on the road though.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-27 14:42:56	@OpieRadio @Marilynfreak Screw you both. Been stuck on 147 for close to a month now.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-28 01:23:14	@OpieRadio You should have seen how much it would cost to finger-pop the hooker. #ForDaShow
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-29 12:39:00	@DSPOD37 @OpieRadio Of course he does. He gave the guy a twenty.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-29 15:59:03	@AnthonyCumia What was the final tally from the casino this weekend?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-30 03:02:53	@sethgutt @JCLayfield Mountain climbing.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-30 03:12:13	@iLikeGirlsDaily Only if she promised to leave that fivehead at home.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-30 03:01:45	@JoeandEvan Whenever he's cutting a promo, it looks like he's gonna start laughing every single time.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-30 03:10:48	@AnthonyCumia @boboxm103 How long until we hear, "give me my twitter account back!!"
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-07-30 16:14:37	@Bahh_Vinsengarg I noticed it last night. Nice and puffy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-02 23:47:06	@JimNorton Did a slut suck your cock or sumptin? Tsss tsss
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-01 13:14:27	@EastSideDave Noodles agrees. http://t.co/ingvPeiBan
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-01 17:29:39	@BMonzoWFAN Days? Either you don't clean up after yourself or you have magic bacon.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-01 17:56:12	@BMonzoWFAN One of the only meats my son will eat.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-01 19:16:37	@JoeandEvan @RMarietta23 I think he's just being sarcastic.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-03 18:36:17	@hotdamnirock Then stop stealing from him.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-04 06:46:37	@CMPunk Nah, you are. #followCMPunk yeah, my 12 followers will see this. Half of which are fakes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-04 18:25:15	@yaway13 @AnthonyCumia Not just her language, but the CONTENT of her twitter feed before she scrubbed it is proof she is a fucking dope.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-04 19:21:55	@yaway13 Then you, young man are a complete idiot, just like she is.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-05 12:54:03	@DRUDGE_REPORT It wasn't panned. Did you even read the article you linked to? #amateurhour
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-06 01:35:28	@Astaff @notsam Too bad Brock hasn't been around for any of it. That, and the fact he doesn't talk. Should be Hetman vs Punk.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-06 01:36:28	@Astaff @notsam Heyman.
 Damn sausage fingers.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-06 11:22:05	@RacistFrancesa I don't listen til later in the day. Please tell me faggy pants isn't still making an issue about that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-06 11:30:49	@RacistFrancesa I was a big Fez fan until he stopped doing his fucking job. On what planet does a RADIO GUY GET A PASS FOR NOT TALKING??
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-07 12:55:09	@LenBermanSports No he didn't. #headsizedon'tlie

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-07 23:57:20	@ArtieQuitter Don't be a pussy. Do it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-08 02:19:20	@jdharm Everyone knows that it is.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-09 18:07:40	@NekoCase No matter what else you do in life, DO NOT eat green tea flavored chocolate. Hideous.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-12 03:21:12	@Troyquan So sorry to hear about your loss.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-12 18:04:31	@sternshow His hair or his "hair system"?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-12 19:41:18	@CMPunk it's a trap!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-13 01:03:48	@sethgutt I'd rather not have a guest ref this year for the WWE Championship.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-13 16:40:51	@SychoVicious @CMPunk so whenever you hit someone with a chair, were you ripping someone else off? You should get over yourself
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-13 18:25:33	@SychoVicious Why should I? You're the one that's being the attention whore.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-14 15:42:06	@KellyDognut94 Yeah, because its all real, right? Learn how to spell, jackass.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-14 16:11:33	@finditandkillit @erockradio now that does not sound half bad.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-14 23:38:31	@JimNorton Simply brilliant, Jim. Perfect.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-15 14:27:12	@StephMcMahon @DarrenYoungWWE Congrats, now you have to change your twitter bio. ;) Good for you, man. #NoDaysOff
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-14 02:01:46	@sethgutt I'd like that idea, but I want to see DB win and retain it against Orton. Would love to see Sandow become WHC.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-17 17:00:38	@Alsboringtweets I always see foreigners (not the band) using it at ShopRite.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-17 17:06:37	@notsam Are you going to the show tomorrow night or flying home before?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-14 15:46:52	@erockradio That sounds absolutely vile.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-15 01:34:08	@erockradio I still have my Zaxxon board game in my parents attic. Loved the arcade game.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-16 16:39:11	@rickygervais Will there be free hookers in heaven? And what if I don't get there?

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-19 22:16:49	@kingsthings Wrong with a player? Kinda vague, no? Why if a player is a serial adulterer, would that constitute as "wrong"?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-19 00:04:25	@notsam Because she's the luckiest girl in the world.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-19 01:57:25	@CMPunk Awesome. Simply awesome match.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-17 15:43:33	@OpieRadio @katiemarilyn89 The Opster is a good guy. He helped me through a bought of the sniffles once.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-20 23:17:14	@ClassicShelb Stupid? I think you misunderstood me, Shelby. I was saying you would be a degenerate if you did not do that. Get it?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-20 23:38:43	@ClassicShelb Ain't no thang. Love you on R&amp;F.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-21 17:29:42	@OpieRadio Fucker. I've been stuck on 147 going on two fucking months!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-23 00:45:42	@BMonzoWFAN @YankeesWFAN Sadly,  @ABRACCO did neither.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-23 11:37:22	@DRUDGE_REPORT Yet it doesn't shock the rest of the world.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-22 11:49:08	@lastoftheross Too bad they've sucked the last 15 years. Lars' snare sounds like a garbage can and the guitars couldn't be muddier. Yuck.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-22 12:05:47	@AnthonyCumia @mothershuck That break yesterday had me this close to switching you off. Those bitches sucked. What fool would go see that

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-24 22:04:27	@Alsboringtweets Yes, but still more of a sport than golf or bowling.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-31 00:12:05	@THENYGENERAL They have to at the very least, win 2 of 3 this weekend to even have a small chance for the WC.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-31 00:15:49	Fucking Sabathia. Yet again coughs up a lead.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-31 00:34:19	@THENYGENERAL Agreed.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-28 20:58:08	@JennyJohnsonHi5 No, this time its the smell....
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-28 20:58:26	@WWEAJLee No one can.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-28 20:59:54	@THENYGENERAL I guess the clouds went away, huh?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-28 21:37:29	@THENYGENERAL Good deal. I had my head in a drop ceiling all day running wires. Didn't see sun until work was over.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-28 21:39:08	@NPRinskeep Any idea yet on when it'll air?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-28 21:57:31	@THENYGENERAL Wasn't too bad today. There have been times I thought I'd pass out from the heat in attics and crawlspaces though.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-28 22:18:10	@AnthonyCumia Awwww. Very cute, Ant.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-28 22:56:10	@THENYGENERAL Exactly. Nothing like having insulation all over you first thing in the morning and for the rest of the sweaty day.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-30 00:08:31	@THENYGENERAL The thing I don't get is no one is forcing them to work there. If you don't like the pay, don't take the job.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-30 00:09:26	@AnthonyCumia Very reasonable.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-30 00:13:05	@Lux_Suicide My kitty Happy died this weekend. He was 16. Looked very similar. Glad to hear he's doing well.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-08-30 00:14:20	@THENYGENERAL Anytime there is a self serve lane in a store, I use it. Less people to "muss up the works".

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-09-30 00:32:32	@JRsBBQ Gotta start at the beginning.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-09-30 01:55:59	@notsam Nope. Personally, I was hoping he'd be the one to ingest the ricin. Show today was great, Otto rules.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-10-23 12:01:16	@sternshow @howardstern As always, he's full of shit. No one cares, doesn't he get that at this point?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-10-23 16:14:44	@notsam You bastard. Waiting patiently.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-10-21 23:14:46	@notsam @JimNorton Wowza. Were you guys as uncomfortable conducting that interview as I was watching it?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-10-22 00:18:21	Hey, @BeavisCumia what did you think of that train wreck Jenna Jameson on today's after show?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-10-23 21:03:04	@MichelleDBeadle Is that a hemorrhoid seat? You poor woman.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-10-23 21:18:56	@FredBrooklyn Actually, what we are seeing the last few days are Democrats  scrambling to save their own jobs. #worthlesscunts
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-10-23 23:54:24	@FredBrooklyn No, but it's a definite sign you should be living in a hut made of mud. #WipeYourAssWithItInsteadOfUsingYourHand

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-02 05:27:51	@FredBrooklyn Please tell Ant to remove the spinning LFTC logo. Lag is terrible. Thanks man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-02 12:38:19	@PWMania He's also a junkie that is just barely getting his life together.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-02 16:28:58	Congrats to my son, who earned his blue belt this morning. See, hard work pays off. #KickAss
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-04 12:43:30	@CoolkidLexiJ So you can talk like a slave and that's ok, but if you were called aunt Jemima that would be an issue, right?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-04 13:13:35	@CoolkidLexiJ You proved my point you ignorant fool. Way to fail.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-04 16:06:02	@CoolkidLexiJ What a great way to go through life. Have fun with that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-05 22:00:46	@THENYGENERAL How so? Is it all brick shwag down there?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-05 22:01:32	@sternshow Lemme guess, a tax shelter house for 50 million in Florida?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-05 22:06:05	@Hanzi83 You sound like a closeted queer. Get a hold of yourself, fatty
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-05 22:30:20	@Hanzi83 It wasn't a guess. It was a declaration. Smarten up, dummy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-05 10:45:36	@OpieRadio Good. One less psycho.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-05 22:32:23	@AnthonyCumia Yeah, he would qualify as much as anyone. Stupid Nagel.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-07 12:51:04	@MichelleDBeadle Now that's a look I'd like to see.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-07 13:26:48	@hpdrifter85 @EastSideDave It made you want to? It made me do it against my will.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-10 02:46:31	@PatFuckinDuffy pics or it didn't happen....
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-08 00:51:15	@sternshow Yet she can't get her ass into the studio except when she wanted to plug her failed book?

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-17 03:39:07	@AnthonyCumia Looks pretty fuckable. She didn't bring her talking dildo with her, did she? By talking dildo I mean her husband.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-16 01:47:21	@kriztufer Looks very interesting. Added bookmark. Found a new vape store today. Mix their own juice as you order. Fanfuckingtastic!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-16 03:14:05	@MichelleDBeadle Good, because this is what I'm stuck looking at otherwise. http://t.co/LhPvHnOhyL

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-17 23:54:19	@FredBrooklyn No good? I was actually thinking of spending the $19.99 for the trial.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-16 17:43:16	@sethmikey My nine year old thinks because we went last year, we are automatically going this year. Daddy needs to sell a kidney.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-16 19:56:12	@FredBrooklyn I was gonna day your pics always look fuzzy. Good job Fred.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-19 01:46:27	@BigELangston Congrats!!!!! Well deserved, big man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-21 13:09:23	@BoomerandCarton Nice touch with Ace Frehley's "Rip It Out" bumper music!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-21 13:11:24	@BoomerandCarton You are one of the rare shows that actually plays full songs and not just musical loops. It's appreciated.  #RadioNerd
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-21 13:16:52	@BoomerandCarton Those people are turds.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-21 16:00:29	@notsam Anyone actually paying for a ticket to that is where shit got weird.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-23 14:11:57	@erockradio Have you seen this mornings google doodle? Cool Dr Who game you can play.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-24 01:53:26	@BeavisCumia Have you enjoyed the warmth of the fireplace yet, Beav?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-24 21:51:01	@shockthemonkee He has no future in the NFL.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-24 21:52:38	@notsam Great job with Vince Vaughn.  Too bad he was kind of a dead fish interview.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-03 00:56:02	@AnthonyCumia My buddy has been using nail clippers on his cats since they were kittens. When they're used to it, its a snap. #TeamBeavis
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-03 00:56:36	@boboxm103nyc Was that family member you, Daniel?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-03 14:35:16	@THENYGENERAL The sword of Wu can defeat anything or anyone.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-04 01:45:40	@Joelsherman1 So does that pretty much close the door on Granderson?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-04 03:17:30	@shockthemonkee What kind? Afgooey for me tonight.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-11-29 14:33:14	Yippee!!! I get to work today. Whoopdi fucking doo. That means I have to deal with stupid twats on the road. Yay.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-05 00:32:03	@CanadianBdog @RandomDonk I don't know. Ron has had it. After today, there is no doubt gonna be some type of change.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-05 00:38:40	@CanadianBdog @RandomDonk Listening since the .com days. He don't get that Ron's sick of an unfunny show. Thinks everyone is out to get him.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-05 00:52:01	@CanadianBdog @RandomDonk Sharpest mind on radio, hands down. Its kinda sad, it used to be a true two-man team.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-05 00:53:32	This tree lighting is horrible. Do they honestly think people like this?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-05 00:54:14	Poor All Roker looks like a deflated Thanksgiving balloon.

255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-05 13:37:43	RT @DRUDGE_REPORT: CNN: Does smoking pot cause man boobs? http://t.co/hLVDQx2dZd Just checked. It appears to be bullshit.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-04 12:57:12	@BMonzoWFAN Love the new avatar.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-04 13:18:12	@BoomerandCarton Do you have a link to that Arod article you were just talking about?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-06 17:54:54	@THENYGENERAL I'm still a bit behind. Is there a plan to fill that void on the channel?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-06 19:48:21	Hearing the Nature Boy again has given me chills. #FezIsBack #Ron&amp;Fez
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-06 14:16:26	@BoomerandCarton Lame, time wasting bit is getting old. Do you not have enough to talk about?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-06 17:59:01	@THENYGENERAL Maybe Tim really will get what he wants re: moving O&amp;A with H100... God I hope not.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-06 18:04:59	@THENYGENERAL Bob is funny, but the only way he should be on is as a guest.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-07 15:15:58	@JimNorton @notsam Your break on lousy TNA Impact wrestling made the wrasslin sites.  http://t.co/9xy0d4ppEF
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-06 22:52:00	@AnthonyCumia Thought you had a keg setup? Or is that just Bud Light?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-07 01:43:33	@OpieRadio Whomever it is, do you fully support them, or is it being thrust upon you?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-07 01:44:49	@BeavisCumia Some have wives. Some have girlfriends. Some have both......
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-07 01:48:05	@TheLisaSparks What a ridiculously stupid question. Sheesh.....
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-07 01:51:55	@TheLisaSparks Thanks for the reply, Lisa! Come to Jersey and do a signing. ;)
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-08 02:27:54	Goddammit, Fireball. You've got me in your clutches yet again.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-09 21:22:47	@HistoricalPics @erockradio Said the idiot who found it wise to deepthroat a shotgun barrel.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-08 17:55:53	@FredBrooklyn Does that mean if someone sucks your cock, they get lightheaded and giggly?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-08 18:16:49	@Alsboringtweets A catheter running up his pant leg.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-10 12:58:22	@FredBrooklyn Sounds like someone's got a case of the Tuesdays. #GuyWhoNeverGetsJokeRight Feel better, Fred.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-10 13:02:56	@THENYGENERAL Looks like he's trying to dance.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-10 13:11:52	@THENYGENERAL It looks exactly how black people make fun of white guys dancing.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-10 16:55:54	@OpieRadio @BSpier On H100?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-09 00:40:34	@BMonzoWFAN But they've lost 8 out of 14.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-10 20:54:32	@TheLisaSparks The only number that would matter is if one of them was me.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-11 18:42:12	@FredBrooklyn Don't kid yourself, he smelled just as bad two weeks ago.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-11 00:13:52	@lissy908marie Can you just tell us all what happened? Pretty please.......
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-12 12:58:15	@FredBrooklyn I almost want them to do what R&amp;F did yesterday and go to the other place, but can't blame them for being pissed.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-11 02:37:04	@shockthemonkee I remember watching this when it was brand spankin new. Kicked ass then, kicks ass now.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-12 14:01:02	@steveyknight @OpieRadio At the very least, they're not gonna deduct any sick days from you, are they?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-12 03:55:59	@AnthonyCumia Any news on the studio?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-12 11:41:33	@lissy908marie I do. Would love to know.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-12 11:57:41	@lissy908marie You really gotta just come out and say it. Stop fucking pussyfooting around. Explain what happened or move the fuck on.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-12 12:36:11	@MelissaStetten I made this movie called Dog Poop. It's about the poop of a dog.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-12 13:51:03	Time for that before work smoke. On the menu for today is some nice Afgooey. Chinese eyes, here I come.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-12 12:01:03	@lissy908marie Why? Because you're throwing yourself a pity party on twitter? Ok. Sounds good.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-16 13:05:03	@THENYGENERAL I've got the EXACT opposite problem. We should trade phones.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-17 01:18:19	@sethmikey So is this gonna be a title match or not? They weren't very clear about that fact.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-17 01:25:20	@OneNationRadio @sethmikey Yeah, that's what my son and I were thinking. Might as well have ADR fight Cena again as well. LAME!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-17 01:38:54	@OneNationRadio I was really happy about that. Dude needs a break. He's gotten kind of stale. Team him back up with Ricardo.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-17 01:43:36	@OneNationRadio No doubt a victim of bad booking.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-17 01:50:10	@OneNationRadio I'll read this tonight. Gave a glance, and saw Cornette was #2. Was watching a bunch of his shoots last night. Right on!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-17 01:50:45	@OneNationRadio Even sexier than she was last night.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-19 18:55:01	@KaitlynWWE You got a gingerbread man on your boobie.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-19 22:44:47	@FredBrooklyn that's it Fred, you're fired. We can't have that type of talk around here.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-21 14:46:06	@FredBrooklyn @AnthonyCumia Let me guess, four impoverished youths who were driven to a life of crime. Skin these animals alive.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-20 18:03:20	@OpieRadio "DUH! Cause I know how to do thid shit"  You sure do, Opie.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-20 18:22:36	@FredBrooklyn Fuck it. I'll throw my hat in the ring.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-20 19:10:49	@FredBrooklyn Thanks, Fred. Merry Christmas to you and yours.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-24 15:08:13	@OpieRadio Merry Christmas, Opie. Had lots of loffs watching and listening this past year. Thanks man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-24 15:09:28	@THENYGENERAL The blade of the Wu can destroy anything.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-24 17:04:24	Working on Christmas Eve sucks. Even worse is when the boss wants you to pre-wire a new install. Had to say no. Fuck em.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-24 17:17:28	@shockthemonkee No, but I won $5,000,000 in a Nigerian lottery. All I had to do was send my bank #'s and ssi #. I'm still waiting though.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-24 17:21:05	@BeavisCumia Are you hoping you get your balls back for Christmas?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-24 20:15:44	@JimNorton Nothing beats a good nose picking.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-25 01:19:01	@bpolijr  Yet you're the dope responding to his Chriatmas tweets.  #Who'sTheIdiot? @danawhite
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-25 13:41:04	@HeymanHustle Merry Christmas from our family and Brock Lesnar!!!!!! http://t.co/OpcnIyIDXT
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-25 01:34:22	@KaitlynWWE Noodles approves. http://t.co/Z4atThjMG1
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-25 01:46:11	@cc660 I may be wrong, but maybe he doesn't count the first 2 hrs because those would be lumped in with Joe and Evan's daypart.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-25 01:46:57	@OpieRadio Merry Christmas Opie and fam.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-21 18:47:42	Found this at Target. They've now got this poor kid on a greeting card. http://t.co/PGnIlqcnzr
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-25 23:40:59	@OpieRadio My little guy is zonked out from his busy day. Twist ties suck. http://t.co/GSk3LwRPBA
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-25 23:58:30	@IAmJericho Crazy Nights is one of the most underrated rock albums of the 80s.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-22 14:28:24	@Alsboringtweets I watched it so many times, the audio got all wobbly sounding. Good times.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-29 03:42:26	Very nice arm bar. #UFC168
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-29 05:45:44	@RandomDonk I'm suicide &amp; salvation
The omen to nations
That you worship on all 4s
I'm the infection and famine
That's knocking at your door
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-29 14:48:21	@RacistFrancesa Is that Kenny with his hands in the air like he just don't care?
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-26 17:53:46	@shockthemonkee No silly, it's the holiday that celebrates cardboard.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-30 02:18:40	@sethmikey Yeah, but he is basically a heavy for the Authority. In a few more months at most, this angle will end.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-30 02:24:59	@sethmikey Ok. Not a few, but four.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-30 02:26:18	@sethmikey One thing about it though, they are tied in one way or another to all the current top feuds.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-30 02:30:26	@sethmikey Agree 1000000000%
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-27 16:45:46	@RandomDonk Your observation's correct, I'm someone you can't neglect. 
Whoah no.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-27 16:50:39	@RandomDonk One of the MANY underrated KISS songs.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-27 16:56:10	@RandomDonk Its cool but there r so many "non rock" acts in it, is it a big deal?Madonna, Beasties, Grandmaster Flash?Really?Non are rock.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-27 16:58:41	@RandomDonk I agree, but it should be changed to the Music HOF.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-27 16:59:33	@RandomDonk I hope they are there, but wouldn't be surprised if they're not due to Paul (and mostly Gene)
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-27 17:04:24	@RandomDonk Well that would be great then.  No VV, I'm guessing.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-27 17:30:07	@RandomDonk IMO their best drummer. Animalize, Asylum and Crazy Nights were what got me hooked on them. Hated Hot In The Shade though.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-27 18:30:23	@KimKardashian It's hilarious that anyone would actually find that fashionable.#2Dopes
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-30 17:12:06	@cc660 Nice. My son loves watching you before school. What channel on Cablevison?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-01 02:35:25	Damn you, cream cheese filled cherry peppers. You got me again. #LactoseIntoleranceTour2013
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-01 02:43:41	@OpieRadio  Maybe she should be your new years kiss. #RatherGargleWithBrokenGlass
Happy New Years, Op.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-01 03:06:07	@kriztufer She gotta fix more than that, my brotha.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-01 03:07:12	@shockthemonkee Kinda thought the same thing while watching the Roseanne podcast. Maybe just some vacation?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-01 03:35:15	@BigELangston Yeah. But you have to take him. He's nine and a handful. :) Happy new years, E.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-01 06:34:22	@ChipChipperson Did it drop in your mouth, cocksucka? Tss tss.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-31 02:15:37	@OneNationRadio Sorry, my son made me vote for him. I did it only under extreme protest.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-31 02:16:20	@RandomDonk I would violate her in so many ways.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-31 02:17:17	@JohnGarces The line forms to the right.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-31 02:19:40	@OneNationRadio I was threatened with a barbwire bat. ;)
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-31 03:14:11	@OneNationRadio Agree 100%. Poor guy can barely make it down the ramp anymore.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-31 03:17:28	@OneNationRadio He walks like he has a kendo stick up his rectum.
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-31 03:24:58	@OneNationRadio Speaking of which....Kaitlyn....hubba hubba....
255161667	fredrogers75	2013-12-31 03:27:57	@TheOnlySherrod Thought the same thing, but Orton's did also in that same promo. Just a texture. His eyes looked funny.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-04 18:34:31	@robertkelly Kids don't knock on people's doors anymore. Assholes probably too scared of the whole rape/abduction thing.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-05 02:07:03	@shockthemonkee The answer to that is always YES......
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-04 03:03:38	@PatFuckinDuffy It sure does, Pat. It sure does.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-05 15:24:05	@OpieRadio Was this forced upon you? And wtf? No more @EastSideDave ? Kinda sucks, really.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-05 16:21:34	@OpieRadio Fuck. Is this what Tim brought to the table? Fuck, the more I think about it, the lousier it sounds.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-05 16:23:37	@EastSideDave  Fucking lame move by @SiriusXM .
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-05 18:50:59	@THENYGENERAL He sure does. A hatless Tim is a better Tim.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-06 16:34:07	@FredBrooklyn why break up the after show into 2 parts? Makes NO SENSE!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-06 16:42:14	@CanadianBdog You have a dial still? Awesome.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-06 16:50:39	@CanadianBdog Has life been good to you so far?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-06 16:59:50	@TheIBang Can't wit!!!!!!!!!! #Ron&amp;Fez
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-05 21:09:15	@OpieRadio Channel's a mess cuz of @SiriusXM management. Just cuz some other suit is in control don't matter.  @EastSideDave got fucked.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-05 21:17:55	@AnthonyCumia Any thoughts on @SiriusXM fucking @EastSideDave ?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-05 00:27:06	@OpieRadio Still a lot of game left.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-09 15:19:51	@THENYGENERAL @CanadianBdog @CreightonJk @SH4RKYx416  Free trials. Just saying.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-10 17:09:25	@dragonsegg75 I love YOU!!!!! Best thing that ever happened to me!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-10 17:26:27	@dragonsegg75 You are a tricker that performs trickery.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-10 17:35:55	@dragonsegg75 Don't you spell it "smartie"? Hmmmmm
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-10 17:49:07	@BeavisCumia Renn Faire Cat drinks his milk from a cup strapped onto his belt!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-12 00:29:21	@RandomDonk At first, we didn't think so, but replay showed why refs made the right call.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-12 00:32:18	@EastSideDave Is that the palace of suck &amp; fuck?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-12 00:33:56	@WFAN660 Oh.....Great.......No. Not really.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-10 21:37:10	@notsam Only thing that stinks with the new format is there's not enough time for interviews.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-14 18:23:18	@OpieRadio no thanks, Opie. I had to shut it off this morning. Could not even listen to it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-13 21:53:46	@BeavisCumia @AnthonyCumia I wasn't aware that there were any coons in your neighborhood, Beavis.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-13 22:56:34	@murderbydeath You guys recording them?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-13 22:57:39	@notsam @DJWhookid and 4 of his friends came over?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-14 23:09:54	@BShopWindow Fuck those people. No one can take a joke anymore.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-15 00:27:55	@BMonzoWFAN The end of RAW last night was great. The guy is no doubt the most popular on the roster.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-14 03:30:32	@CMPunk No one inducts The Warrior. He runs to the stage like a maniac, does an air gorilla press and vanishes into thin air.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-14 04:10:26	@RhymesWithPen Noticed the same thing laying on my couch. Realized the grin was from ear to ear.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-14 04:12:36	@OneNationRadio At least this latest storyline didn't last long. Think creative realized it was a lame ass idea.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-14 04:13:27	@WrestleSubtitle Not me.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-14 12:54:15	@NekoCase Coming from a jukebox repairman, no you don't. Trust me.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-17 13:43:02	@JimNorton @racerxdad125 That don't make no sense.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-18 16:39:28	@CMPunk And that's the only reason anyone should ever enter that place.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-15 12:54:36	@Buster_ESPN Tacopina didn't name names, but that didn't stop you, did it? That list of 100 should have been leaked long ago.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-19 00:49:37	@CanadianBdog Oh, I thought you meant invent the internet.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-17 22:08:56	@rolandos99 Did you get accepted somewhere? That Target sitch stinks.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-19 04:28:26	@RobbyTheBrain You better be doing "the walk".
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-21 05:02:39	@WWERollins But only one of you gets to win............
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-21 12:07:46	@PatFuckinDuffy Crank or blow?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-21 12:09:35	@JimNorton Because they wanna fuck her. Fuck her right in the puss.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-20 17:56:10	@IAmJericho Cool alternate pic from the back cover of Crazy Nights.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-22 04:42:46	@kriztufer Phillip is fucking nutso.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-23 15:41:42	@PatFuckinDuffy Which witch is which?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-23 19:57:43	@notsam @aubreysitterson Listened this morning. Great podcast!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-23 21:26:28	@BMcCarthy32 I'm a Yankees fan as well but @adiaz106 is a douchebag. Keep it classy, fucknut.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-23 23:28:31	@RobbyTheBrain Damn man. That works for me.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-23 23:29:35	@deandelray @billburr Carmine's got a wig Maury would be proud of.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-23 23:31:16	@AnthonyCumia No. They were stale and outdated by noon today.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-24 14:46:44	@JonHeymanCBS Headline talks about drew but the article is only about Matt Harvey.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-24 14:49:20	@erockradio When I was a wee lad, I'd make my own slime, go into the shower, say the magic words and pur it over my head. #80'sDork
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-24 14:50:21	@erockradio Did you like the chunky, oatmeal type slime or the slime that looked like Ninja Turtle Ooze?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-24 14:56:46	@JonHeymanCBS No, thank you Jon. Have a great weekend.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-24 15:39:57	Mr. fuckin balloon hands. This guy hates the cold. http://t.co/gun06ziYo4
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-25 02:27:49	@CanadianBdog What did he do?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-25 02:28:31	@JoeandEvan @daveg2450 Thoughts on Sheamus returning? I say its a lock.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-25 02:31:28	@CanadianBdog Then it serves him right.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-25 02:51:02	@RobbyTheBrain Still drinkin? ;)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-27 03:52:11	@notsam The fans have been heard. Only question is what @WWE will do about it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-27 03:57:54	RT @WalderSports: El Torito had a spot. JBL had a spot. A guy from developmental even had a spot. Daniel Bryan? Nope. #RoyalRumble @WWE

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-27 04:06:58	@WrestleRant So far, 2 shit matches.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-26 20:18:35	@aubreysitterson True but would you really want to see him tonight @ #RoyalRumble ?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-26 20:21:58	@aubreysitterson I kinda agree. Ok, top 5 surprise entrants for tonight????
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-26 20:28:06	@aubreysitterson Already done, friend. Wanted to know if any thoughts have changed. As boring as he was when he left, I want Sheamus back.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-26 20:29:15	@notsam @VanessaHudgens Listening right now!! See ya at PWS in Feb!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-26 20:32:46	@aubreysitterson Thats the thing. Didn't have enough space to say I'd want him back as a total heel. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-27 17:56:17	@RobbyTheBrain @WWE as someone who gets absolutely every PPV, this one will make me think twice about signing on to WWE Network.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-25 16:48:04	@PatFuckinDuffy What did this asshat do?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-26 00:04:45	@RobbyTheBrain  Hands down, no question about it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-28 01:36:32	@aubreysitterson He's great. His Real American shtick is getting old though. Swagger is as useless on the mic as he is in the ring.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-29 02:55:23	@AnthonyCumia @AgathaC80 Absolutely. Fair is fair. Same percentage (not amount) for everyone. What's wrong with that?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-28 03:38:35	@OneNationRadio You're insane.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-28 03:57:41	@OneNationRadio Other than Natayla, she's the best the Diva's division has to offer in terms of in ring skill.

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-01-30 12:45:36	@shockthemonkee Are they asking SB questions? If so, they are ripping off Mike &amp; The Mad Dog's bit they did for years.

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-04 01:30:14	@RobbyTheBrain Too bad the cameras try to hide the blood as much as possible these days.

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 03:22:03	@JoeRodFromTheBx Then Bret Hart is a bitter little bitch.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 17:22:34	@DatHEEL No, the fact that neither has ANY mic skills whatsoever doomed them.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 17:24:32	@DatHEEL You still haven't given any examples as to how.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 17:28:30	@DatHEEL So because the bookers wanted him to win, that's him burying them?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 17:45:21	@DatHEEL No. They did it themselves. No charisma, no mic skills did them in.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-17 01:37:07	@JRsBBQ Looks delish. How's the weather by you JR?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-17 01:40:36	@blackcell @JoeRogan @DuncanTrussel One in four Americans apparently brain dead. Methinks its more like 2/4 or 3/4. #WeAreDoomed
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 18:03:03	@DatHEEL Lack of charisma, mic skills and booking buried them. The only reason they were paired with Heyman was cause neither can talk.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 18:20:51	@DatHEEL You are sorely mistaken.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 18:48:29	@DatHEEL Not my fault you don't seem to know what the term burying even means.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 19:05:16	@DatHEEL Aww, someone can't have a conversation like a real adult. Go cry to mommy, baby.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 19:16:02	@DatHEEL The bookers of WWE creative make that up, not the guys in the locker room.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 19:26:59	@DatHEEL My point (pertaining to Axel + Ryback) is that their sheer lameness and the wishes of creative buried them.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 19:29:25	@DatHEEL Also, are you telling me creative wanted them (Ryback/Axel) to win cleanly and Punk refused?Are you kidding me? Punk's lost plenty.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 19:30:54	@DatHEEL Yeah but its not Punk burying them. What I'm trying to impress upon you is that it is ALWAYS creative. no one else can do that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 19:50:53	@DatHEEL You said the magic word. Booked.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 19:54:08	@DatHEEL The only people slamming Cena for it are fools. He has as much to do with it as Punk. Creative, creative, creative.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 19:59:37	@DatHEEL Leave? Where is he gonna go? He makes a lot of money, and makes a lot of money for the company. And he has lost his fair share too
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 20:27:53	@DatHEEL No, we seem to differ on the fact that it was not Punk or Cena burrying anybody. Its creative. Its always creative.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-18 22:52:20	@DatHEEL Poor little bitch makes an ass outta herself and gets all butthurt when she doesn't like someone's opinion. http://t.co/jhTI7Kfvsu

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-20 12:47:09	Except for finding out that you are out of coils.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-21 00:32:20	@notsam A new episode? Why on a Thursday?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-21 01:52:11	@RobbyTheBrain "I'm An Ass Man" #WWEDebate
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 00:51:52	Why have a commercial during the pre show match? Fucking lame. #WWECHAMBER
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 00:55:39	@JoeandEvan Do you want to see him win or just judging by the losses he's had the last couple weeks?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 00:57:03	@JoeandEvan Agreed. He's lost too much lately to lose again tonight.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 01:07:12	@RobbyTheBrain Agreed. Simply horrible.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 01:20:48	@RobbyTheBrain The spear through the ropes was pretty badass.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 01:21:31	@AnthonyCumia @NYCVixen Fantasyland
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-15 22:02:04	Hot sake tastes and smells like dirty socks. I'll stick with the mai tai, thank you. http://t.co/CAlTKGllbD
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 02:01:50	@RobbyTheBrain Finally a good match tonight.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 02:02:22	"This is awesome" chants before the match even starts. Nice.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 02:08:32	@Lux_Suicide The same creature that sleeps like this: http://t.co/TfY5sYh2Ae
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 02:12:22	@aubreysitterson I'll be there.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 02:41:44	@erockradio @WWEUniverse That was the best match it I've seen in a good couple years.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 02:44:27	@notsam @wwe Just said to @erockradio that it was the best match I've seen in the last couple years. #WellDone
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 02:46:02	@notsam @aubreysitterson There seems to be a lot of guys saying the same thing on twitter. I mean, he IS dreamy and all.....
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 02:56:46	@TripleH Listen to Black Sabbath lately? ;)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 02:58:57	@jtg80 @PatFuckinDuffy I second that. We've all been there. I know it sounds like complete BS, but in time you'll feel and be better.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 03:00:18	@RobbyTheBrain My wife said the same exact thing. Creepy as hell.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 03:02:41	@RobbyTheBrain How can WWE knowingly put him in the main event?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 03:04:21	@IAmJericho Its not just Minneapolis that wants ya back!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 03:05:49	@RobbyTheBrain Don't hate, just think they're using him incorrectly. Fans are showing they're not happy. I agree with the fans.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 03:30:34	@aubreysitterson I was waiting for that all night.... #SoLameItsGreat
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-15 23:42:22	@boboxm103nyc Bobo, if you're still a virgin, it IS all about getting laid.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 03:58:17	@sethmikey Lousy for what's supposed to be an xtra special 'Mania. If we didn't have the Network by then, I wouldn't spend any money on it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 04:00:45	@sethmikey Same here, doesn't mean we should settle for not only mediocrity but sheer lameness.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-24 04:04:06	@OneNationRadio Nope
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-16 14:14:03	Who is this boring asshole on @WFAN660 ? Where's Talking Baseball?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-21 13:21:18	@RichVos Good job, Rich. Now let's go celebrate with a couple of drinks.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-23 09:37:32	@AnthonyCumia Gold Toes. Nice.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-25 02:01:15	@NancyGraceHLN You realize that "100+ rounds of ammo" isn't a lot whatsoever. For a gun owner, that's actually a pretty small amount. #Idiot
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-25 02:03:28	@AnthonyCumia Ant, how many rounds of ammo do YOU have? #NancyWouldShitHerManPants
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-25 03:01:24	@aubreysitterson My wife said, "what's wrong with him?"
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-26 04:12:32	@BMonzoWFAN how's it working for you? My wife says the xbox360 isn't working and on the comp the on demand is kind of crappy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-26 04:13:17	Phase one complete. Finish up in 2 weeks. http://t.co/uhtre5nwiY
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-26 04:14:25	@BMonzoWFAN Lucky
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-27 12:33:54	@notsam  @OandAshow Nevermind that goofball. So, why no show? Please don't tell me mgmt is mad about the Todd Show.....
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-27 20:08:23	@WWENetwork Nothing!!!! XBox 360 STILL NOT WORKING!!!!!!! FIX IT PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-27 20:15:46	@TripleH #NXTArrival When do you expect @RealPaigeWWE to join the main roster?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-01 19:45:09	@sethmikey Correct. You're basically turning your 4g into WiFi for others.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-01 19:50:54	@sethmikey You can if you have another device but you'll be using your data mins. If you just have your phone, there's no need for it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-01 19:51:55	@sethmikey You can turn your data(4g) into a wifi hotspot for other devices.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-26 19:14:25	@PatFuckinDuffy Spring training makes me happy. Here, take a look at last night's fun...... http://t.co/MwYxT0bIAL
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-26 21:11:58	@TheOnlySherrod I'm aight, thanks for asking.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-01 01:44:57	@erockradio Wow, what a fat tub of goo. #TheToddShow #TeamScott
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-02 15:42:53	@BMonzoWFAN Don't tell us you've waited 'til now to get one.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-02 16:13:59	@BMonzoWFAN @JoeandEvan Also, reports of a third superstar in the main event of WM30. Maybe Punk finally got his wish......
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-02 16:32:00	@BMonzoWFAN Honestly, I'd love it to be Daniel Bryan. 70+ chanting YES to close out WM would be epic.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-28 02:41:39	Anybody else having trouble with #wwenetwork once the main event started?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-28 02:47:31	@aubreysitterson Kind of shitty right when the main event started though......
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-27 00:30:39	@notsam Bah God, thats great!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-27 00:32:47	@cigarsNscotch Watch it buddy or I'll have Daniel Tiger slash your tires.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-27 00:35:30	@sethmikey No idea. I've wondered the same thing. Saw them at Access last year and Paige was a waaay better rassler.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-02-27 00:51:27	@sethmikey So you think Paige will retain tomorrow night?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-02 19:05:44	@RobbyTheBrain my guess is he got his wish by being the third man in the main event.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-02 21:22:50	@notsam when/where is your interview with Good Ol JR?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-03 01:04:10	@ronandfezsxm And now here's a guy that just ate a bunch of chocolate.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-03 01:05:17	@OpieRadio It needs to wear a fucking bra.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-03 01:13:59	@AnthonyCumia I thought he had just eaten a shitload of chocolates.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-03 01:31:53	@RonAndFexSXM I'm guessing Ellen got her shirt from Seinfeld.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-04 02:41:56	"This is awful" chants raining down. #WWERaw
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-04 00:55:01	@WWE Xbox360 updated the app for #WWENetwork tonight!!!!!!! Works like a charm!!!!!!!!! Thanks guys.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-04 01:01:59	Nice @ColtCabana big head in the crowd at #WWERaw
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-04 01:06:10	@aubreysitterson But its always been his gimmick.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-04 01:35:51	@sethmikey @WWEUsos They gotta do something to appease this crowd.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-04 02:33:19	@notsam Novel idea, isn't it?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-04 02:36:18	@aubreysitterson Saw her @ Axxess in April, she was doing fine without him.Don't get me wrong, he helps but it's not needed as you'd think.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-04 02:36:36	@RobbyTheBrain I know I am.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-04 02:41:12	@aubreysitterson True but she had a great in-ring presence almost a complete year ago.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-04 02:50:32	@RobbyTheBrain Waste of valuable time.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-04 03:33:14	#PaulBearer #WWEHOF Well deserved!!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-05 05:15:57	@BeavisCumia I envision a cornucopia filled with all sorts of cakey goodness.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-04 23:41:03	@BeavisCumia Ouch.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-05 01:58:10	@sethmikey While I LOVE @realmickfoley , it's gotta be 'Taker.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-05 22:48:50	@aubreysitterson I watched it the other day when you tweeted about it.  Great closed circuit fun from the old days.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-04 23:43:22	@BeavisCumia He won't wear fur but has a fucking lion on his arm? How tough.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-06 03:29:42	@EllisMate It's spelled THEIR, you fucking buffoon.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-06 03:35:30	@Justin_Stangel You're gonna kill poor Fezzie, trust me.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-06 03:58:54	@BeavisCumia Lol, what the fuck is that? A baby carrot or a drinking straw?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-06 15:19:46	@BeavisCumia @jackiefreitas8 Oh my goodness. Hilarious.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-06 15:24:11	@jackiefreitas8 @BeavisCumia Anthony looks like a skinny version of Eddie Guerrero.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-06 16:06:27	@THENYGENERAL Someone's arms look a little ashy.....
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-06 16:36:58	@AnthonyCumia There you go, engaging in shock jockery yet again. You're a real pip, Ant. #LoveYouLoveTheShow
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-06 20:11:34	@RonandFezSXM All very solid guests, but when are ya getting @OpieRadio &amp; @AnthonyCumia in studio?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-07 22:55:38	@MeghanMcCain I see what you did there.......
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-07 23:22:49	@RandomDonk How about cars made of weed?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-08 00:26:57	@OpieRadio Maybe @EastSideDave should have just shown up and not said a word. He'd still be getting paid like others we know.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-08 00:28:50	@THENYGENERAL @OpieRadio @EastSideDave It's easy. Don't talk, but when you do, just yell at people like a maniac.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-08 00:33:50	@THENYGENERAL @OpieRadio @EastSideDave "Its gonna happen. Trust me" Here, have these matches.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-08 00:43:40	@THENYGENERAL "This is not a part of the entertainment. This is real life."
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-07 03:47:43	@CanadianBdog get over it, get over it........
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-07 03:50:36	@TripleH Any word on why so much content is missing on the Xbox app? Mobile and PC are great, but we need full content on xbox 360 please.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-08 12:15:39	@Robertc1967 @OpieRadio Yeah, but it wasn't a train.......
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-07 15:25:16	@EastSideDave So why did @SiriusXM bring you guys back for 2 weeks?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-07 20:30:54	@AnthonyCumia @NYCVixen It'd be better if he was a mo. #OnSecondThought
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-07 20:49:04	@FredBrooklyn Who ya talkin about?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-09 00:11:38	@RobbyTheBrain I'm a couple Guinness's in but I agree 100%.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-09 02:27:54	@AnthonyCumia Yes, a couple chromosomes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-11 00:27:01	$10000.00 says that dude with the "call me" sign has someone else's phone number on it. His buddy is gonna be fucking pissed.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-11 00:40:04	@DFParker78 @OpieRadio I always wanted to be a part of your crew.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-11 02:11:37	Now this is a WM I can sink my teeth into!!!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-11 02:12:34	Finally!!!!! A match at #WM30 that people will go nuts for!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-14 03:43:57	@rvaldes11 No one can be surprised anymore. EVERYONE that douche comes in contact with can't stand him. Hes turned himself into a huge joke.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-14 03:51:32	@JimNorton Team thief. Or sumptin.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-14 04:12:25	@RockinRobWalker Who the fuck hasn't? The prince is a complete cock hound.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-14 04:15:00	@MichelleDBeadle I didn't know there was one.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-14 04:16:08	@RockinRobWalker You say that like it's a bad thing.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-11 00:13:21	@RobbyTheBrain Dude is spittin a promo in the face of a living legend. Guy's got some real talent......
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-11 00:16:34	@RobbyTheBrain He creeps my kid out, but at the same time, my son loves him.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-11 00:38:44	@aubreysitterson He's always wearing cheap Affliction style shirts.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-11 02:09:48	@RobbyTheBrain Unfortunately it doesn't look like it's in the cards, although to save the show, it should be.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-11 02:11:02	@RobbyTheBrain Holy shit was I wrong!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-11 03:37:50	@RobbyTheBrain Yeah but that's a huge IT. They can potentially save WM. A very big deal.

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-13 23:09:08	@shockthemonkee No, @BeavisCumia is a fancy cat, just like his pops is a fancy man.

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-20 12:17:12	@FredBrooklyn At least the lousy Irish brogue is gone.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-21 04:23:41	@BeavisCumia I won't report you for spam, but I will report you for a cheeseburger or sumptin. Tssss tssss....

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-20 23:31:57	@jdharm Fatty and The Twink.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-22 15:16:45	@erockradio Was never a fan of hard cider. Let us know if ya try it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-24 19:10:13	@Alsboringtweets Just throw them in the freezer for a week. They're delicious that way.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-26 01:24:53	@MelissaStetten She also patented the term "narcissistic cunt".
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-25 20:17:43	@lushcosmetics you need to come back to Menlo Park Mall in Edison. Pretty please?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-25 22:00:12	@lushcosmetics My entire family would love that. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-26 13:30:03	@OandAshow Please update some of your bumper bits. Its getting really old hearing dating line bits, Jimmy bus bit, Breuer/Lars bit. PLEASE.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-26 13:59:35	@kingado @JimNorton Its from the Dynasty promos.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-28 19:20:12	@ChadBrown4 @MichelleDBeadle There's an awful lot of one dollar bills in your hand, playa. #WannaBeBaller
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-29 03:15:00	@MichelleDBeadle who wouldn't pay to have those hands on him is an idiot.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-30 19:47:49	@JennyJohnsonHi5 Can we forgo the coffee and do the tuck anyway?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-31 22:14:15	You'd think after just getting the shocks changed on a company vehicle 3 weeks ago, one wouldn't decide to just fall off while driving.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-03-31 22:14:42	Fucking sitting on rt 18 waiting for a fucking tow truck. #FuckMe
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 00:48:30	@erockradio Did you notice last week, 'Taker had a lot of great roots I'm his goatee. Now they're gone. Deamn magic, I tell ya.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 01:02:53	@nicoleandbri Agree 100%!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 01:05:49	@BeavisCumia Us. Goddamn my sausage fingers.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 01:08:11	@TheOnlySherrod A one fall match with all of them? For the title? Fucking lame.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 01:10:20	@OneNationRadio He is in serious contention. One of my all time faces, but he's become a MONSTER heel!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 01:10:46	@RandomDonk Flat out terrible.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 01:11:07	@RandomDonk He makes Orton look like Punk.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 02:12:43	@aubreysitterson The comments were pretty complimentary. He was putting Fandango over while telling the fans to...um.... suck it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 02:13:35	@sethmikey Trips cut one of THE BEST heel promos ever.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 02:17:09	@shockthemonkee I've been married almost 15 years. There's a lot I remember. There's even more that I don't remember.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 02:21:18	@aubreysitterson Had to go with Reigns.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 02:28:00	@shockthemonkee Best to move it all to cash and hide it. Quickly. No, I'm not joking. Trust me.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 02:29:36	@shockthemonkee Turn it to cash, hide it with a very trusted person and when she comes looking for it, you say you lost it all in Vegas.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 02:30:16	@sethmikey Agreed. But damn, it was a good one.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 02:33:15	@shockthemonkee Sleep well, pal.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 12:04:53	@WFAN660 The Yankees season hinges on 25 guys. What a novel idea.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 12:05:31	@shockthemonkee A steam pipe needs to vent once in a while or it bursts.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 01:04:54	@BeavisCumia You trying to pull an Edgar on is, Beav?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 01:20:00	@OneNationRadio He's really doing a superb job on the mic lately. A true heir to the greatest heel of all time, Mr. McMahon.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 01:20:35	@realmickfoley Love the crew cut look, Mick.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 01:22:00	@lisarinna So then where is it, genius?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 02:09:48	@aubreysitterson He was never going anywhere. He don't have the mic skills to be a good, all around wrestler. The arrest also didn't help.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 02:15:57	@sethmikey Watch it first. Then tell us you still feel that way. Nothing too great, but the HHH promo was worth it alone.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 02:25:35	@shockthemonkee You probably don't want/need to hear the actual answer to that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 02:31:13	@steveaustinBSR Maybe its all an elaborate April fools joke.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-04 11:25:51	@RacistFrancesa I think @ChefFrancoVitel is saying that he's a queeb. Or possibly a quay.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-04 11:40:46	@RacistFrancesa @ChefFrancoVitel He's too busy thinking about a juicy sausage at the moment.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-02 12:21:07	@ChipChipperson He must be cuz he's green with envy or sumptin. Tss..
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 12:06:05	@amyschumer @HowardStern I'm sorry to hear that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 18:35:14	@NekoCase I add your albums yo every jukebox I work on. #SpreadTheWord http://t.co/d4WJSIf9Tw http://t.co/jglXR7duyp
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-02 15:58:11	@AgathaC80 @AnthonyCumia What does that have to do with it? He's covered under his parents. They were forced to switch to an inferior plan.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-01 22:43:23	@notsam @aubreysitterson Gave a listen/look yet again. Great job guys!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-02 00:13:26	@EdgarMellencamp You sure have a fascination with the moon and moon ricks, don't ya eDgaR?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-02 00:14:22	@EdgarMellencamp Rocks, goddammit. There go those sausage fingers again.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-04 23:40:37	@notsam You were mentioned in Daniel Bryan's wrestlemania diary today on http://t.co/6G7RtKQKUd. Good job. #TrulyAProfessionalBroadcaster
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-05 12:44:49	@TMZ Yeah, but he wants it to include himself and 2 other guys.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-05 14:24:16	@FredBrooklyn That's just the name of the fisherman they spotted.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-02 23:54:33	@BeavisCumia Is that directed at your pops and the Seinfeld references? ;)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-03 01:19:30	@JonHeymanCBS Still rockin' a Blackberry, Jon? #OldSchool
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-03 01:21:48	@OpieRadio @balaneski Just like Appetite For Destruction, Ten is great from beginning to end.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-06 01:47:48	@notsam Hey Sam, when are your interviews from media day gonna be online at http://t.co/IHSOORjwF1 ?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-06 02:13:55	@OpieRadio I gagged just reading that. Did the sock have pee on it?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-08 02:19:55	Congrats @realpaigewwe !!!!! Awesome!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 00:01:59	@BMonzoWFAN My wife and I looked at each and burst out laughing...
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 00:20:08	Seriously? Yoshi Tatsu as one of the unnamed entrants? LAME!!!!! #WM30
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 00:37:05	@TheOnlySherrod Dude deserves it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 00:40:58	@RobbyTheBrain Guy is a super talented powerhouse. Huge things in his future.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 00:43:07	@erockradio If you guys are there, is the show live tomorrow?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 00:43:35	@erockradio And by you guys, I mean you and @notsam .
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 00:45:15	@aubreysitterson Only thing that would be better is if they were maroon corduroys.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 00:50:24	@aubreysitterson My nine year old just if Cena's gonna turn heel tonight.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 01:22:07	Surprised the Taker/Lesnar fight is before the Divas match. Weird. #Wrestlemania
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 01:58:01	Holy Fuck. #WM30
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 02:19:09	@erockradio Yeah but the match itself was sub par.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 02:20:04	@MunchVeevers I think I saw the odds were 50-1. Someone made a mint.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 02:20:28	@BMonzoWFAN Please god no.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 02:22:22	@TheOnlySherrod It was an ok match. Nothing we haven't seen many times before. So many of Undertaker's past WM matches were far better.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 02:25:18	@sethmikey @LWeir12 Maybe since Taker didn't have total creative freedom with this match he said "fuck it, I'm losing"
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 02:30:08	@Duowe2000 @OneNationRadio The silverdome would go nuts.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 02:30:42	@aubreysitterson Those aren't stars, those are cherry blossoms.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 02:32:11	@LWeir12 @sethmikey Could be. He really hasn't looked great the last month or so that we've seen him.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 02:34:37	@LWeir12 @sethmikey But if that's the case, why wouldn't they just end it early with Taker getting the pin?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 02:49:57	@MelissaStetten He's gonna spray thermite paint on them and watch them explode.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 03:12:59	@erockradio How do you watch it? It had a couple buffering issues on the 360, but nothing was lost. Picked up where it left off.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 03:15:16	@RobbyTheBrain Not that he lost, but how and to whom he lost is what doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 03:17:53	@notsam How were your seats?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 03:49:06	@tomsegura As a matter of fact, we watched it in a fort made of Transformer and Toy Story bed sheets.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 03:50:14	@IAmJericho Was there ever any talk of you facing Taker at a past WM?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 03:53:39	@BMonzoWFAN Only issues were mainly on XBox and they were very minor buffering issues.Always picked up where it left off.WWE pulled it off.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 03:54:58	@IAmJericho @TheReign5136 Not to mention Taker didn't have as much creative control as in years past.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 04:13:35	@JoeandEvan Didn't want to spoil it for you since it seemed you were delayed by twitter baseball. Kind of a weird choice to end it, right?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 05:00:21	@WWEAJLee Congrats. You were my choice since that match was announced. #BlackWidowKilledIt
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-08 10:55:13	@miamidecor @AnthonyCumia Too bad there was all this other stuff called EVIDENCE.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-09 04:03:07	@erockradio Fucking crazy. I was just about to go to sleep. Now I'm wide awake. Fuck.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-09 04:45:48	@ClassicShelb That's why Fezzy won't answer. He was out on a mission. A mission to kill The Ultimate Warrior.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-09 11:13:55	@NekoCase Fuck those people. If I could follow you twice, I would.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-06 13:59:20	@CodyRhodesWWE Noodles says he doesn't like the snow. Thank God spring is here. http://t.co/OUwZ9lRms5
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-09 03:49:06	@aubreysitterson Did you just read what @TripleH just tweeted?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 19:48:13	@AnthonyCumia A white sheet is simple and innocent also.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-09 11:16:08	@TammyPescatelli @ksunurse Not funny....HILARIOUS.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-07 21:29:40	@ChrisCarlinSNY If the majority of answers didn't say Major League, something is terribly wrong.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-08 00:04:57	@RhymesWithPen @USPS And they wonder why they are going bankrupt.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-08 01:05:52	@RobbyTheBrain Sitting on a couch still seeing stars.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-10 12:31:22	@CBSGonzalez @daynperry Just like the flag they set ablaze. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-12 17:58:08	@AnthonyCumia How long does it take to get to a temp you like?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-11 11:45:44	@shockthemonkee We all do.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-11 11:50:57	@DRUDGE_REPORT Yeah, but ya get a hard pecka.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-12 21:23:40	@shockthemonkee Not too young but I'll do it if you listen to Murder By Death. Fantastic band...

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-13 02:45:29	@LinzBella Goddamn. Now that's what a woman should look like.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-11 14:36:47	@LinzBella Definitely a mo. Maybe a queeb. And quite possibly a quay.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-11 15:28:48	@TheBethPhoenix Friendly's was a childhood staple.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-14 19:10:01	@twerkcunt Good.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-14 20:16:19	@shockthemonkee No, its to scale. That chick just has a really huge twat, that's all
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-10 20:02:31	@BeavisCumia Today? No. Every day? Absolutely.

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-10 22:37:02	@BeavisCumia Agreed. While Bobo is a true dope, he's pretty much harmless.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-10 22:49:17	@shockthemonkee Had one the size of a large marble once. When I blasted, it felt great! Like scratching a monster itch.

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-14 22:43:02	@AnthonyCumia Not trying to be a dick but if pistols need a reg, why would it matter if "assault" rifles do also? Seriously just asking.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-14 22:45:08	@BeavisCumia Does that make you both queebs or just Bob? Or maybe a quay?

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-11 01:14:19	@BeavisCumia Does she try to misspell and use Bobo grammar on purpose or does the apple not fall that far from the tree?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-11 01:30:20	@BeavisCumia Beav, all he wants to do is show you his pecker. Don't tempt him.

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-11 02:10:08	@Roose_TCL @IAmJericho Nothing at all. RRHOF only would induct 4 original KISS members but it's ok for other bands to induct everyone.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-11 02:17:55	@WWEFandango Say hi to @JimNorton .  He oiled up your chest last year on @OandAshow before WM29. He's there tonight.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-11 02:30:06	@SunilSunderRaj3 @ChrisCarlinSNY is too healthy looking.  No, seriously.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-11 21:01:48	@shockthemonkee Independent Worm Saloon fucking rocked though.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-11 21:32:12	@boboxm103nyc Right. Sure it was.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-12 03:35:13	@PatFrmMoonachie Their homemade mustard relish makes me want to hump a tree.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-16 11:25:22	@FredBrooklyn Silly Fred. Fez doesn't do heroin.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-16 13:52:01	@NekoCase Done deal.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-16 16:28:30	@LinzBella You are. #WCW beeotch. ;)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-16 16:32:28	@LinzBella 2 possible reasons. They are either stupid, or they are intimidated. #ImNeitherYoureIncredible
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-16 16:47:47	@EastSideDave @tlc Did Tim Pangburn do it? He's ridiculously good.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-16 17:13:18	@LinzBella Jeans and a pair of pasties will work just fine.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-12 12:49:25	@LinzBella Fuck em. Not literally, figuratively.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-12 13:17:01	@JoeandEvan The past week of wwe news.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-12 14:07:05	@shockthemonkee My bud makes butter &amp; brownies out of it. Last time I ate one I thought I was losing my mind. And I'm an every day smoker.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-12 14:07:56	@AnthonyCumia No, apparently it makes you a racist for pointing out the truth.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-17 00:54:50	@JennyJohnsonHi5 My question is, if you're gonna off yourself, why mess with your prick like that beforehand?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-15 17:15:51	@FredBrooklyn What's up with that? I remember you were annoyed about the site a week or so ago, just wondering.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-15 17:32:44	@FredBrooklyn Fair enough, sir. Fair enough.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-16 02:03:48	@ChipChipperson I listened to all 41 minutes. If there was a way to run my own head over, I would.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-16 02:04:59	@OttoAndGeorge I'm sorry for your loss. He was one hell of an original.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-16 02:06:01	@AnthonyCumia Shinkle 'bout it......
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-18 12:44:01	@LinzBella @Yen_Vi @RealReginaMe Did ya touch each others cootahs or sumptin? Tssss...
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-21 22:36:10	@JennyJohnsonHi5 Agree 100%.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-22 00:22:56	@JimNorton Lemme guess, is this some wonderful "religion of peace"?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-22 00:23:28	@RobbyTheBrain How's that?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-22 00:24:21	@RobbyTheBrain You can't seriously expect people from Alabama to know how to clap, can you?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-22 00:25:51	@EastSideDave I actually set my alarm for it so I don't forget. You should let someone lick it. For goofs, ya know?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-22 00:43:52	@JennyJohnsonHi5 Barely fuckable is more like it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-22 00:45:22	@RobbyTheBrain If I had to choose between Both or that dancing-with-bunnies mo, then I'm a #Boliever
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-19 00:08:24	@OpieRadio @AnthonyCumia Wife brought one home. I need to get this out of here, I have no self control. http://t.co/aEXwosxKKR
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-19 14:00:34	@LinzBella Goddamb, that's a purdy car.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-19 14:05:04	@LinzBella When you find that person , tell them to get me one also please.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-20 00:00:47	@NekoCase @Horse_Divorce If the original cross was made of yummy confections, the Romans would have had a harder time nailing Jesus to it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-20 01:15:15	@notsam @JimNorton Do those zippers on your sleeve actually serve a purpose?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-22 01:13:48	@aubreysitterson Isn't he the guy you want to hold hands with and frolic in a field of daisies with?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-22 01:49:54	@aubreysitterson Same here. Maybe some asshole rushed the ring or something.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-22 01:50:30	@erockradio I'd lick it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-22 01:50:56	@RobbyTheBrain Maybe some jerk tried to rush the ring.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-22 02:16:40	@EastSideDave @TLC Dave, I've seen that lousy tat since the day you got it. Congrats!!! The new one is killer!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-21 11:56:50	@Alsboringtweets @cc660 Gotta be you, Al. Craig looks like he wipes his head and face with carrot juice. #OrangeIsNotASkinTone
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-21 17:55:17	@Celebrity_UKnws @HeymanHustle The fact that you even have to ask makes you inept. #ImAPaulHeymanGuy
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-24 22:38:59	@pokeyberlin @JimNorton That's the thing about the USA, you have the freedom to not like it. And people have the freedom to piss people off.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-24 23:25:21	@carinaround @puscifer It looks fine. Did your boobies mistakenly pop out or something?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-25 00:02:39	@jeromemoorhead @carinaround @puscifer We wish, Jerry.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-25 22:40:41	@shockthemonkee Stretch it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-25 22:41:54	@OpieRadio I'm standing in my kitchen cringing. Eegads, Op.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-26 02:58:22	@ChrisCarlinSNY @sal_licata Just flipped ya on, big guy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-26 06:35:53	@MelissaStetten I think both can be accomplished simultaneously. See, one's a TV show and the other is cookies. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-26 14:30:24	@FredBrooklyn I thought Fezzie was still tied to a hospital bed.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-24 00:10:53	@BMonzoWFAN What's moronic was Pineda thought hisbdark skin would hide it. IT WAS ON HIS NECK!!!! It shouldn't be banned but he's a dunce.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-24 00:11:24	@RealPaigeWWE Lol, now you have to.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-26 22:44:21	@kobebryant Nobody should. You can't say it, but fuck that guy. Total douchbag.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-26 22:45:51	@shockthemonkee Doesn't everyone?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-27 00:58:04	Fucking Christ. The wife is making me watch the fucking Breakfast Club. Please send a sniper. 1 shot through my neck. Quick and painless.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-24 02:04:46	@PatFuckinDuffy Idiotic doesn't begin to explain it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-24 03:12:43	@JonHeymanCBS But he'll continue to use plenty of "dirt and sweat".
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-24 03:13:42	@BMonzoWFAN Welcome to the "look at me" generation.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-26 03:09:43	@BeavisCumia But I can see both your hands....err...paws.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-24 11:19:50	@CarmodyDenis @Buster_ESPN YOU'RE.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-28 12:45:55	@JimNorton Is this why you're growing out your hair? Congrats.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-27 17:44:11	@DrBootyLunch No. Thank god I was able to change it and watch something less terrible.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-27 22:31:15	@shockthemonkee Some guy named Lamar or Leroy is my guess.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-27 22:32:13	@JoeandEvan Jeez, they're really having trouble selling tickets, huh? 
#TotalSarcasm
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-24 18:35:36	@NekoCase The wrestler or the musician?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-24 20:31:00	@tonyiommi That album was the last vinyl LP I ever bought. Great album.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-28 23:39:11	@BleacherReport Kind of lame. Why be ashamed of a Heat jersey? Even symbolically, it's pretty stupid.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-29 00:17:23	@RobbyTheBrain A promo where he hardly speaks and he's still amazing.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-29 00:27:57	@JoeandEvan My wife and son couldn't watch it, lol. Said it was too creepy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-29 00:46:14	@erockradio I'd you get a pic of you with that sign, you'll get $100.00 sent from my PayPal.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-28 06:39:04	@sjcrain Can you give a link to some type of back story for this? Love from Jersey.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-28 06:43:36	@sjcrain :) Read the article from last night, just didn't know what precipitated it. Come back to Jersey with @murderbydeath Best show ever.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-28 06:44:03	@sjcrain Thank you.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-29 18:20:56	@shockthemonkee And he's swinging it around like a boss.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-30 20:28:13	@PatFuckinDuffy Good for you guys. Tell her to unblock me. Did ya ever get a chance to check out Murder By Death?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-01 19:15:30	@HEELZiggler It must've hurt when you jumped off the rope and your leg crumpled.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-02 01:06:57	@artiequitter It looks like somebody already puked on them for ya.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-04-30 10:51:23	@DRUDGE_REPORT Then it wasn't really botched, was it? Should just use a bolt gun they way they kill cattle.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-01 01:40:27	@AnthonyCumia Hwy, is that Tom Skerritt?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-01 02:33:31	@jdharm He needs to be put in a trash compactor.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-02 12:17:55	@CodyRhodesWWE Any plans on bring back the 'stash?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-02 23:15:48	@JoeandEvan Urging fans to dress a certain way is for shitty teams that need motivation. Small market mentality.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-03 02:51:33	@notsam This guy is just a cranky old man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-04 22:31:14	@aubreysitterson If (big if) the rumors are true, we might be getting a live Smackdown mid-week. Would be awesome.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-04 22:34:06	@sethgutt Right by West Front Street?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-05 02:14:21	What are those characters that are on the display tonight? Firemen? Riot police? And why? #WWEExtremeRules
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-03 00:09:00	@shockthemonkee awesome tune.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-03 00:34:15	@TheOnlySherrod I see what ya did there......
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-03 23:54:17	@RacistFrancesa No, they're coming to us. http://t.co/Uk3XHUUqS6
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-04 00:38:31	@RacistFrancesa Construction paper and popsicle sticks need the ponies.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-06 00:46:35	@aubreysitterson I'm waiting for them to "un-unify" the top 2 belts. My son asked a question last night. If its one title, why have 2 belts?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-06 21:15:11	@RacistFrancesa A good deal of them look like they already got hit in the face with a shovel.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-06 22:45:45	@TheOnlySherrod Congrats. My little guy is a 3 stripe blue belt. Red is just around the corner.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-07 00:53:44	@notsam Had to pretend that my allergies were killin me when my son asked, "what's wrong?" Stupid feelings.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 12:37:16	@THENYGENERAL Not bad but ask her to bend over and get in the light a bit more.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 12:38:49	@OPIEANTHONY1 Agree about the preshow but the main show is the same length it's always been, you dope. Always been 4 hours.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 12:48:12	@OPIEANTHONY1 No. Only sometimes. The 10-11 hour was always contractually best of.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 13:09:01	@THENYGENERAL My job entails me going into bars every day. You can't believe the amount of drunks out there. But a gym? Jeez.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 14:22:25	@THENYGENERAL I used to get stoned on the way to the gym, but drinking is another story.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 14:25:05	@TyBentli No, just annoyed that you host a shitty morning show and can't come up with anything original. #Hack
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 14:27:00	@LinzBella Lucky. It's raining like god's peeing on me or sumptin. He drank too much or sumptin. Tsss tsss
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 14:30:25	@BeavisCumia Shouldn't that pic be hashtagged #WhimEmWednesday?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 14:38:06	@THENYGENERAL It helped me with working out. Would get so paranoid, I would just concentrate on what I was doing instead of loafing around.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 14:49:27	@THENYGENERAL That's when the hot shower would rule.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-06 18:44:36	@EastSideDave Did I just see you turn off of New Bedford Road onto Rt 195? Almost like seeing a chupacabra. Sweet!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-07 04:04:34	@JimNorton Jesus, you really like self heating soup, huh?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-07 04:14:26	@SlipperyPete10 How do you know such things?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-07 04:21:40	@SlipperyPete10 First, he's posted a bunch if pics with the soup. Second, he shaved it again. Look at pics from today's show. So there. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-07 04:25:19	@SlipperyPete10 Yeah, when Louie CK was in yesterday, he was freshly shorn. I think he just really loves that soup.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-07 04:29:38	@SlipperyPete10 Half asleep on the couch with my dog snoring next to me. Fucker is loud.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 17:30:50	@BeavisCumia Ugly man-ape?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 17:55:04	@BeavisCumia Please don't. Fuckin hilarious, Beav.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 17:56:14	@JennyJohnsonHi5 Holy. Fucking. Shit.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 18:01:21	@Deadspin The Browns are fucking idiots. Why are they paying their talent evaluation staff? I'll tell ya why, because they're dopes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 18:46:35	@bcgoldthwait Are you gonna be on @RonandFezSXM ? Last time was a blast.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-07 16:21:34	@LinzBella Hopefully in a very revealing outfit. ;)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-07 16:23:13	@LinzBella That'll work. Weeeee!!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 22:23:31	@LadySandersfarm No. She should be under a truck.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-07 17:15:37	@FredBrooklyn Please tell me that's real.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-07 17:17:15	@FredBrooklyn Good. I almost felt bad for a second for laughing so damn much about it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-07 17:45:38	@kevinpollak Kevin, I'm always on the lookout for a good bowl of fuck. Where can I get one?  Or two perhaps?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-07 17:46:44	@RacistFrancesa Not good, great, ok?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-08 23:21:18	@shockthemonkee Now you're fuckin talking.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-09 23:44:20	@rolandos99 If it has the name McDonald's attached to it, it will be shitty.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-09 23:45:31	@FredBrooklyn @iamcolinquinn That's what I find myself wondering every time I read his tweets.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-09 23:49:25	@AnthonyCumia I knew there was something shifty about those dudes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-12 07:06:19	@RacistFrancesa Same here, Fatboy. I've been falling asleep then waking up at 1230 the last three weeks. Wide awake until 5 usually.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-12 07:07:12	@LinzBella Join the club. #InsomniacsUnite
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-10 23:32:39	@MichelleDBeadle He's a total scumbag. Fuck 'em.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-11 01:29:00	@erockradio Hey prankster, what was the name of the beer you said tasted like fruity pebbles? Awesome week last week, BTW.  :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-14 01:55:40	@PatFuckinDuffy Happy birthday, Pat.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-14 02:01:29	@AnthonyCumia @Anon4justice Hey dope, when cops shoot, it is ONLY to kill. That's how EVERY COP IS TRAINED.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-14 02:02:12	@RichVos Is she cleaning up your mess?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-11 02:03:59	@erockradio Thanks, E to the Rock.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-14 03:04:45	@Anon4justice @AnthonyCumia Can't disagree with you there. But they are trained that if they need to shoot, shoot to kill.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-13 00:25:34	@RobbyTheBrain The question is why would they think it would work in the first place?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-13 00:27:39	@RobbyTheBrain Smokin hot.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-13 00:32:41	@shockthemonkee She will be. In time. Jay Z is smart enough not to get his hands dirty.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-11 13:25:06	@JonHeymanCBS Unfortunately Jon, we all know exactly why. :(
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-14 13:50:45	@OandAshow That was the gayest tweet ever. Really? You can't wait to hear what they think? #KindaMoLike
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-15 14:12:05	@OandAshow Then fuck that flabby bitch.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-15 14:12:22	@OandAshow That just means more time for Oscar.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-16 11:59:20	@NekoCase No I won't. But I will be pretty damn swell. #MarryMeNeko
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-16 12:01:07	@OandAshow Fucking EWWWW!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-18 17:12:25	@erockradio Not a fan of the hard ciders.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-17 04:40:20	@erockradio How'd you like it? Going to see it tomorrow afternoon. Did you see it in 3d? IMAX? #GuyWhoAsksTooManyQuestions
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-17 23:23:14	@TheOnlySherrod You don't even need the sane part. Just a TNA fan in general is a rare thing these days.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-18 12:41:26	@joerogan Thought the beginning was kind of aliw bit it got waaaay better.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-19 12:55:30	@Alsboringtweets I'm sure your family would be thrilled.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-20 02:04:22	@AnthonyCumia You forgot to shoot it in portrait mode.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-21 00:55:10	@LinzBella BOOM!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-22 23:19:40	@989thebuzz So are white middle aged straight men the only people allowed to be made fun of anymore? Your spinelessness is sickening.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-22 23:45:25	@shockthemonkee I got soooo drunk one time, I puked so hard I gave myself hemorrhoids.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-21 12:49:25	@RacistFrancesa For Christ's sake, how am I supposed to drive with this boner?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-21 22:59:35	@LinzBella Boobs? I love 'em too. Derpa derp.......
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-24 03:23:35	@TheIBang Holy fucking fuck. I don't think I've ever seen a movie like this before. I feel dirty. #CheapThrills
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-24 13:10:36	@FredBrooklyn A damn shame.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-22 14:42:23	@OpieRadio By now they've probably installed a new board &amp; knocked down a wall or 2. You'll come back to a new palace/studio. LoveYaMissYa
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-22 18:49:35	@OpieRadio Gonna be droppin mud soon for the Good ol' Opster.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-22 19:51:54	@Alsboringtweets Anyone that uses "them there" in any context gets an automatic favorite.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-24 14:40:41	@iamcolinquinn That's not very nice, sir. In fact, it's downright haughty.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-24 14:42:57	@LinzBella No you don't. I'm not a fan.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-24 14:50:43	@HowardStern Paterson, NJ? Is anyone surprised? Fucking animals, and I am speaking about the ones that walk on two legs.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-22 21:14:31	@shockthemonkee One of the craziest shows I ever saw was Biohazard w/ Onyx at the Academy in NYC around 92-93. Good times.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-24 17:15:37	@LinzBella He's done this for years. He acts like a fucking psycho douche, then gets upset when people call him a fucking psycho douche.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-23 22:21:55	@kriztufer mmmmm lobster....
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-23 22:22:36	Rainbow over Woodbridge, NJ. http://t.co/lJPXcMSK2G
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-24 00:56:00	@ApologyGirl21 No firearms ID?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-24 02:58:51	@TheIBang Watching Cheap Thrills. Christ, this movie is wacked out.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-28 01:09:48	@THENYGENERAL Every time he speaks, he contradicts what he said earlier. Typical talking head that just let's words fall out of his mouth.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-28 01:41:54	@cc660 You can't. Well, you can but Hank let up 4 goals tonight. Give him a rest tonight.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-26 01:36:44	@erockradio Never tried those, but they make a root beer float flavored soft chips ahoy. They're fantastic.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-28 02:19:54	@MichelleDBeadle Plenty of places.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-28 02:34:30	@TheOnlySherrod How was the Ziggler/Zayn match? The interwebs said it was awesome.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-28 02:45:50	@Joelsherman1 The way he's been yapping, I'm surprised he's not on all three tonight somehow.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-26 12:31:04	@Jay_HorwitzPR Wow. Hideous.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-26 16:07:58	@TheOnlySherrod It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood and later on, the then song to pee week's playhouse.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-26 19:18:16	@BeavisCumia Shame? Never heard of such a thing.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-26 15:40:11	@HEELZiggler yeah, it takes a special kind of talent to fuck on camera.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-26 16:02:43	@cc660 You gotsta trim them brows, man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-26 19:17:43	@IAmJericho Reminds me of Super Dave Osborne.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-27 00:09:05	@RobbyTheBrain Is it just me or is Hunter's shtick getting old?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-27 00:52:21	@JimNorton You shouldn't be surprised anymore, Jim. It's just the way it is. Not that you're wrong by being disgusted, but if people con't..
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-27 00:53:43	@JimNorton didn't lap it up like horses at a lake, the media wouldn't be as sleazy as they most certainly seem to be.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-27 00:54:55	@RobbyTheBrain But just like Roman Reigns, no mic skills.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-27 15:25:39	@LinzBella Hate to be a prick, but shouldn't it be #we'redoomed ? ;)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-27 12:14:28	@BMonzoWFAN Coming from the same people that lauded Rivera for his retirement tour.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-27 19:49:03	@TheOnlySherrod You used the wrong word, man. The one you wanted is "effects".
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-27 19:51:28	@TheOnlySherrod No biggie, it'll be easier to spot. :) What kind of seats you got?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-27 20:30:35	@TheOnlySherrod Cool. Very good chance we will see that sign.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-27 20:32:15	@TheOnlySherrod Lol. Don't be silly, the internet never bashes anything. ;)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-27 23:00:28	@TheOnlySherrod Damn man, great seats!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-27 23:07:16	@THENYGENERAL Simply awesome. The uke cover of War Ensemble was pretty rad also.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-27 23:12:28	@JoeandEvan Can ownership really be that clueless, or do they not care? Something really fishy about this situation.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-28 19:23:46	@Alsboringtweets It worked pretty well for him, until he tried his hand at robbery and kidnappings. Stick to killing, Juice!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-28 19:28:01	@LinzBella Then I wish you could open carry also. ;)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-27 18:32:28	@RonandFezSXM Looks like he's a big fan of wearing high heels.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-28 20:04:32	@JimNorton Pretaped?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-28 23:43:11	@CAITLYNHALEY_ Maybe that is their hobby.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-28 23:44:06	@christenmerrick Maybe people aren't trying to silence you. Are they only allowed to respond if you agree with them? Just asking.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-28 23:55:34	@CAITLYNHALEY_ Possibly, but it doesn't mean negative reactions are wrong just because you disagree with them.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-28 23:59:38	@CAITLYNHALEY_ Agreed, but at the same time, twitter is a public forum. You shouldn't be surprised. There are assholes in life everywhere.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-29 00:01:58	@_katienoel_ Its the internet. If I tweet my opinions on Play Dough, I'd be met with negativity.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-31 00:59:15	@shockthemonkee Hot as fuck.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-31 01:00:26	@CMPunk Did ya make the trek to LA tonight?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-31 13:33:01	@BeavisCumia True story? Who are the pitchers today?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-31 13:35:25	@TheOnlySherrod Morning.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-31 21:39:23	@NekoCase Fuck til ya drop.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-31 21:40:15	@NekoCase Oh, you meant the 'shrooms. Lol, Nevermind.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-31 23:08:59	@RobbyTheBrain Nope. It's Sammy Zayn.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-30 02:15:02	@MikeFrancesaNY Mammoth size DC in ya hand?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-30 18:52:48	@CAITLYNHALEY_ Switch to mid eighties hair metal.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-30 02:51:14	@CMPunk Just waitin for those Hawks, my friend.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-05-30 21:30:25	@shockthemonkee I'm sorry to hear that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-01 17:27:26	@aubreysitterson Considering he'll be watching a hockey game, I doubt he'll be there. But I wish he shows up.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-01 21:58:39	Karate tournament this weekend. Little dude won both his matches! #Undefeated9YearOld!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-01 23:42:30	@RobbyTheBrain Like I told my son earlier today, he's doneski.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-01 23:54:06	At this point, shouldn't it be 4MB? #WWEPayback
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-02 01:32:40	@erockradio Not on my 360 feed. She said that DB should quit just like CM Punk did when the crowd started chanting his name.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-05 01:26:16	@ClassicShelb No, its when Knoblauch missed the throw to 1st &amp; beaned him in the head while Zimmer was in the dugout. http://t.co/8Tuae5mU6x
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-05 02:10:53	@AnthonyCumia @MrNailsin Is that an Ed Grimly haircut on Ant? http://t.co/rPNF10dVO9
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-05 02:11:48	@JimNorton Tell us more about this "show" that involves talking, Jim.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-05 02:48:30	@HEELZiggler Damn, Dolph. Great seats.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-04 01:56:29	@AnthonyCumia Do u have to check your piece or can you bring it in with you?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-04 01:58:14	@ToolPusciferAPC Was at this show. Good one, but not even on the same level as the Radio City Music Hall show.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-05 12:49:28	@PatFuckinDuffy I was too busy wearing camo shorts with long johns on underneath and 10 hole Doc Martens. #GrungeMo
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-04 17:51:13	@murderbydeath Come back to Jersey soon. Pretty please.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-05 00:26:06	@THENYGENERAL Doc's the real deal. Loves the game and is a great announcer.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-05 00:34:45	@THENYGENERAL Oh god no. He's not nearly that bad. Buck is like listening to an emotionless Frankenstein. Doc at least speaks with feeling.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-05 00:35:58	@iamcolinquinn Stop with the threats, Quinn. It's crass and unbecoming of a man such as you.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-06 11:58:24	@FredBrooklyn I like my idea for a name. Ugly flatnose animal.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-06 11:59:49	@FredBrooklyn Time to start registering your knives.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-06 12:01:00	Pushing out a sideways football is not my idea of a good start to the day. #NeedMoreFiber
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-06 13:13:57	@OpieRadio I would rather miss 1 day a week for the summer than a 2 week chunk in July. You guys deserve it. Drop some hammers for me.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-06 13:19:45	@THENYGENERAL Total quay move.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-07 13:18:06	@JRsBBQ Fuck that. You just worry about you right now, JR. We'll take care of the numbers my friend.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-07 13:19:17	@Alsboringtweets I drive the TP down to Trenton every morning. Scared shitless every day.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-07 13:20:33	@FredBrooklyn I have a word with 2 of the same letters in the middle of it. Clue: It's not nagger.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-08 00:30:35	@FredBrooklyn Been vaping for just over a year. Absolutely love it. Get yourself a Kanger ProTank 3. Best tank I've had so far.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-09 14:55:00	@travistefft Is that Dice? Love the white mutton chops and black hair.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-08 01:24:21	@FredBrooklyn The flavors are limitless. Got me some delicious Bavarian creme right now.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-08 01:25:38	@AnthonyCumia @dasachtach1 @timbrennan1200 Isn't she the reason your shit got set on fire?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-06 19:09:00	@notsam @erockradio So glad u guys got the studio upgrades you really needed. So now the studio has died twice in a few months. #FixItDammit
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-08 03:04:27	@7BOOMERESIASON Everyone did.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-08 03:04:46	@7BOOMERESIASON Except, of course, the refs.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-08 03:06:29	@CMPunk @BaileyLAKings  Too bad the Rangers don't have some lame-o mascot you could ask the same question.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-07 01:46:52	@PatFuckinDuffy The back of his neck must smell like the Fulton Fish Market.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-09 22:58:27	@AnthonyCumia @AgathaC80 What about that psycho that stabbed two little children? Are you gonna stop people from cutting their steaks now?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-09 23:13:12	@RobbyTheBrain Fuck yeah, man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-08 20:30:34	@erockradio Cool. Heading to Shop Rite at the moment. Will pick some up. Thanks, E.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-10 01:50:03	@BMonzoWFAN Not good. Not good at all.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-10 01:51:55	@RobbyTheBrain Too bad it's also with Orton, DelRio, and Sheamus.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-10 02:59:44	@iamcolinquinn You turning into L Ron Hubbard? Next you're gonna tell us to hold metal rods and you'll be able to tell what we're thinking.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-10 03:04:34	@JimNorton How's that stuff work? That don't make no sense.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-10 11:43:41	@THENYGENERAL @MiracleWhip Anything with that shit in it is automatically disgusting.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-10 11:44:30	@Alsboringtweets I like that "unpress to unmute". For some reason, it made me chuckle.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-09 00:27:06	@travistefft What did you think about his hissy fit after getting tagged out going to third? Guy is kind of a whiney brat.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-11 19:51:11	@WWEAJLee Heck yeah. Did you see the trailer for the new Star Wars Battlefront game? Insane. http://t.co/YiZTDXrvxn
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-12 00:54:17	@LinzBella You've gotta try a product called Biscoff's cookie spread!!! It tastes like spreadable Nilla wafers. http://t.co/fsTQUDirUv
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-12 01:00:11	@BeavisCumia Lol, good boy. Sperl it for everyone. No, seriously, please do. I love it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-12 02:24:42	@AFROandFriends I don't do this nearly enough to peeps but thank you for all ya do.  :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-12 16:16:17	@HowardStern How many plastic surgeries ago was that?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-12 16:42:06	@RealMichaelKay Obi Wan Kenobi: "That's not a moon, it's a young boy's head!"
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-12 03:29:26	@FredBrooklyn Did you write this? https://t.co/JMyYSd8Sh8
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-10 17:52:59	@Zellyanks Until it's done. I'm a glutinous pig.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-10 18:22:00	@Buster_ESPN The main difference is that the ball is supposed to be thrown towards the plate, not the bat into the field.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-10 18:22:38	@Buster_ESPN I thought the pitcher only got a fine.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-10 19:16:12	@LinzBella Then just wait. There's no rush. Once you find something you HAVE to have, then go for it. Bad idea gettin ink just to get it. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-12 21:52:51	@BeavisCumia @ShitCunter I think your tweaking his nipples. Or cheering him on.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-12 21:53:13	@BeavisCumia @ShitCunter *you're
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-11 02:42:48	@AnthonyCumia @AgathaC80 @OANDAFANBOY If they're legal gun owners, most likely yes, they do.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-13 20:07:27	@LinzBella Time to reach into your panties and dole out some justice.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-13 20:10:01	@LinzBella I keed. I keed. http://t.co/EUfY2Rrqbr
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-14 00:11:56	@BeavisCumia The apple don't fall too far, does it Beav?

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-14 02:57:29	@CanadianBdog Those Mo's thought they were going to Medieval Times tonight.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-14 03:25:25	@JoeandEvan Wow, that's bold.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-14 15:01:00	@Just_Jenny__ Lol, my wife's 39, she did the same.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-14 17:14:39	@NekoCase Car 54 Al Lewis, Munsters Al Lewis or crazy old man Al Lewis?  http://t.co/HXzrlQs94v
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-14 12:44:00	@pennjillette Pics or it didn't happen. ;)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-14 13:02:58	@FredBrooklyn When the fuck did people start using the term "toy boy"?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-14 13:03:46	@OpieRadio It's a, it's a stand alone flag. (Awkward silence)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-14 13:38:20	@Just_Jenny__ My wife and son saw it yesterday. They said the same thing. And then proceeded to spoil it for me.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-15 22:59:42	@AFROandFriends Locked and loaded, my friend.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-15 23:27:10	@sabbathfans Animalize was the best album of their non makeup years, IMO.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-15 23:50:31	@sabbathfans Don't like the re-recordings of older songs.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-15 23:56:41	@sabbathfans Trust me, they definitely re-recorded and also remastered some tracks on it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-16 00:03:44	@sabbathfans Even when it came out, as a young lad, I knew they sounded yucky to me. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-16 00:05:16	@sabbathfans While KISS is one of my all time faces, they are the KINGS of doctoring. From Alive! on, they've done it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-16 00:05:54	@sabbathfans faves. Damn new phone autocorrect
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-16 00:06:24	@sabbathfans Sadly since Destroyer.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-16 00:39:42	@sabbathfans My first KISS tour.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-16 00:49:01	@sabbathfans Would have lived to see that huge kiss sign in person.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-16 00:49:07	@sabbathfans Loved
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-16 02:12:23	@AFROandFriends It's not like you didn't give peeps ample time.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-16 02:13:27	@ClassicShelb @TacoBell Make them being back the Zesty Steak Melt. Late 90's offering was fantastic.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-14 20:30:21	@Ankh_Warrior Dear lord, I had that shirt!! Bought it at the old rt 1 flea market.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-14 23:55:59	@AnthonyCumia Hey Ant, have you watched the History Channel's World Wars documentary yet? 6 parts. Fantastic.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-15 00:39:55	@GreggAndJoeShow @AnthonyCumia We watched all six parts last Sunday. I couldn't stop, it was so good.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-15 00:42:19	@GreggAndJoeShow @AnthonyCumia Lol, the old ads? What about the new ones? They're pretty good in a pinch too.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-16 23:12:57	@aubreysitterson Not even a little bit. He looked utterly terrified.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 01:19:04	@BeavisCumia Exactly. Both get girls gooey.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 01:31:35	@NekoCase You have a new fan for life. http://t.co/5zIGKppSuq
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 14:24:11	@EastSideDave It looks like you're shitting on that desk.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 14:25:33	@PatFuckinDuffy Such as? DM if ya don't want it out in public view.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 14:26:12	@JimNorton @notsam A poor (real poor) man's Jay Leno.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 14:28:43	@murderbydeath Crikey guys, get out to NJ!!!!!! BTW, loved the WFPK After Dark interview.

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 14:35:43	@FredBrooklyn Or to be in an attic running wires.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 14:36:27	@RottenStench Bullshit. The white pants make it so much more fun.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 15:11:13	@THENYGENERAL Big white bald cop deserves a bullet to his skull.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 15:18:28	@THENYGENERAL Once a suspect is down, they should be slapping the cuffs on him. Otherwise, it's a gang beating.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 15:20:28	Noodles digs Sabbath. http://t.co/9E6hLcYTcc
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 15:28:47	@THENYGENERAL Unreal. Was the scumbag fired?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 15:30:10	@JimNorton How in gods green earth are you a bigot? Maybe another word ending in "got" but not bigot.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 15:33:58	@THENYGENERAL How does that even happen?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 16:23:54	@Fizzygrrl I'm sure some were girls when nobody was looking. ;)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 16:30:49	@Chipsmuddah Maybe. He was hilarious on @OandAshow yesterday. Maybe you don't like him because he isn't the same skin color as Lamar.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 16:33:42	@FredBrooklyn The Washington small pox blanket wearers.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 16:47:37	@jdharm I am so hoping she gets the remainder of her teeth knocked out.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-17 13:16:03	@THENYGENERAL @OpieRadio don't forget that after all of that, they get up as if nothing was wrong and walk around completely fine.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 22:37:53	Just came back from @cheesecake . Delicious. I ate like I have three assholes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 22:39:08	@JerrySeinfeld Who ya got on this season?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-16 17:46:31	@aubreysitterson Plus, 20-22 years ago, they were always playing shows with other metal bands. Jeez, they've been around a long time.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-17 21:52:29	@OpieRadio @AnthonyCumia @DanSoder Who's "The Man" now?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 01:36:20	@sabbathfans Absolutely hated it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-19 14:28:46	@JoeandEvan Hold off on the Mets until 12:55.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-18 01:42:48	@sabbathfans I really wanted to like it, just wasn't my cup of tea.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-19 11:15:33	@popup82 Yet your profile pic is of a drawing. #HowConvenient
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-19 11:16:37	@THENYGENERAL Always thought it was chop.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-19 11:24:16	@THENYGENERAL The bane of my existence.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-19 15:56:11	@popup82 Point is, you're coming off like a douche. Is that good enough for you? @LinzBella
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-19 16:05:44	@popup82 @LinzBella Calling someone a jokerface, yet you hide your own face. Hence, ergo, ie: douche. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-19 16:13:58	@popup82  Big difference. I'm not commenting on other peoples looks.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-21 02:53:03	Great Yankees win!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-20 11:45:15	@BeavisCumia @ChiSoxFanDan But she'll need/want more attention than you get, Beav.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-19 20:07:40	@LinzBella A Stern fan? Didn't know there were any left. #WiggedAssholeSucksAnyways
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-20 22:48:08	@AnthonyCumia You got rid of the Mustang?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-21 14:21:13	@Alsboringtweets Yet it was what the radios guys call "an instant classic". Strange, huh?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-21 15:09:43	@Alsboringtweets Wish there was a "tolerate us on Facebook" option.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-22 05:11:12	@pennjillette Just finished watching #TimsVermeer . Fantastic film, and a fascinating story. Thanks, man!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-22 14:35:44	@PatFuckinDuffy Jesus, dude. Go grab some aloe or something.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-22 15:19:08	@WFAN660 Listening to #OldTimersDay pregame. What a lovely Sunday!!!! Always get a bit emotional.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-23 22:57:38	@sabbathfans Relax, all right? My old man is a television repairman, he's got this ultimate set of tools. I can fix it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-23 23:00:51	@ToolPusciferAPC Never seen that one. When's it from?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-22 17:57:01	@erockradio K.I.D.S. Kids Incorporated!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-20 11:51:15	@LinzBella Just remember that a rest day is just as important as a work out day.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-23 00:30:25	@NickHamelinMLB He looks like a half baseball player/half chef.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-23 03:22:16	@AFROandFriends gmail cool I'm guessing?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-23 03:24:18	@ChangSucks @PaulMcCoy_ @caduceuscellars What store? In central Jersey here.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-23 03:25:12	@AFROandFriends Nevermind. Checked site, I'm a dumbass.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-23 03:36:15	@ChangSucks Coolio. Thanks man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-25 23:35:23	@erockradio You're right, just like Fruity Pebbles. Good call! http://t.co/uPPvC0oJ2s

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-29 15:51:45	@bertkreischer Sorry to hear that, man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-28 20:25:41	@PatFuckinDuffy Then you're in the wrong place.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-29 23:41:26	@FredBrooklyn Jesus, Fred. And I thought I was bad. What juices are you using?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-29 23:42:37	@artiequitter Liar. Everyone knows you can't read.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-30 00:49:41	Anyone else completely sick of the Adam Rose gimmick? So damn lame. #MITB
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-30 00:54:06	@TheOnlySherrod Sad, isn't it?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-30 01:26:01	Wow, how lame of an ending could that have been? #MITB
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-30 01:37:21	@RobbyTheBrain Don't mind Rollins winning at all, but the finish was shitty. There was no need for Kane.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-29 03:47:57	@TheBethPhoenix Oh my!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-30 23:53:37	@FredBrooklyn He's a fucking joke and finally the large majority of America is starting to see that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 00:22:13	@OneNationRadio It's Jericho.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 00:27:04	@HeymanHustle Agree 1,000,000%!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 00:36:50	@OneNationRadio I was sure it was gonna be Flair, but I'm SUPER STOKED that it's Jericho!!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 00:50:45	For the first time in a LONG time, my son and I were rooting for Swagger and Colter.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 01:31:19	@RobbyTheBrain The both of them are a complete waste of TV time.

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 01:47:12	Wow, #WWE doing ads for alcoholic beverages? Kinda strange considering that it's a PG product they're trying to sell
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 01:58:47	@PatFuckinDuffy Oh jeez, what did he do now?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 02:02:56	@sethgutt I can't believe it! Why waste such a tease on him?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 02:03:28	@sethgutt Honestly thought it would be Flair or Jericho. :(
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 02:04:01	@sethgutt YEAH BABY!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 02:04:44	NOW THATS AWESOME!!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 02:06:48	@aubreysitterson This time I agree with you! He is most certainly over like rover.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 02:18:11	@kingsthings If you think he looks 50, you need new glasses, Larry. Lifelong Yankee fan here, but you're insane.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 02:38:49	@Coreyt7383 You're right. He looked 65.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 02:40:33	@Coreyt7383 Exactly. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 02:41:08	@RobbyTheBrain Hell fucking yeah!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 02:43:19	@sethgutt I think the failure of Paige has more to do with the lack of competition than with her own shortcomings.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 02:44:56	Punk can't be too far behind....... Hopefully.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 02:49:16	@sethgutt Possibly.But now we'll be able to see a good fued in the Divas div., as opposed to the reality tv crap they've been throwing at us
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 02:56:51	@kriztufer True but for them to have totally sanitized it the last couple years and then come out with an ad like that is kinda weird.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 02:57:16	@kriztufer The little dude has gotten pops totally roped into it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 02:58:48	@kriztufer No doubt about it. Noodles couldn't care less. http://t.co/SI1M0apzzh
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-30 13:48:50	@FredBrooklyn You seem to understand it perfectly, Fred.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-30 14:19:19	@iamcolinquinn Why do I continue to follow you? http://t.co/cv4eKaad0V
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-30 14:59:44	@FredBrooklyn And here I thought it was my sweaty feet causing that smell.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 11:55:24	@Buster_ESPN Wow, kid is kind of a dick.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 13:22:21	@OandAshow She looks like Gollum with a wig.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 18:04:43	@RobbyTheBrain She's a fucking dope.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 20:43:52	@JerrySeinfeld Favorite 70's cop show?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-02 00:12:28	@GrovelingUSA @detroitnews It's not like their city has any real problems or anything.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 21:58:28	@GZRMusic In extra time, is it sudden death, or do they play the full :30?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-01 21:59:09	@aubreysitterson Just asked that same question myself.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-29 23:53:39	@FredBrooklyn even in Central jersey, there are quite a few. Best so far are vixen vapors online though.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-29 23:54:22	@FredBrooklyn There's a local place around here that has a killer Bavarian creme. Goddamn its yummy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-30 08:53:39	@OneNationRadio Orton can't carry shit.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-30 18:41:05	@AFROandFriends Yay!! Thanks man!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-02 04:01:08	@iluvdogshit @AFROandFriends Would love to get a link if that's cool.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-30 20:56:55	@PatFuckinDuffy No, its super easy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-30 20:58:09	@sethgutt Gotta be Flair.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-30 20:59:18	@sethgutt Besides, HHH wouldn't tease a return by the Miz.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-30 14:11:03	@HEELZiggler The @WWEUniverse as well as my whole family was cheering for ya. Good showing, no matter who won.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-06-30 14:46:12	@FredBrooklyn Wow, what a Fucking surprise.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-02 11:43:22	@AnthonyCumia Serious question, are you allowed to tell her you're carrying and you'll plug her or is that against NYC laws?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-02 11:44:48	@FredBrooklyn Aw, poor Lil' Beavis.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-02 11:49:26	@IAmJericho Makes you feel real safe, eh?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 03:55:45	@ItsStarmanda @AnthonyCumia So she's blackmailing him as well as punching him about the head? Not cool.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 03:58:32	@MeghanMcCain Now those are some heels.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 03:59:55	@BeavisCumia December 25. A feline baby Jesus.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 04:08:25	Wow, Nancy Grace is on Arsenio. What a dumpy little troll.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 18:41:30	BBQ time at my aunt's. Time to eat like I have three assholes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 00:21:24	@JimNorton @anthonycumia I'm sure we'll all find out soon enough. Have you, Ant and @OpieRadio spoken yes?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 00:21:47	@JimNorton @anthonycumia @OpieRadio yet. I'm an ass.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 00:22:09	@MsMarinaMonroe That'll work just fine.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 00:22:48	@MsMarinaMonroe Only see one in that pic.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 00:23:44	@MsMarinaMonroe Weird. I only see a black one.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 00:25:05	@fredrogers75 Checked on the PC. Phone is only showing the black one. Black is beautiful. In this case anyway. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 12:00:53	@skinnygeezus @AnthonyCumia Why? Because someone acted less than human? Wowza.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 12:01:51	@DRUDGE_REPORT Yet nobody else in the world is.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 14:12:30	@BeavisCumia Do you have good mic technique? It's time to step up, Beav.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 14:46:59	@THENYGENERAL Have fun, man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 14:01:48	@FredBrooklyn @AnthonyCumia @girllovesports No Fred. Its BLACK, not white. Anything black can't be racist, remember?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 14:27:57	@BeavisCumia Is it 1987 agan?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 13:05:45	@PatFuckinDuffy Seriously Pat? How so?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 13:06:31	@MsMarinaMonroe Have fun! Is your friend @LinzBella going also? ;)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 15:53:07	@BeavisCumia I'm sure the Jag has some nice leather to chew on, Beavis.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 16:18:50	Just finished listening to the new @TalkIsJericho with Rob Halford. Amazing as always!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 17:24:50	@BeavisCumia You guys gonna pop on tonight?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 17:52:38	@notsam Thoughts on the events from the last 24 hours?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 18:05:39	@AFROandFriends Call them. Make them waive the fee.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 18:18:08	@SuperSix8 @EpicSciencePorn @NekoCase Like Zack Dela Rocha said, "anger is a gift."
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 19:09:43	@Whodattis And how can you disagree with that? Are you trying to say all cultures are as advanced as others?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 19:13:16	@Whodattis Sorry you feel that way, but it's true.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 19:14:59	@Whodattis @vjp3 Actually yes. He has cited @BIGMOMMAPRODS as one of the most profound men he's ever meet as well as one of the funniest.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 20:04:22	@BeavisCumia Looks like you need some fiber in your diet, Beav.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 18:19:59	@LinzBella What happened?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 18:32:02	@LinzBella Unreal. Yet another cunt comes out of the woodwork to pile on.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-02 17:18:50	@AnthonyCumia I asked before, but you may not have seen, are you allowed to say, " I'm armed, leave me alone or I'll shoot you!"?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 23:22:55	@tanakh99 Sorry man, but you're dead wrong on this.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 20:59:49	@BeavisCumia Will change it once I get to my PC. Any luck having pops give me a reprieve? Already signed the petition.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 21:00:27	@JoeandEvan Just saw a commercial on TV for it in Jersey.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 21:58:16	@FredBrooklyn @boboxm103nyc siting at 2:00!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 22:13:54	@BeavisCumia Did he go in with his burger again?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 22:54:11	@AFROandFriends Damn man. You got lucky.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 22:55:49	@Sethrogen Jesus fucking Christ! http://t.co/Z8jVaNOHpi
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 23:05:57	@SlipperyPete10 You naughty little minx! http://t.co/jPLlXBF0CM
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 23:45:49	@TammyPescatelli Remember, you're allowed to think what you want as long as everyone else agrees with it. How sad.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 23:56:22	@AnthonyCumia You mean he let you take his pic?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 00:47:11	@MikeFrancesaNY Everything's easier to swallow as long as ya have enough DC.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 01:06:47	@JRsBBQ Listened to your chat with @RondaRousey this afternoon to get ready for the match tonight! Thanks, JR!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 01:15:28	What's with showing the weigh ins from yesterday right now? #UFC175
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 02:11:35	@CMPunk @joerogan Don't we all?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 02:36:44	Noodles ain't hearin it. http://t.co/LlsOg5kY7o
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 02:38:35	@CMPunk Seems like he'll be ok. Better that he takes a pass for tonight.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 16:20:22	@BeavisCumia You still have your claws. If that walking garbade dump shows up, have at it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-02 18:23:36	@JimNorton Oooohhhh!!!! That's crass.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-02 19:27:13	@sabbathfans Sabotage. Hands down, no question.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 03:42:27	Wow. Dana looked a bit pissed about @joerogan asking Rousey to fight again in August.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 03:43:10	Wow. Dana looked a bit pissed about @joerogan asking Rousey to fight again in August. #UFC175
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 17:38:50	@arosskat Driving 5 minutes to see @iamcolinquinn is crazy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-05 17:58:24	@Whodattis @TammyPescatelli No. He calls people that act like animals and savages animals and savages. Do some research.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 14:41:53	@Zellyanks Only everyone.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 15:48:35	I got a bad feeling about this. http://t.co/pPrELBJ1Ej
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 03:44:16	@JimNorton Thought you'd be out there in Vegas tonight, you sexy devil.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-02 22:10:19	@JimNorton It was beautiful and vomit inducing at the same time.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-02 22:10:42	@JimNorton There ain't no doubt.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-02 22:12:09	@RandomDonk @JimNorton Fill my ass with cock grout.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-02 22:20:23	@RandomDonk @JimNorton And if you scream, I'll jam my prick in your snout.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-02 22:55:26	@OpieRadio I refuse to hear that song on purpose anymore. Was stuck in my head for hours. Pistachio-io-io. Jesus, make it stop!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 18:42:52	@AnthonyCumia You're an idiot.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 18:43:09	@AnthonyCumia shit, not you Anthony.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 18:44:25	@AnthonyCumia I was responding to that cretin you had retweeted
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 18:46:50	@Justin_Wind @AlyssaRosenberg @AnthonyCumia unbelievable.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 18:48:45	@THENYGENERAL they are basically assholes who do not need to get a real job.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 18:51:47	@Celichi I just hope that he doesn't block me for an honest mistake. It has been a rough 24 hours for the poor guy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 19:07:23	Someone please let @AnthonyCumia know that comment was not meant for him.  I was calling the nignog an idiot. FUUUUUUCCCCCKKKK!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 19:37:20	@Celichi I can see his tweets if I go to his profile page.It says I'm not following him. Says failed to follow when I try to follow him now.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 19:41:53	@BeavisCumia Please let your pops know I didn't mean to call him an idiot. It was supposed to be directed towards someone giving him shit.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 20:08:16	@MsMarinaMonroe If that is looking nervous, please keep looking nervous. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 20:10:30	@MsMarinaMonroe anyway, good luck with everything today.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 20:15:03	@FredBrooklyn You outside today Fred? Spent the first half of the day in an attic running cables. Fucking hot.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 17:15:27	@FredBrooklyn You find out how he got there yet?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 14:06:53	@TheOnlySherrod coolio
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 14:58:17	@boboxm103nyc Were there a lot of peeps there, Daniel?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 15:01:13	@Alsboringtweets So an L.T.? Did it come with an underage hooker?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 15:05:15	@LinzBella To whom are you referring to? Hmmmm?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 15:07:47	@LinzBella Yes, I have my theories. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 16:51:43	@Anthonyennis3 No shit, really?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 00:36:19	I voted for Jimmy to win Last Comic Standing's #ComicComeback. Vote now and watch Thursdays at 10/9c! #comiccomebackjimmy
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 20:22:01	@FredBrooklyn hopefully this long weekend will give us some other news that will take the heat off.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 20:23:05	@FredBrooklyn Yet the bobble head Reverend Al still has a show on television.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 20:24:00	@FredBrooklyn finally back in my cold vehicle. But the damage is done, I'm soaked.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 20:26:02	@JimNorton Done.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 20:46:22	@FredBrooklyn The problem is it is a slow news day apparently.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 20:49:25	@phargus335 That's no zilch sir, that's a national treasure. Albeit a chinless national treasure.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-03 21:08:52	@BeavisCumia @CATHCO9 No, he is a genius in all facets of life. #HailBeavis
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 17:21:35	@JosephCumia @Tino_Dis Don't worry, Joe. Almost every single one of this cunt's tweets involve @OandAshow in some way. He can't get enough.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 17:22:37	@THENYGENERAL @cb74745 Silly boy, you know blacks can't be racist. It's impossible.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 17:26:05	@THENYGENERAL @cb74745 Exactly. http://t.co/fRc7EbnoDC
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 17:28:38	@cb74745 @THENYGENERAL Wow, you sure schooled us. #WayToGo #KeepItUp #SoScaredOfYourBrilliance
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 17:30:12	@cb74745 @THENYGENERAL U's folks? Is that even English? #ScarySmart #MakesSoMuchSense #GoBackToSchoolRetard
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 17:37:32	@cb74745 @thenygeneral So much hate. Did you learn that in the hood? Your bio mentions you have 2 kids, no mention of a husband though. Sad.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 17:40:47	@cb74745 @THENYGENERAL And what's a deweller anyway? Again, go back to school. #KThanksBye
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 17:49:06	@cb74745 @THENYGENERAL Lol, you think fixing your shitty spelling makes you look tougher? Fix the dead buffalo on your head first.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 17:54:10	@OpieRadio Next Monday? Holy Toledo. Good luck, Op.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 17:54:48	@OpieRadio Fucker got me again!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 00:01:12	Wife and kid out of town for the next couple days! Party time. That is if party time=doing laundry, drinking beer and watching the Yankees.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 20:23:01	@neontaster Looks like his website has been locked down as well. Goddamn pussy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 20:27:10	RT @OpiesV: Nothing says "journalist" like a locked twitter account. That means you, @AeksNotAlex
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 20:45:44	@steveyknight Is that episode 124?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 00:33:52	@BeavisCumia Better be careful, Beav. Next thing, the NYP will be putting you on their site. "Racist, Misogynistic Cat Says Naughty Things!"
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 19:05:14	@AFROandFriends They just don't fucking learn.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 19:06:06	@discordianslip @SIRIUSXM @BeavisCumia As soon as I get a sharpie, you'll get one. Or fifteen.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 19:07:51	@Jelani64 @THENYGENERAL @AnthonyCumia Most likely just a hooker with a little something "extra".
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 02:37:54	@BeavisCumia As long as your paws can't operate a camera, you'll be fine.  Plus, you're orange, not caucasian.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 02:41:04	The night is just getting started. The Summer Wheat was on the recommendation of @erockradio .  #TheConsumer http://t.co/87NASMloaN
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 21:54:38	@BeavisCumia Sounds good to me, Beav. #StandWithAnt
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 22:21:52	@MentalityMag I took this pic of him trying to conduct a meeting between Opie, Anthony &amp; Jimmy. http://t.co/ZyyQx8otUV
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 22:22:54	@AFROandFriends Fools are gonna roon it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 22:23:58	@jvkeboxhero Him and his lady friends have literally talked each other's ears off.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 22:24:31	@JoeandEvan Lol. Good luck with that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 22:31:17	@neontaster Good idea. That's how I got blocked by @AnthonyCumia the other day. Called someone giving him shit an idiot. Tagged him instead.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 22:31:57	@JoeandEvan Lol, at first I thought that high top table was a butter churn.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 02:42:04	@MaxwellPower11 @JimNorton Did ya tell her to shut up and smack her with yer pecka? Well, you should've.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 02:43:29	@BeavisCumia  But Beav, orange is the new black. Or so the say. Send a salami to your boy in the army...
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 02:45:21	@boboxm103nyc That's only because she was able to get away from you for a little while.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 02:51:38	@aforesto06 If I say I'm black, is it ok? Even though I'm whiter than a sheet of toilet paper.

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 03:02:47	@aubreysitterson What about wearing a monacle?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 03:11:09	Oh Fireball, you've got me in your clutches once again, you sneaky bastard.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-04 03:15:49	See @BeavisCumia , even Noodles listens to your dad. And yes, Noodles is a faggot. http://t.co/IATaS9hcFJ
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 23:13:50	I'm not sure I ever posted the finished (for now) version. http://t.co/MRD3atures
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-06 23:37:45	@BeavisCumia See, I told ya I'd change my av when I got to my PC. #StandWithAnt
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 20:17:20	@JosephCumia Listened as soon as it was posted yesterday. @pennjillette Is one of the greatest minds our time.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 02:07:40	@FredBrooklyn Looks like an old, bald vagina.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 21:00:47	@THENYGENERAL that would be great. A live, on air death of a fat slug
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 21:28:36	@FredBrooklyn Truly made me loff and loff.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 21:50:57	@shelivesart Are you insane? Girls make fun of other girls way more than guys do, and they're much harsher as well.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 22:17:26	@AckertNYDN @SteveGilbertMLB Big Mike just spit up a mouthful of DC.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 11:17:09	@aubreysitterson On the replay later in the show, they mentioned both Finlay and Noble.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 11:27:22	@THENYGENERAL Infamous, butcher. Angel of death!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 11:43:29	@THENYGENERAL Love the fact that entire album is under 30 minutes long. Brutal from beginning to end.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 11:44:32	@THENYGENERAL Holy fuckaroni. Just realized the last time I saw them live was 20 years ago. Jesus Christ.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 11:48:27	@LinzBella I knew my theory was correct.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 11:50:34	@MentalityMag Sonofabitch! You basketball trick shot-ed me!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 11:51:45	@THENYGENERAL Truth
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 11:56:23	@LinzBella Indeed.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 12:03:20	@LinzBella And you see it exactly how it is. I have it on GREAT authority that one REALLY hates the other.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 12:18:31	@LinzBella Mind if I DM?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 00:11:59	@JimNorton Agreed. I love you guys more than you know. Really gay, but my work day usually revolves around listening to you. Hate change.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 00:13:14	@JimNorton No matter what happens, you three have made me laugh more than any 3 people ever have, and I'm a real miserable fuck.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 00:14:21	@BeavisCumia @chipchipper206 Lol, where d'ya think he got the pic, Beav?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 16:03:58	@BeavisCumia I follow everyone I can. Your pops still got me on Block Island. :( #ImANeedyFuck
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 17:55:42	@NekoCase How's this? Noodles loves Neko! http://t.co/Iv41rldgWb
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 18:12:00	@RacistFrancesa Mike, please calm down, next thing you know if you will be clutching your chest.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 18:43:50	@AFROandFriends Sad that you even have to do that. Its not like you haven't said it 1,000 times already.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 18:55:27	@BeavisCumia Seems that way, Beav. Noodles thinks it's bullshit. http://t.co/Q6iOfw2TtQ
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 11:08:08	@AFROandFriends Seriously? Goddammit
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-07 11:42:05	@THENYGENERAL They're just gonna have to deal with it for now.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 19:38:44	@FredBrooklyn As they should. They've been too nice for far too long.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 01:41:23	Hey @BeavisCumia , just for goofs. Put in a good word for me.  
#StandWithAnt http://t.co/bcw0EV3Aaa
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 20:17:16	@neontaster Good. Too bad it wasn't more than 5.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 20:22:25	@rvitale68 @beaviscumia Great article. Love the last line, "Sirius needs him more than he needs them." Ain't that the fucking truth.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 20:23:22	@neontaster Foolish monkeys with clubs thinking they are above everything and everyone.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 20:25:03	@THENYGENERAL @FredBrooklyn See, now you're a racist too for pointing out crimes that actually happen.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 02:51:04	@BeavisCumia Fuck that cat. A real man writes it on his own nutsack. Upside down. In marker.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 03:17:52	@KurtInPhilly @BeavisCumia Not fair. You can't see the barrel pressed up against her back. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 20:32:05	@THENYGENERAL @FredBrooklyn Sue you. Sue everybody! #MyShoesFellOff
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 21:43:15	@LinzBella What happened?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 21:49:28	@LinzBella Jeebus. Alternate heat and ice every two minutes for about an hour.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 21:49:37	@LinzBella ten not two
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 22:45:18	@neontaster Still, too nice.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 22:50:40	@rham1222 @Buster_ESPN I care. It makes me wam and fuzzy inside.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 23:55:43	@OpieRadio Fucker!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-08 23:56:03	@OpieRadio Stop tricking me, it's making me feel dumb!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-09 01:49:52	@JoeandEvan Either that bat is really small or you're a giant!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-09 01:57:54	@kingsthings @DonRickles How big is his cock?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-09 02:15:55	@MentalityMag Why not? My first hand job in times square came from a dude dressed like a chick anyway.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-09 02:16:49	@MentalityMag I only found out about it halfway through. I swear, I was young and stupid.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-09 02:24:29	@MentalityMag @SteveFromPhilly That's the thing, not many have which is why it was so strange that Sirius cut ties so quickly.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-09 14:51:26	I love doing work in the ghetto. Trenton needs to be carpet bombed. http://t.co/vs04mzoXFr
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-09 17:13:06	@JoeandEvan Is that Mick Foley's house?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-09 20:07:52	@LinzBella @Gawker And people look at them as an actual bastion of journalistic integrity. Unreal.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-09 20:09:49	@LinzBella @Gawker @queenelisabeth She should demand the immediate firing of Hudson Hongo.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-09 20:14:40	@neontaster @PzFeed And his buddies can't find his feet or head anywhere either. Coincidence?

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 03:04:56	@LinzBella Saw that yesterday, someone retweeted it.  "Look at me, but don't say anything I might not like"
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 03:07:43	@LinzBella "I'm leaving twitter, but you can catch me on any other social media platform. Look at me please!!!!"
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 03:09:47	@LinzBella "Like a new inner tube."
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 03:19:52	@MIKEBOCCHETTI @OandAPests @OpieRadio @JimNorton @AnthonyCumia Yeah, what he said!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 03:28:27	@LinzBella Lol, before I could fave that last one...poof, it was gone.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 03:30:13	@LinzBella Let's drink, kiss girls and show our asses! What substance.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 03:34:09	@LinzBella Why? There's no boobies there and anyone can see a cootah for free on the internet.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 03:36:13	@LinzBella Never underestimate the stupidity of humans.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 03:59:34	@SIRIUSXM @OandAPests @HowardStern @sternshow @shalomshuli No one gives a shit, which is why you had to resort to posting it online for free
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-09 23:37:49	@queenelisabeth @LinzBella @Gawker Fantastic question.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-09 23:49:10	@kingsthings Its a generalization, Larry. Are you playing stupid, or are you really that dense?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 00:00:44	@MaggieBarks2u @OandAPests Noodles agrees, but he's too busy listening to music to respond himself. http://t.co/tSHDnsooF3
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 00:08:33	@queenelisabeth @LinzBella @Gawker Too nice. I like how he is trying to rationalize his article in the comments section. What a journalist.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 01:30:47	@neontaster @BeavisCumia @TheRed_Show "Now that's a name I've not heard in a long time. A long time..." http://t.co/a3MO82fVVT
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 01:39:14	@LinzBella Which one? There's a lot around lately.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 01:41:15	@LinzBella Just another asshole whose mommy didn't live him enough.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 01:42:14	@LinzBella Love. Goddamn new phone. Damn autocorrect is still learning my typing.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 01:42:52	@LinzBella As will most of the internet.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 01:43:16	@LinzBella Later, tator.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 02:58:44	@FredBrooklyn At least he's got rosey cheeks.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 14:55:51	@RealGilbert Might as well just start apologizing now.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 16:46:15	@OandAPests Fucking Christ man. That's nasty.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 16:48:19	@LinzBella Why not? And what were you planning on anyway?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 17:00:17	@queenelisabeth Blech......

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 12:09:52	@THENYGENERAL @FredBrooklyn He's been completely nuetered. I'd actually be surprised if he gave his opinion on it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 12:10:31	@THENYGENERAL @FredBrooklyn The fatso Reverend Al clipped his balls off years ago.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 12:14:18	@THENYGENERAL @FredBrooklyn I'm sure he'd like to, but he's being watched closer than a 10 year old at a NAMBLA convention
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 12:18:41	@THENYGENERAL @FredBrooklyn Just remember the skin color and you'll know why he gets a free pass.

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 18:27:56	@thriveQUEEN @LinzBella Stay home, don't work, and further the perception that your community is  absolute garbage.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 18:31:19	@thriveQUEEN @LinzBella No, actually you are wrong. But that's not much of a surprise, is it?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 18:35:13	@thriveQUEEN Good idea. But be careful, there's way more black savages roaming the streets with illegal guns.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 18:37:03	@thriveQUEEN @LinzBella Lol, written by the Journal of blacks in higher education. No, that's not a slanted opinion.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 18:41:08	@thriveQUEEN If you're trying to tell me that illegal gun shootings are outnumbered by school shootings, you really are a fucking idiot.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 18:48:30	@thriveQUEEN Both, stupid.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 18:49:31	@thriveQUEEN @LinzBella Yup. And I didn't need the taxpayers to foot the bill either. Yay!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 18:50:07	@thriveQUEEN @LinzBella Says the idiot who's fighting a losing battle.

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 18:08:09	@FredBrooklyn Lolol, don't be ridiculous.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 03:01:20	@BeavisCumia @AnthonyCumia That nig.....um night sky looks amazing.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 04:33:39	@OandAPests Sorry, but Danny was and is an obnoxious prick.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-12 10:59:31	@BeavisCumia Let your pops know he was great on Red eye this morning. Weird, they actually let him tell his story. How odd.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 19:49:33	@LinzBella @queenelisabeth @Johoff23 Him and Jim were blindsided by this also. Tryin to make the best of a shit situation.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 20:14:51	1 monster shot of Jagermeister on an empty stomach.  Weeee!!!!!!! All I've had today is one cup of coffee.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-12 12:02:06	@THENYGENERAL Aww he just wants a friend.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-12 12:10:31	@DiabloBlanco76 @THENYGENERAL Spot me, bro!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-12 12:11:05	@THENYGENERAL Now is the time you want to have noxious farts. Let er rip.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-12 13:28:19	@LinzBella Lol. Jesus.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 05:40:35	@redheadtart But you look like a retarded 12 year old. Who should care what you say?
@MsMarinaMonroe
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 05:41:46	@redheadtart Besides, @MsMarinaMonroe is sexy. You're just a troll who wishes people wanted her as much as Linz.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 05:47:28	@BeavisCumia My bitchy wife. Want to slam my head through a wall.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 05:58:22	@TheOnlySherrod Sleep tight
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 06:24:56	Jesus, Tanya Tucker really sucked a dick.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 20:43:39	@yankeys92 @OandAPests I wouldn't know. Uninstalled and cancelled the other day. #FuckSiriusXM

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 23:27:34	@THENYGENERAL A real trooper. Watched it Saturday night and could help squirming.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-10 23:30:44	@boboxm103nyc @JimNorton Bobo, that's illegal. Plus, Jim isn't the murdering type.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 00:28:15	@TheOnlySherrod Actually, an egg on a burger is pretty damn tasty. Sounds nasty but it's good.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 00:30:28	@TheOnlySherrod First time I tried it, I thought I was gonna hate it. Ended up loving it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 00:40:52	Even after being married for almost 15 years, my wife still wonders why the can of Reddi Whip is always watery. #BestHighEver
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 00:47:49	@JonB_954 Hilarious, but I'm sure there were plenty of white-faced baby hangers wearing that same shirt. Look behind it. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 00:57:12	@THENYGENERAL Ah, the real deal.  Had one years ago.  Could get about three and a half cartridges into that thang. #LikeFlyingThroughSpace
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 00:58:58	@THENYGENERAL Ever got one of those frozen cartridges stuck to the inside of your mouth/lip? Not fun.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 01:00:37	@THENYGENERAL I'm down to just one glass piece and an Iolite vaporizer. Can't have the little dude finding my shit.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 01:03:27	@THENYGENERAL Had a friend who saw the Dead. Came into school with his face all fucked up.  Fell down the concrete steps of Giants Stadium.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 01:05:41	@THENYGENERAL Turns out, dumbass did a huge balloon in the last row and decided he needed to run down the steps. So many crazy N2O stories.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 01:11:30	@THENYGENERAL No doubt. If they could figure out a way to make that last a couple hours, I'd never puff or drink again.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 01:16:00	@THENYGENERAL I've unfortunately NEVER had a dentist offer it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 01:20:43	@THENYGENERAL Yeah, the place I go to is lame, except for the hygienist with huge knockers. They always hit my arm and I think she likes it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 01:29:53	.@NekoCase and @hoganhere could poop on a plate and I'd like it.  Hilarious, ladies. Hits too close to home though. https://t.co/ZHU1FIX5Ot

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-11 01:56:49	@ImRyanBeck @JosephCumia Looks like @EllisMate might want to think about getting some individually placed follicles placed artistically.

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 17:12:35	@Shartblaster @freightfrogger Why? It is unfortunate that @SiriusXM killed a great show. He'd be right.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 17:14:38	@Insomniacint He's a fucking idiot.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 17:16:04	@OrbaniDiana @turkfeb Yeah, cuz everyone was really believing it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 17:18:12	@Insomniacint Didn't read a verbatim quote, but I'm pretty sure Bubba stood by his side.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 18:31:02	@nolarmade @OandAPests Chicanery and tomfoolery. Perhaps some shenanigans as well. #StandWithAnt

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 19:04:16	@BeavisCumia Did you hang out with Grandpa the other night? He seems pretty lonely. And drunk. @JosephCumiaSr
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 20:23:59	@RobbyTheBrain Its twitter. What did you expect, a fanclub?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 20:34:40	@RobbyTheBrain Sorry, but that's gimmick infringement. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 20:42:42	@iShatInYourBag gets it. @RobbyTheBrain
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 20:47:36	@RobbyTheBrain @iShatInYourBag Fan or not, he's right. You know I agree with a lot of what you say, just not this, that's all. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 20:48:53	@arnold_ziffel @OandAPests @EdwardTheDstryr Let's just say syndication underground is alive and well and keep it at that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 20:54:48	@iShatInYourBag @RobbyTheBrain Lol, then just block him if you dislike him so much. Seems silly to pay attention to someone you dislike.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 20:56:06	@Booper702 @AnthonyCumia @MotherShuck @jgramuk Of course. You're just not allowed to be racist towards the black ones.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 20:58:48	@iShatInYourBag @RobbyTheBrain Lol, what a way to spend your time. So sad.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 21:01:34	@iShatInYourBag @RobbyTheBrain I call it down the middle. I don't follow his hater account. Got better things to do with my time.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 21:03:33	@iShatInYourBag @RobbyTheBrain Can't do anything about the virginity thing, that's long gone, but she can ride my face anytime.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 21:39:28	@SGirner There's nothing creepier than a German smiling. Nothing on earth.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 00:42:42	@RobbyTheBrain Nah, they're too old.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 00:50:21	@LinzBella What, no selfie in your underwear with a bottle of whiskey?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 00:52:01	@sethgutt No. Rose stinks and his gimmick is old worn out already. Santino, even as a comedy gimmick lasted.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 00:59:37	@LinzBella @KingWOHisCrown They sure as hell are!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 01:00:03	@GreatWrestling It sure is. :)

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 22:31:25	@BeavisCumia Get the app. Free week. No cc needed. And it lasts WAY longer than a week. Just sayin'.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 22:33:10	@iShatInYourBag @RobbyTheBrain So what? You sure you don't want his dick or something? You seem awfully interested in what it's up to.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 22:34:45	@BeavisCumia @StPaulBrandon Nope.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 22:36:05	@BeavisCumia @StPaulBrandon All ya need is an email address, phone number and zip code.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 22:37:37	@BeavisCumia Sorry, Beav. You're wrong on this. Trust me, I stopped giving those cunts @SiriusXM my money ago.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 22:38:06	@BeavisCumia This is for the phone app, BTW. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 22:45:52	@iShatInYourBag @RobbyTheBrain And you know this how? You seem really interested in the sex life of someone on the internet. Too interested.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 22:49:05	@MentalityMag They realize all the flopping was for nothing.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 22:50:39	Goddamn, this shit is yummy. http://t.co/TYBIcYgs10
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 22:52:14	@BeavisCumia Don't even need to go on a comp. Can do it all from the app on your phone when you download it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 22:53:15	@iShatInYourBag @RobbyTheBrain Blah blah blah, you're starting to get boring.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 22:58:23	@BeavisCumia Here, right from the app. http://t.co/gSaIX0tgrS They email you a code and that's all ya need.

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 23:07:34	@BeavisCumia Anytime Beavis. These idiots @SiriusXM are a bunch of fucking.....um...idiots. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 23:26:42	@OpieRadio The big question is, will there be a reunion tour after you're no longer in the mood for a melody?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 23:28:53	@BeavisCumia Lol. Sneaky but ultimately stupid.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 23:32:27	@BeavisCumia I haven't given them my money since they took @Troyquan off the air. I will GLADLY pay your pops for an audio/video 'cast.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 23:42:28	@notsam Does the show run until 11 tomorrow?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-12 23:50:13	At the bar, last song we heard was Baby Blue by Badfinger. All I could think of was poor Walter White lying in a pool of blood.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 00:46:45	@BeavisCumia It's already pretty lopsided, Beav.  :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 00:54:24	Motherfucking Fireball, you got me in your clutches YET AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 23:44:48	@BeavisCumia Now you're talkin', Beav. #BeavisUberAlles
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 23:52:43	@OpieRadio Sadly is a bit of an understatement, Op.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-14 00:16:37	@ShawnLott12 @Shartblaster Don't worry, by Wednesday, that'll change.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-14 00:17:53	@RobbyTheBrain I RT'd. You've got me intrigued.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-14 00:18:33	@kingsthings Really deep thoughts there, Lar'.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-14 00:52:58	@RobbyTheBrain Sure am, Brain.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 01:06:34	@myMotorhead 's album 1916 fucking rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-13 01:23:08	@JosephCumiaSr He sure has, you drunken sot.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-14 04:42:15	@FredBrooklyn Let's hope so.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 11:58:16	@WFAN660 A good amount of people way smarter than I am feel that would increase arm problems in pitchers. Not gonna happen.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 12:14:00	@Zellyanks Notice before, Craig didn't know that Spielberg pic was from the early 90's? He's infuriating.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 12:15:16	@THENYGENERAL @LionelMedia @AnthonyCumia Like Ant said, a community of animals and savages.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 12:22:01	@Zellyanks @cc660 He comes off as a clueless hack sometimes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 16:39:38	@TammyPescatelli @Tino_Dis He's just a troll, nothing more. And he's not even a good one. Pretty boring.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 16:49:15	@Tino_Dis @TammyPescatelli She used him for promotion, so what?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 16:50:57	@Tino_Dis @TammyPescatelli And you're an unfunny twitter troll. At least she gets paid for it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 16:55:16	@Tino_Dis @TammyPescatelli But that's the thing, no one gives a fuck what you think.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 16:59:13	@Tino_Dis @TammyPescatelli Really? Poof....you're gone.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 18:35:39	@redban Big deal, the Samsung Galaxy S5 is a better phone anyway. Apple has taken a step back in the land of smartphones.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 21:52:03	@JennyJohnsonHi5 Guess you didn't see the director's cut.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 22:33:20	@AFROandFriends I hope you've shitcanned them. Fucking idiots.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 00:22:22	@BeavisCumia Guess it was that pic I (and hundreds of others) favorited.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 00:23:12	@JoeandEvan Seriously? They're usually on top of things like that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 01:08:47	I'd like to strangle Ken Rosenthal with that stupid fucking bowtie. #AllStarGame
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 01:14:04	@BeavisCumia No. You'll point and make fun of me. http://t.co/548SPjSQQ1

255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 01:05:19	@OpieRadio @RichVos He was one of your all time great guests, Op. Was loffing and loffing the whole time. Awesome show today, man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 01:19:08	@discordianslip Still, she can kick some ass at least.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 01:37:12	@infosecnj The mere fact that they are urging their residents "not to flee" from future strikes tells you all you need to know.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 01:52:06	@MentalityMag Unfortunately, that's about all she's good at.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 12:24:02	@queenelisabeth What if my profile pic is a big pecka or sumptin? #JesusThatWasLame #ISuck
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 14:34:24	@rurriolaolarte @RobbyTheBrain Not happening.......yet. They're just getting ready for Brock to come back for the Summer Slam build up.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 15:13:11	@Celichi Why should he? @RealDLHughley comes off as nothing more than an apologist for horrid behavior.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 14:40:32	@rurriolaolarte @RobbyTheBrain Personally, I'd shit myself. Would love it. Sadly it doesn't seem to be happening anytime soon.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 15:17:47	@BellaTwins Noodles approves. http://t.co/OOwFYBBpT7
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 21:42:44	@JimNorton Apparently the one in his mind that really doesn't exist.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 22:04:20	@ExPoleDancer Almost as entertaining as Steven Spielberg sitting against a dead triceratops.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-14 19:07:01	@Tino_Dis @JosephCumia @OandAshow Still can't get off their dicks I see. How sad.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-14 19:10:47	@Tino_Dis @JosephCumia @OandAshow Ya mean he actually had a live show today? Lemme guess, talked about how his beard doesn't want fame?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-14 19:11:18	@Tino_Dis @JosephCumia @OandAshow Or how he wears scarves in the middle of summer to hide his turkey neck? How riveting.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-14 19:14:59	@Tino_Dis @JosephCumia @OandAshow Silly twat. Hero's? It's a radio show, dummy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-14 20:03:33	@NekoCase It'd be better for the world if someone found him without a head in a bathtub.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-14 20:08:41	@SIRIUSXM You suck.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-16 18:14:49	@BeavisCumia Cuz they're not there. Them blacks are afraid of water.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-14 22:15:21	@HowardStern No one cares, and you know it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-14 23:22:20	@LinzBella Lol, is she serious?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 00:03:21	@LinzBella No one is very surprised, are they?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 00:04:42	@OpieRadio Is the full version available still? Great show today. Strange, but great.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 00:08:03	@TheOnlySherrod Hells yeah!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 00:12:46	@LinzBella Lol!!! He might like it, ya never know.....
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 00:16:40	@RobbyTheBrain 44 minutes until your big reveal!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 00:17:27	@OneNationRadio Just like the musical Cats, now and forever.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-15 00:23:56	@travistefft Haven't ESPN gotten the hint, he's the worst part about the #HomeRunDerby
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-17 12:17:29	@queenelisabeth You should have pulled your pants down and sprayed piss all over him while hissing the entire time.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-18 00:00:48	@OneNationRadio My nine year old son could beat Eva.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-18 01:36:20	@Insomniacint Wouldn't be that bad if a thing, would it,?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-18 01:52:35	@JimNorton Damn good podcast with @joerogan !! What's the next one you're on out there while in Cali and when?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-17 11:49:58	@TheCumiaShow Can't wait. Why can't people love both shows? Its double the fun!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-17 14:25:45	@bones5411 @SIRIUSXM @HowardStern Meanwhile, he stayed at NBC when she got fired. I think he actually believes his own bullshit.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-17 14:34:41	@neontaster What did you think of Transformers Prime? Just finished watching it last night. I loved it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-17 14:40:49	@neontaster In the last few days,  I watched all three seasons of Transformers Prime, thought it was fantastic. Animation &amp; story was great
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-18 12:21:06	@ExPoleDancer Obummer would rather crack jokes about policy and finances while Putin flexes his ever-growing muscles.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-18 12:22:52	@Sharks3376 @ExPoleDancer He's not gonna be playing, he will be world leader soon.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-18 16:51:17	@opieandanthony @SIRIUSXM Correction-there are much better music sources for NO money.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-18 17:26:21	@chelseagrunwald  But Hamas is a "political group",  at least that's what @Max_Fisher is trying to tell us. Is he blind, stupid or both?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-19 11:55:48	@LinzBella Not yes. Hell yes!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-19 12:00:41	@op_thedestroyer Maybe I'm selfish,  but I like the idea of more shows for us to listen to.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-17 23:36:37	@LinzBella Absolutely LOVE IT!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-20 22:06:01	@ExPoleDancer Tell me about it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-20 23:57:13	@OneNationRadio No idea why they had Cameron win.  Very lame.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-20 23:58:15	@TheOnlySherrod Agreed but usually they have one pre-show match that is somewhat decent.  Both of them completely sucked.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-20 23:58:37	@DEVrockstarr He just wishes he had her legs.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-20 18:35:06	@The_Gipsy_Queen @liquid_aluminum @OandAPests It's spelled they're, you dope.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-20 23:37:37	@OneNationRadio Good seats!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-20 23:48:21	@OneNationRadio Sweet.  Pre show was a bit of a squash, huh?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-20 23:52:39	Let's go Naomi!  #WWEBattleground
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-20 23:56:17	@TheOnlySherrod You'd think they could have one decent pre-show match instead of two completely lame ones.  #WWEBattleground
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 00:13:06	@TheOnlySherrod Pretty quick.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 00:22:33	They've more than  made up for the two shitty pre-show matches.  This one is killer! #WWEBattleground #UsosVsWyatts
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 00:29:19	@OneNationRadio Damn good match.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 00:30:04	@sethgutt I'm still not sold on them being champions.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 00:44:12	@OneNationRadio Yeah but Charlotte should be in the men's division.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 00:47:35	@aubreysitterson There's a couple ways someone could reverse it.  Cool move but very beatable.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 00:48:18	@OneNationRadio Not getting the whole "I'm not sure I want to beat you" vibe that Paige had.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 00:59:42	@THEONLYSHERROD My wife said the same exact thing.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 01:23:20	@RobbyTheBrain Not sure.  He seems to love it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 01:23:40	@RobbyTheBrain He wasn't going anywhere without it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 02:17:53	@TheOnlySherrod @HEELZiggler should've won.  Miz stinks.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 02:20:26	@RobbyTheBrain He's not being buried.  He made it to the final two. The company knows he's a crowd fave, but he always comes up just short.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 02:21:52	@RobbyTheBrain Anyway,  @HEELZiggler is my favorite on the roster.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 02:22:43	@neontaster His dick is too strong to be held in by mere pants.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 02:23:35	@TheOnlySherrod IMO @HEELZiggler is the best worker on the roster.  He more than deserves a title.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-18 19:29:23	@AFROandFriends thanks man. Feel better.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-20 00:51:34	@AFROandFriends As much as I do love and use your site, I have to agree 1,000%.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 16:08:58	@The_Gipsy_Queen Maybe being a twat wasn't the best idea.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 13:58:55	@FredBrooklyn What's wrong? Haven't listened yet today.  Running cables through a crawlspace.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-21 14:01:44	@FredBrooklyn 'nuff said. Lemme guess, he's talking about his desire for dick yet again?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-19 01:18:29	@BeavisCumia You little bastard! I've been watching it spin for over an hour now and it's all your fault!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-22 01:03:09	@RobbyTheBrain He's the best talker in a long, long time.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-22 01:20:46	@RobbyTheBrain Can't stand the Miz and his overly large, fake choppers.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-22 01:22:37	@RobbyTheBrain And they knew as soon as it was booked that they fucked up.  Don't worry, he'll never get back to that spot again.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-22 01:28:39	@ExPoleDancer Strange how such a Christian(muslim) man could ignore such things.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-22 01:59:34	@notsam Sam, you know better than that.  He's not singing a goddamn thing.  Jesus, this is bad.  #Raw
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-22 02:06:59	@Zellyanks If they're giving Timo and O'Neil a plaque, then most certainly he gets a monument.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-22 02:26:13	@JBLsDragon I luuuuvvvee yeeeewww!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-22 02:27:04	@RobbyTheBrain Just as long as they don't keep making Big E talk like MLK.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-22 02:27:50	Christ, we had our monthly dose of Khali last night.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-22 02:28:48	@TheOnlySherrod Poor oaf can barely even walk to the ring anymore.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-22 11:22:21	@FredBrooklyn Oh Christ.  Is it as bad as DeRosa was yesterday?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-22 11:24:27	@TheOnlySherrod 'Morning
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-23 14:03:05	@THENYGENERAL @OpieRadio If they decided to add someone full time to the show, @DanSoder would be my choice.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-22 21:50:39	@neontaster You may unfortunately be right.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-23 04:03:51	@Zellyanks At least I can go to sleep now.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-22 14:33:06	My view from the job site today.  Did I mention I hate working in the ghetto? http://t.co/huyjfvmuSF
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-23 19:54:32	@AFROandFriends I was just going to ask what you think it might be from.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-22 20:06:37	@FredBrooklyn @op_thedestroyer @TheCumiaShow Same for me.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-23 14:52:07	@JimNorton Just finished part 1 of your @VICE show. Fantastic job.  When should we expect part 2?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-23 15:49:16	@TammyPescatelli You are always a great listen on @RonandFezSXM.  Can't wait, Tammy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-24 14:12:36	@HEELZiggler Was it cold in the room when you took that photo?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 00:33:38	@FredBrooklyn Not too much of a fan of these guys.  I have the shows that I like and I don't have time for more.  Except for one.  #080414
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 00:34:37	@FredBrooklyn Misery loves company.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 00:35:02	@FredBrooklyn Who's the 12 year old on the right?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 00:54:10	@boboxm103ny @OandAPests @AnthonyCumia Bobo, you're the best.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 19:52:17	@aubreysitterson What happened? Did someone say a wrestler was Over Like Rover?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 22:18:41	@sarahmcpants @MrMooncricket @BadBeavis Oh, God forbid I voice my displeasure with something. I'm sure you've never done that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 22:22:39	@MrMooncricket I don't like that you have to individually go through each person you follow to turn on notifications for the stock app.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 22:27:25	@ChrisJohnHanna @TammyPescatelli @DanSoder @RonandFezSXM They were the best part of this past week!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 22:31:50	@TammyPescatelli @ChrisJohnHanna @DanSoder @RonandFezSXM So did all the listeners, Tammy!!  Hilarious!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 22:34:11	@sarahmcpants Good day, Ms. McPants.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 01:32:05	@BadBeavis Now now.  Remember, cool and collected.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 23:35:25	@FredBrooklyn Got one of these bad boys today. So far, I love it!  http://t.co/zVtIx3esxU
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 23:39:41	@FredBrooklyn I was down to my last 1300mah battery. Needed a new one.  This guy's got a built in 2600mah in it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 23:40:38	@FredBrooklyn Plus, it uses the same charger as my phone (micro usb). And I can charge other things off of it directly.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 23:48:25	@FredBrooklyn lol.  I wish.  Just happy I have a new gadget.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 01:00:01	@MentalityMag But I guarantee by this time tomorrow night while he's at Nana's, I'll be full of beer and fireball. And hopefully half naked.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 01:31:24	@FredBrooklyn Wish he'd just jump out that 37th floor window.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 03:25:30	@FredBrooklyn And they kicked some serious ass with it as well.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 03:27:42	@GrovelingUSA Everyone that @KeithOlbermann has worked with in the past already knows he's a cunt. @kirkmin
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 04:43:12	@fredrogers75 @kriztufer Started with Emmerdale, played all albums through and just finished Grand Turismo. Still got more. @theninapersson
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 05:14:26	@TheOnlySherrod Looks like a cross between Diddy and Don Cheadle.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 23:10:14	@ExPoleDancer Lol, was just on the app.  Crip-walking into the theater like a boss. Fuck dem lines.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-27 01:57:35	@erockradio Agreed.  But at least Guardians Of The Galaxy opens next weekend.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 16:31:19	@RonandFezSXM He looks so damn sad.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 17:57:56	@rolandos99 @notsam Try me.  What happened?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 18:24:07	@BadBeavis I couldn't care less if you pissed of Anthony, but for Christ's sake, stop with the gifs!!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 18:27:00	@BadBeavis No, I don't. It sucks and most Twitter apps still don't support gifs.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 18:28:33	@sethgutt That's about as good an answer as you could hope for I guess.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 18:34:16	@sarahmcpants @BadBeavis If Twitter could make a mobile app that didn't suck, maybe things would be different.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 19:22:09	@neontaster Shit comes back around.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 19:53:18	@BadBeavis You know your pops has nicer eyebrows than that, Beav.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 20:10:20	@BlackSabbath A National Acrobat, hands down.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 20:24:54	@CMPunk Since when did Zakk Wylde play dress up?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 21:19:51	@MrMooncricket @sarahmcpants @BadBeavis It's a Galaxy s5. The stock Twitter app sucks. The ONLY thing good about it is the gif capability.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-25 23:52:40	@BadBeavis @itskellam Lol.  You weren't done with it, you just got bitchslapped.  😁
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 00:03:04	@BadBeavis Sorry Beav, but it wasn't until Ant told ya to go screw that you gave it up.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 00:04:00	@White_Resin Fucking Christ! How'd it happen?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 00:06:00	@BadBeavis Lookin a little matted there, Beav. Ya need to hit a groomer.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 00:07:44	@BadBeavis Dude, you're running a fictional cat profile. Learn how to go with the joke.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 00:08:42	@White_Resin That will definitely do it.  How many stitches in all?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 00:17:34	@ClassicShelb Lot of ass fucking goin on in there.  Hairy, man ass fucking.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 00:53:04	@JonHeymanCBS That was so kindhearted of him, wasn't it?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 00:54:02	@MentalityMag Just water.  Watching the little guy play Forza tonight.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 00:54:50	@queenelisabeth Looks like my goatee in the Manic Panic days of the mid 90's. Lucky gal.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 01:33:30	@MentalityMag Hell yeah. Shits pretty good.  End up crip-walking by the end of the night.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 01:46:12	@ExPoleDancer @Netflix @TheRock Tooth fairy.  Two words: pink tutu. G'night.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 01:47:13	@MentalityMag Not when you have the ac cranked down to 68°!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 01:47:55	@FredericaBimmel Then why are you in Philly?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 04:14:24	@BadBeavis Glad I'm not the only one. And I don't even own a cat.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 04:20:24	@Zellyanks My son he been watching nothing but this for the last four days on Netflix.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 03:43:27	@BadBeavis Because cats are stupid fucks that don't know speeding cars can hurt.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 03:44:49	@NekoCase At least you spelled come correctly.  Otherwise, it'd be a whole new ballgame.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 03:48:00	@MentalityMag Jesus, that looks good right about now.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 03:48:29	The Cardigans truly do rock. Fuck you if you don't agree.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 03:52:36	@BadBeavis Well, no one really wants to hit a cat. Or any other creature for that matter.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 04:37:12	@kriztufer @theninapersson At least you get it, my brother.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 12:29:00	@MentalityMag Looks like a whale is stranded on the beach.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 16:22:11	@EastSideDave my cousin and I took our children last weekend. It was a blast! http://t.co/lQj8JfdCJl
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-26 22:41:59	@JimNorton Saaweet!!! Tell me Jim, is it gonna be another 2-parter? Loved episode 1.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 13:41:54	@IslanderNation @OpieRadio And on a bit of a selfish note, at least we have TWO shows to listen to now. So there's that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 13:43:10	@C4Mac @italianman999 @OandAPests @GrovelingUSA @AndyKindler The main thing is that he's just not that funny.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 13:45:13	@ninamarieox You keep popping up in my timeline, so I might as well just follow you. Ass sucking, you say? Monday stinks enough as it is.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 13:46:16	@JosephCumia No guilt here, but that check is kinda hot. Even with the busted up face.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 13:47:05	@C4Mac @italianman999 @OandAPests @GrovelingUSA @AndyKindler Because he has nothing funny to say, might as well bash actual funny people.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 13:48:40	@EthanCarterTNA Not for long, sucka.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 13:57:12	@GrovelingUSA @C4Mac @italianman999 @OandAPests @AndyKindler It's on @TheIBang.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 14:13:51	@IslanderNation lol. Just checked. He blocked me also.  @andykindler  is a cunt.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 14:16:30	@LizSetsFire that has to take some practice. No way that was his first time doing it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 16:36:20	@TruckingJames @OandAPests @aleksnotalex Seems that way, don't it? I'd really be surprised if you got a response from the spineless twat.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 16:37:10	@robr_in_ct @OandAPests @aleksnotalex But Aleks is so much hipper and cooler, no?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 16:41:13	@FredBrooklyn @AndyKindler All I said was that he's just not that funny and he blocked me.  Unfunny cunt.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 16:59:06	Sure, make me sit around all weekend waiting for service calls, &amp; wait until Monday morn to give me 5 of em. Thanks a lot, cocksucker.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 17:00:12	@BadBeavis Fuck em.  Do it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 18:02:39	@sarahmcpants @RonandFezSXM @TheIBang He has changed also. Didn't he get a haircut about a year and a half ago? #StillADrunkenCentaur
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 18:34:14	@FredBrooklyn Lol, have a few of them in the front compartment of my car at this very moment.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 19:10:14	@FredBrooklyn Not only that, but he's a coward.  He doesn't welcome any debate, just blocks you right away. @AndyKindler is a cunt.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 20:04:09	But we are an elite race of our own. The stoners, junkies and freaks.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 20:19:51	@LaughingAtYou5 Truly a monster album.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 20:31:15	@LaughingAtYou5 Agree 100%. Hands down, one of the best albums of the 90's.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 20:33:26	@FredBrooklyn Just looking at that face makes me want to kill a retard.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 21:41:33	@aubreysitterson It was made for imax 3d.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 22:30:09	@RobbyTheBrain @iShatInYourBag Wish there was a way to favorite a tweet more than once.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 22:56:53	@iShatInYourBag @RobbyTheBrain Says the guy who only seems to want to talk about other guys and their cocks. How sweet, you have a crush.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 23:00:09	@OpieRadio Face!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 23:20:57	@TheFourthAmeobi @iShatInYourBag @RobbyTheBrain I'm defending no one.  I'll call out a cunt when it's deserved.  Stop being a cunt.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-28 23:34:38	@LizSetsFire Please come over and set my 9 year old straight.  You can drive a tractor between his front teeth.  #AlreadyCrazyDentalBills
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 00:07:10	@BaileyJayShow Nicki Minaj looks like people vomit a little when they go down on her.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-30 20:16:53	Welcome to Shell Beach. http://t.co/0768reqG6b
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 14:58:18	@neontaster Nice.  Gonna be there Sunday morning.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 22:27:53	@discordianslip depends in what it is.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 22:29:14	@discordianslip Go back? If they're really good, not a chance.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 22:31:42	@discordianslip Then you're a good person. Go back and tell him they made a mistake. You will feel good about it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 22:39:08	@discordianslip Just alright is still better than most.  :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 00:33:11	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain Yeah, I care so much what someone on Twitter thinks of me. So tough holding a shot glass. A real man.  😁
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 00:34:02	@BaileyJayShow About five seconds after guys started ignoring them in order to play video games.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 00:35:07	@RobbyTheBrain He's pretty damn good. The promo wasn't half bad either.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 00:36:17	Gotta admit, the AA off the middle rope was pretty impressive.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 00:37:46	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain Wow, and you can type in all caps too. Wanker.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 00:40:03	Randy Orton's gimmick as a whiney bitch is starting to get stale.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 00:43:28	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain How sweet. The little one can't reply so she sends a YouTube link. Awwww
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 00:47:26	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain Yes, it is just banter. It's just that you suck at it is all. http://t.co/kzOrjDd0yL
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 00:50:06	@RobbyTheBrain Agreed, but other than these two, who else is there? The rest of them other than Natalya can't wrestle worth a damn.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 00:52:51	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain Yes I noticed it.He isn't a part of this conversation, you dope. You're not very good at this, are you?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 00:53:50	@MentalityMag Two beached whales in one day? Must be an epidemic.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 00:54:51	@aubreysitterson @arune I'd like to know if/when AJ will address it during a promo.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 00:56:23	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain Yet you are still replying, you annoying little twat. Go fuck your mother.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 00:59:21	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain Again with the caps? You're running out of steam, boy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 01:05:07	@aubreysitterson Lol, at least Y2J busted out with an Orange Is The New Black reference.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 18:04:29	@BMonzoWFAN So basically the Yankees didn't do one goddamn thing today? That's great.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 23:51:54	@neontaster Olivia Cole really comes off as an ass.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 20:18:35	@sarahmcpants I'm about to start the show.  Is it as bad as peeps made it out to be?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 20:25:46	@sarahmcpants There's an old art bell clip where a caller says he used to work at area 51 &amp; feds are following him.  http://t.co/BCrObc6qtZ
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 20:31:00	@CarlaFinch @sarahmcpants @gbutera09 Just started.  How long into the show does he call?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 20:34:17	@gbutera09 @CarlaFinch @sarahmcpants Art fucked his fans when he bailed on Sirius after 1.5 months.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 20:40:16	@gbutera09 @CarlaFinch @sarahmcpants Wouldn't be surprised at all but Art does have a history of bailing from shows.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 20:49:07	@ThatKevinSmith Proudly gay or gayly proud?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 22:49:36	@discordianslip Amazing how easy it is, ain't it?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 22:57:13	@PhilSagg @OpieRadio I actually got squirmy in my car.  Great week again, brother man!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 23:49:58	@RobbyTheBrain Scott Hall has and will always be a selfish junkie prick.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 01:39:41	@CumiaCollective You sonofabitch. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 01:44:25	@CumiaCollective Good evening, neighbor.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 01:11:43	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain cba=I can't reply to this guy anymore so I'll just go home crying to mommy. Sleep tight, little one.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 01:24:12	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain This is so easy. http://t.co/ryy58oOrOK
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 01:28:30	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain The way it works is like this:When you get your ass handed to you, cursing &amp; acting like a cunt don't work.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 01:32:39	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain The difference is this: You're the one holding your own ass, faggot. http://t.co/MkLUaCOC8H
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 01:37:19	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain Too stupid to understand that you've gotten your ass handed to you? I'm sorry, I thought you could keep up.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 01:38:20	@BadBeavis Beav, this was a perfect opportunity to start roping them in.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 01:41:23	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain Now you're coming around.  Good boy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 01:42:29	@TheRock @danawhite Took the little guy to see it yesterday. Good job to you and the entire crew.  Fun flick!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 01:46:22	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain Right. I support the right of a nation to defend itself against animals that use civilians as human sheilds.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 01:50:52	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain When animals hide missiles in them, too bad. The Palestinians should've taken out their own trash years ago.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 01:55:39	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain Good night little boy. God help you and the animals you support.Such noble creatures. http://t.co/xXdYbdlxCP
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 02:07:44	@TheFourthAmeobi @RobbyTheBrain Then you should be blaming Hamas, not the nation defending itself from them.  Young fool.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 02:09:48	@TheFourthAmeobi  He is but a visual representation of the extremist animals that are allowed to flourish in Europe. Again, young fool.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 02:14:03	@aubreysitterson Nope, no chance of that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 02:15:20	@OneNationRadio And you'll be able to hear him whining a mile away.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 02:51:34	@FredBrooklyn Man, just felt 7 years old again.  The baseball version was pretty sweet too. http://t.co/frjX9q4NFL
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-29 03:08:10	@FredBrooklyn My 2 cousins and I would spend countless hours with both of them. Childhood bliss at it's best.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-30 00:19:28	@LizSetsFire Join the club.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 18:15:30	@JimNorton Great song for show opener today, but I can't stand those songs with the replacement bass/drums.  What sayeth you?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 19:08:27	@FredBrooklyn  @AnthonyCumia @_RyanMN_ And like that, he's gone.  Well done, @OscarMjr321
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-30 01:09:50	@neontaster Long read, but a good one.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-30 01:12:55	@OandAPests @liquid_aluminum So his crazy conspiracy show helped his rep? If he lived "off the grid" in the Baja, why would his rep matter?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-30 01:13:59	@neontaster It was very even handed. Disagreed with some stuff towards the end, but all in all, a good article.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-30 02:12:31	@neontaster I've been psyched for this movie for over a year now.  Can't wait for the weekend.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-30 02:13:31	@Yen_Vi Unfortunately, there's too many of those people on Twitter.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-30 02:22:21	@neontaster Where ya been the last six years?  :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-30 02:56:40	@neontaster Most ani-Israel admin ever. Hell will hold a special place for Barry.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-30 03:00:48	@Zellyanks Not good at all.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 20:38:56	@sarahmcpants My wife used to work at a Walgreens years ago and would come home with the craziest stories about people.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 20:41:51	@FredBrooklyn @AndyKitner For someone who's been speaking on stages for years, he has an absolutely horrid speaking voice.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 20:45:22	@sarahmcpants Her fave was the Asian guy who bought the entire stock of Fleet enemas. She said it was close to 50.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 20:46:33	@gbutera09 @CarlaFinch @sarahmcpants Absolutely. He wanted his online audience to be able to hear it for free. You know SXM wouldn't budge.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 20:47:47	@BadBeavis Happy cats are too boring. You have spunk at least.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 21:08:58	@FredBrooklyn @AndyKindler Is this coming from a source or just a theory?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-07-31 21:30:36	@sarahmcpants @gbutera09 @CarlaFinch You're right, Trent is batshit crazy.  Wow.....
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-03 02:42:02	@AFROandFriends Any eta on erock's show from tonight?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-03 02:48:49	@AFROandFriends Damn, you're good.  Thanks again, man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-02 02:17:38	@erockradio Did it live up to the hype? Seeing it in imax on Sunday. Can't wait.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 02:58:49	Thursday night beers fucking rule!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 03:05:33	@TheOnlySherrod Good luck, man!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 03:06:49	@TheOnlySherrod Hope you had a fun vacation.  And don't fuck around in school.  It actually is important.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 03:12:01	@TheOnlySherrod Good man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 01:01:35	@AFROandFriends How were you able to capture the test shows? Just curious, I'm already paid up. The site only let's me view the most recent.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 01:09:33	@TheCumiaShow Lol, watching it at this very moment.  Those guys are pretty damn funny/quick.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 01:13:13	@AFROandFriends Cool, thanks man. The site will archive them anyway, I was just being nosy. :) Can't wait for tomorrow.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 12:15:22	@CarlaFinch @weirdmedicine I have a pretty good feeling that those 2 will be well out of reach of anyone.  No worries.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 12:18:47	@ninamarieox Staten Island? Most of America took off from school that day.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 12:44:39	@CarlaFinch @weirdmedicine They can, but these two will not be going anywhere.  They aren't letting these 2 out of heavy duty quarantine.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 12:45:26	@LizSetsFire It's called a sideways football when that happens.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 13:01:17	@CarlaFinch @weirdmedicine As long as certain precautions are taken, which I'm sure they are, I think everything should be fine.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-03 13:27:56	@TheOnlySherrod Morning.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 14:32:17	@CarlaFinch @weirdmedicine Lol, but haven't you listened to Dr Steve's Medical Minute about zombies?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 14:37:29	@CarlaFinch @weirdmedicine Yes, I have.  Have you? 😛
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 14:42:22	Got our tickets to see Primus and the Chocolate Factory on November 1st in New Brunswick! Les, Tim and Larry!! @EastSideDave you goin?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 14:47:39	@rvaldes11 I heard it was a pretty awesome show. What did you think?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-02 13:04:23	@FredBrooklyn Well, they started with giving us Obama, why stop there?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 16:23:08	@neontaster nope
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 16:24:09	@CarlaFinch @RonandFezSXM I just wish North American Scum would make a return.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 16:31:34	@neontaster Try it.  I'll send you a dm,  mute me and then check it. Then unmute me.  I've had to unmute peeps before to see previous dms.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 17:15:47	@TheCumiaShow Just signed up. Will there be an option to dl the show when it's over so mobile users won't get hit with data? So excited!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 17:24:39	@FredBrooklyn You da man, Fred. I know there is going to be an on demand feature, just wasn't sure about being able to download. Thanks
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 17:33:29	@gbutera09 @RonandFezSXM We go there every Fall to pick apples. The place is awesome. Too bad they didn't have strawberry picking this year.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 17:40:29	@phargus335 @gbutera09 Fuck that. Let Buckwheat take care of it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 17:46:52	@gbutera09 @phargus335 Exactly
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 18:28:51	@Pilot_Jeff @FredBrooklyn @TheCumiaShow Thanks, man.  Appreciate it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-02 16:49:36	@FredBrooklyn If it's in Detroit or Chicago, I say go for it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 19:08:28	@Pilot_Jeff Am I the only one dumb enough to actually use their full name while signing up on the website?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 19:29:26	@franckrojas1 You seem to be the one talking shit without knowing the real story, you wannabe cocksucker.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 19:40:06	@BadBeavis @slutbomber Lol, horrible photoshop skills, but you get an A+ for making me laugh like crazy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 19:44:13	@Pilot_Jeff cool. Me too. I just want to be sure if we should actually use our real name or just a handle. Thanks. No more dumb questions.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 22:26:34	@phargus335 What's improper about it?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 22:32:38	@phargus335 So ridiculous. I mean, no one gets annoyed if I tug on my earlobe for a little bit.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-01 22:45:11	@BadBeavis You bastard. Why am I not in that picture?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-03 16:26:55	@sabbathfans @pendletwitch Thankfully these days, that's what YouTube is for.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 13:36:40	@LizSetsFire One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just doesn't belong.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 14:12:32	@FredericaBimmel Yeah, but the seat is always toasty warm.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 18:55:33	@LinzBella Oh please elaborate. Ya can't put that out there and not.  😨
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 19:12:56	@LinzBella @tc_az There are a couple of people that pop up in my timeline that I wish just wouldn't.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 19:18:00	@LinzBella @tc_az Lol, it's not "her" is it?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 19:20:51	@LinzBella @tc_az Lol, my lord. 
 You poor dear.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 19:26:29	@neontaster Lol.  Same here.  That's what the on demand feature is for. Just gotta stay away from Twitter for a bit.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 19:29:24	@CrankyOne123 @OpieRadio @JimNorton @DanSoder  Noodles agrees.  http://t.co/zegn0p0k8l
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 19:33:08	@TheCumiaShow hmm.  I'm guessing that's the desktop page?  Only different thing on mobile says "off air".
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 19:33:42	@FredBrooklyn Sweet!! Hot the box and everything! Have fun, Fred.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 19:34:06	@FredBrooklyn Got.  Damn sausage fingers.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 19:35:25	@CrankyOne123 @OpieRadio @JimNorton @DanSoder http://t.co/JRQZd0ca2C He is the bestest ever.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-04 19:37:08	@CrankyOne123 @OpieRadio @JimNorton @DanSoder I'll try that pic again.  http://t.co/SFNZ62u5Sl
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-03 19:35:39	@erockradio Just got back from seeing it.  It was great in all aspects.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-05 19:56:53	@neontaster I loved it.  Fantastic film.  Imax made it even better.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-05 20:39:36	@FredBrooklyn what happened??
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-05 20:43:50	@FredBrooklyn I thought it was something that has to do with his sports show. I will be listening to anthony when I get home.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-05 20:46:51	@FredBrooklyn he has always come off as a bit of a douche.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-05 20:47:23	@FredBrooklyn Jay,not Dice.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-03 21:30:22	@FredBrooklyn Have a feeling that we'll all be sitting slack-jawed in utter amazement at some of the revelations. Too bad I have to work.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-03 21:31:40	@WMGvac @AnthonyCumia It's on H100@ 6am.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-03 21:32:46	@FredBrooklyn But that's what on demand is for.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-06 15:50:02	@rvaldes11 that looks pretty goddamn awesome.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-06 16:51:40	@OandAshow Too bad Whitney is an unfunny bore.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-06 17:16:17	@THENYGENERAL not only does the overly stretched face make me ill, but she is just horribly unfunny.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-05 03:47:39	@thecumiashow Great 1st show. When will audio on demand download feature be available so I can listen on the road? Mobile data rates stink.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-05 11:27:11	@LizSetsFire Weren't they just making fun of their new single not too long ago?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-05 11:34:22	@EastSideDave You get a new gig? Right on beautiful Main St in Belmar.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-05 11:37:16	@TheCumiaShow Thanks, Keith.  Great 1st show.  Here's to many more!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-05 13:24:01	@JimNorton she's ok, but that Black Sabbath shirt is beautiful. Never seen that one before.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-05 14:59:09	@AFROandFriends @enemy_driver hopefully they fix that soon. They did say the show would be available for download after original broadcast.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-07 12:13:40	@EastSideDave @RatRock959 What shift do you do my man?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-07 12:30:01	@ExPoleDancer That's actually pretty damn hilarious.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-07 16:45:47	@ExPoleDancer There's nothing wrong with what she said? Yet another free pass. I'd like to see a male say the reverse and see what happens.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-07 22:35:43	@TheOnlySherrod Just read it myself.  His shtick was getting stale, but this was a total surprise.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-07 22:36:42	@aubreysitterson Either it was serial harassment or he got physical with someone backstage.  Unreal.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-07 22:41:30	@aubreysitterson Him and Riccardo Rodriguez can now do indie shows together at least.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-07 22:44:47	@aubreysitterson Was he on the Australia tour?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-07 22:51:01	@PeckerHarden @Shartblaster Only thing that matters is cream or cheddar cheese?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-07 22:59:23	@Shartblaster @PeckerHarden Can't hang with the cream cheese.  Too lactose intolerant.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-07 23:01:09	@Shartblaster @PeckerHarden I wish it was just that. Stabbing intestinal pains.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-07 23:09:49	@PeckerHarden @Shartblaster That's the only good thing about it. After the stabbing pains subside, I squirt like a champ.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-07 23:31:32	@Shartblaster @PeckerHarden Back atcha!  http://t.co/vdEFrsG8vR
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-08 14:16:13	@RybackRAGE Gotta admit, the screens I've seen from 2k15 look great.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:36:14	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip @wbfletcher MegaGina, is that like aunt Jemima?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:38:09	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip @wbfletcher Classy? Just like the broken home, broken English you've been spewing for the last few hours?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:38:44	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip @wbfletcher Someone you've never had to worry about. You must be so proud.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:40:55	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip @wbfletcher It's easier to kill daddy when you actually know who he is.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:46:06	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip @wbfletcher Pears are juicy.It's better than the fat slug look you "homies" are into. http://t.co/lgirRO458h
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:49:26	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip @wbfletcher Again with the faggotry. Straighten up, ya mo.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:50:23	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip @wbfletcher And wonder why even blacks from other countries can't stand you.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:56:12	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip @wbfletcher New jokes, like pretending that you know what you're talking about?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:59:23	@discordianslip @popularcritic1 @wbfletcher Well since he's gone, I guess I'll go launch some nukes and try to find Egypt on a map.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 01:15:56	@Alsboringtweets Sad when they pass. Narcissistic and selfish when they bring it upon themselves.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 01:19:03	@JennyJohnsonHi5 Not true. Plenty are laughing. When you do it to yourself, you deserve to get laughed at.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 01:43:31	@RandomDonk I'm thinking bowler.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 01:46:05	@Madde1603 @JennyJohnsonHi5 People deserve the truth. Pure selfishness. Truly nothing more selfish than that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 02:30:58	@Madde1603 But that's exactly my point. Suicide is an easy way out, except for the ones left behind.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-08 18:35:48	@neontaster the religion of peace, correct?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-08 20:21:19	@TheCumiaShow Awesome opening week of shows, Keith.  Thanks for all the hard work.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-08 20:22:24	@LizSetsFire @notsam Not that you're asking me, but I'd be Patches Van Buren.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-08 21:43:45	@JimNorton @CharlotteAlter seemed to totally miss the point of your article. Well written, but off the mark.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-09 17:31:00	@TheOnlySherrod You love it!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-09 17:31:15	@TheOnlySherrod You'll
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-09 18:00:27	@gbutera09 We'll be there in mid September. More mead for me!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 14:10:14	@phargus335 That didn't last too long. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 14:53:14	@phargus335 Or his broken spirit.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 15:19:00	@CBSLocalSports @WFAN660 Maybe her hot-headed nephew should've stayed in his car.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 15:20:34	@wbfletcher Depends on what you did.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 15:23:10	@wbfletcher Lol, totally your fault. Now ya gotta call those assholes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-08 23:29:53	@hwinkler4real Yes.  It's called a cellphone. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-08 23:33:16	@hwinkler4real Lol. Very good point sir.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 20:18:34	@goodboygreg @discordianslip If you think anything happens when you die, you're a fucking idiot.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-10 02:00:04	@FredBrooklyn I'm actually watching The Other Woman at the moment.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-10 03:48:30	@discordianslip I'll quietly raise my hand. :)
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-10 04:08:20	The Internship basically sucks.  Such a shitty movie.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 11:40:08	@phargus335 Good thought, but it's their not there.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 12:37:02	@jackdatow2335 @phargus335 Wow, Catholic school?  Guess you're used to failure and mistakes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 13:04:50	@phargus335 I'm sure eating something would be an option.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 13:08:46	@phargus335 She sure as hell wouldn't be reading about it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 14:34:35	@Hakedoffhafpint I think Big Jay Oakerson is the guest.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 15:07:55	@ber_kett That makes me mad.  Can't they make a straight arrow?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 15:16:03	@gbutera09 @ber_kett Apparently they found a way.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 16:40:17	@LinzBella Hey there!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-14 00:39:59	@AndyKindIer @op_thedestroyer @AnthonyCumia You know you're a cock smoking faggot. Stop frontin'.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-14 00:41:40	@RobbyTheBrain Call rasslin' as you see it. Don't always agree w/ you, but you always at least have your reasons.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-14 00:42:38	@MentalityMag I think the first handjob I got was from a man dressed as a woman in a times square peep show.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-14 00:45:44	@MentalityMag Well, it was a pretty fantastic handjob.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-14 01:41:16	@Hanzi83 Your point? Hmm, who'd I rather be, the millionaire or the bipolar camel jockey with no job?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-14 01:46:24	@wbfletcher Cops typically don't bring out the riot squad just for shits &amp; giggles. Stop fucking things up and you'll be fine. Dummies.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-14 01:47:46	@Hanzi83 You've said it countless times, you fat piece of shit.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 20:25:37	@RobbyTheBrain Will be waiting with anticipation.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 20:40:17	@JosephCumia @TheCumiaShow Would this work, Joe?  😉 http://t.co/KPxzwp7HXJ
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 20:44:27	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip The main problem is brothers shooting other brothers. Worry about that, idiot.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 20:46:12	@discordianslip @popularcritic1 Then people would be crying, "why are all the businesses leaving the community?"
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 20:46:48	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip Wanna bet?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-14 03:12:32	@aubreysitterson But you followed him just like the rest of us, didn't you?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 20:47:33	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip 1-I don't have a niece. 2-Stop thinking about my dick, faggot.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 20:50:08	@JosephCumia @TheCumiaShow Very good,  but this will beat them both.  http://t.co/oBSPVFmIwq
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 20:51:19	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip Surprise, surprise. Another homie on the DL.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 20:54:06	@discordianslip @popularcritic1 But you could have gotten a "great job with benefits and vacation time within a year".
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 21:06:09	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip So blacks have adopted faggotry into their community? Is that what you were trying to tell me, Einstein?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 21:08:19	@popularcritic1 So you're both a faggot and a thief. Again, no surprise.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 21:15:34	@popularcritic1 Your intelligence is just astonishing. Mother insults? Wow, you're so good at this, it's scary.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 21:20:56	@popularcritic1 I would insult your father, but you wouldn't know who I'm talking about.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 21:25:15	@popularcritic1 Hardly. You're not very good at this, are you? Slowing down already?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 21:29:19	@popularcritic1 You must be sleepy because you're not driven. No work ethic. It's sad, actually.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 21:40:32	@popularcritic1 Is that even English? You should've paid better attention in school, "homie". 😐
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 21:49:45	@popularcritic1 I knew it. You really are baf at this. Don't correct your insults.  Makes you looks even more foolish than you already do.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 21:56:50	@popularcritic1 Wow, you're catching on, sonny. At least I now know you can read.  Just can't create sentences.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 22:45:59	@wbfletcher @popularcritic1 @discordianslip This mool still talking about gettin' dick? He didn't believe me when I called him a faggot.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 22:51:09	@JimNorton What's that, Jim?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 23:04:26	@popularcritic1 @wbfletcher @discordianslip because I'm amazed at how stupid you are.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 23:06:29	@popularcritic1 @wbfletcher @discordianslip That's the color of privilege, you dumb animal.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 23:21:05	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip @wbfletcher Yeah, but blacks have flat noses with really huge nostrils. And we can always use bronzer.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 23:26:19	@popularcritic1 @wbfletcher @discordianslip Pharaohs?  Like the kind from Egypt that isn't in Africa? Silly negroid.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 23:29:47	@popularcritic1 @wbfletcher @discordianslip Simple.  Because they're better than blacks.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 23:35:48	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip @wbfletcher It's because your neighbors are filled with filthy, do nothing animals.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-11 23:59:23	@popularcritic1 @wbfletcher @discordianslip Now you're repeating yourself. Can't come up with anything new, monkey boy?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:03:40	@RobbyTheBrain @WWE Agreed.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:04:55	@popularcritic1 @wbfletcher @discordianslip Yeah, we know.  The nigg nogg that can't construct intelligent sentences.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:05:49	@discordianslip @popularcritic1 @wbfletcher What about me?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:08:18	@popularcritic1 @wbfletcher @discordianslip You're right.  Original man looked a lot like you. Big nose, monkey ass, knuckle dragger.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:10:49	@discordianslip @popularcritic1 @wbfletcher mmmmm I loves me sum white bitches.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:12:03	@popularcritic1 @wbfletcher @discordianslip We evolved, you're still stuck with the cro-mag look.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:15:02	@popularcritic1 @wbfletcher @discordianslip You forgot to add "zing" after that last one, caveman. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:18:27	@popularcritic1 @wbfletcher @discordianslip Now your people can't pay their own water bills in Detroit and have to rely on others for it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:22:23	@popularcritic1 @wbfletcher @discordianslip Rather be a borrower than a leach in society.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:23:23	@popularcritic1 @wbfletcher @discordianslip checkmate? Guys, I'm starting to think he really is a retard. http://t.co/IcIyR3P4Xf
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:24:21	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip @wbfletcher Don't lie.  The only thing you run for is a handout.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:28:53	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip @wbfletcher Beyotch? Twice in the same tweet? Wow, Leroy. You're good.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:31:28	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip @wbfletcher Don't you mean LMMAO? Laugh my monkey ass off?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:33:54	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip @wbfletcher He's gotta go pick out his afro. http://t.co/waq7x51qTX
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-12 00:35:06	@popularcritic1 @discordianslip @wbfletcher Better than white jokes from the jobless.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-14 23:56:51	@SpikeLeeJigaboo @theCDVigil I tweet about anti-gay issues. Blacks that resemble Jabba The Hutt don't deserve my respect. Fat ass hypocrite.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-14 23:57:32	"@SpikeLeeJigaboo: @theCDVigil homosexuality is wrong, I have no respect 4 faggots" Bomb this pigger.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-14 19:33:54	@kyle_ricci @OandAPests @rob_in_ct @CumiaCollective @LChipChipperson @AnthonyCumia see my last retweet.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-15 00:48:24	@SpikeLeeJigaboo @theCDVigil So are you, fatso.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-15 00:49:04	@SpikeLeeJigaboo Ooh, fat pigger. Really scary.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-15 01:31:24	@MotherShuck @JosephCumia @richiebnutz That was my only run-in with it also. Burned like a bitch! Fucked like a beast that night though.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-15 02:11:16	@JosephCumia @MotherShuck @richiebnutz Harold. His name was Harold and he was an angel. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-13 13:48:29	@rickygervais @rolandos99 I'm too busy rockin out to hear you. http://t.co/NcNBI5aFGS
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-13 14:50:52	@bigjayoakerson @DanSoder @SIRIUSXM Loved the show, Jay!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-15 11:43:53	@joanna_michels My bet is both.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-15 11:52:55	@BadBeavis @StressFactoryCC Fuck.  Are we gonna have to sit through Vinnie's horrible prank calls with that dumb pay phone again?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-15 12:44:44	One more fucking day til vacation starts. Can't wait. Seriously need it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-15 17:00:22	@elonjames @spicedrum No. They called rioters, not protesters, animals.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-15 18:21:40	@Djbuttafingers @rob_in_ct @AnthonyCumia It's actually horrid.  You're coming off as a complete idiot.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-15 18:58:58	@unquietpirate @Ftbcom135 @Salon No, but what will you say if it comes out Brown did actually reach for the cops gun?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-15 19:03:37	@AFROandFriends Damn, you're fast!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-15 21:18:37	@unquietpirate @Ftbcom135 @Salon Lol. Of course.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-16 00:15:24	@notsam @JustinRoberts Damn good article.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-16 19:46:34	@AFROandFriends @UncPaulHideOut To who? Ant? I do, that's all I care about. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-16 19:58:49	@JoeandEvan @JoeBrew212 I think he'll take it, but what do you think about a part timer holding the belt(s)?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-16 20:58:47	@crackker019 @JosephCumia @AnthonyCumia Millah, Caus.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-16 12:30:49	The yearly shaving of my back means only one thing. It's vacation time motherfuckers!!!!!!! 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-16 14:05:26	@BadBeavis What's worse is pulling one out of your ass crack.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-16 14:06:11	@BadBeavis With or without a custom autograph?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-17 01:00:20	@FredBrooklyn @FuckTheMallcops @ItsYo_TimeBELLA Who's Will?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-16 16:02:07	@JRsBBQ Do you know if any stores in South Carolina carry your products? We are going for a week and would love to pick some up.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-18 00:08:54	Why did Hogan say 6 pay per views? There's double that per year. Wtf, Hogan?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-18 00:09:42	@mmaencyclopedia @aubreysitterson He's gotten absolutely atrocious at it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-18 00:09:42	@mmaencyclopedia @aubreysitterson He's gotten absolutely atrocious at it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-18 00:32:39	# Summerslam @wwe Your stream absolutely sucks tonight. Guess there were some cutbacks to the network as well,  huh?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-18 00:37:50	@OpieTranslator @WWE Wouldn't be much worse. They should be ashamed.  Ashamed, I say!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-18 00:43:06	@OpieTranslator How silly and selfish of me. Not that it's one of the big four or anything. Oh.... Wait....
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-18 00:49:26	@RobbyTheBrain @WWE Yeah but it's not the first time.  Or even the second.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-16 17:15:52	@ChipChipperson @iamcolinquinn You tell 'em, Chippa. Fuckin cocksucka.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-18 02:29:32	@erockradio @WWE For real??
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-17 14:00:19	@neontaster That's a picture of a swat team member painted on the side. Tough dudes that don't fuck around.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-17 14:05:04	@Buster_ESPN @jimmyparsons30 Stepping off the mound and out of the batter's box after every pitch is slowing it down. Enforce the rules.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-17 14:10:41	@Johnny__law @Buster_ESPN No, it's paying customers that have to sit through it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-17 14:53:01	@OpieRadio As silly as it sounds that's a pretty widely used term in regards to grand juries. Some semi famous politician/judge said it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-20 13:30:02	@THENYGENERAL He's ok. Just flexing his fuck muscle, that's all.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-21 13:23:42	@WestJournalism The reason is there aren't enough African Americans down there.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-22 17:13:54	I don't give  fuck what your Twitter account is worth. No one cares but you.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-22 17:15:11	@xomaryjeanxo Not a bad thing at all.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-23 18:36:27	@tacsSupport @TheCumiaShow Started using the rss feed the other day with @BeyondPod. Flawless once I got the hang of it.  Thanks guys!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-23 18:43:39	@iamcolinquinn No, Americans can just see better.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-23 22:10:23	@joshuaua20 @LarryCT @OpieRadio But you don't, so shut the fuck up please.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-25 16:08:00	@ber_kett @RonandFezSXM They did tweet yesterday that they were gonna be off today.  Back live tomorrow.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-25 16:10:46	@ber_kett @RonandFezSXM Agreed.  First day back from vacation and I'm stuck listening to sports talk on am radio.  Boooooo!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-25 16:14:53	@ber_kett @RonandFezSXM Jeez. Are things that bad? At least I was listening to WFAN. ESPN radio is absolutely horrible.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-23 23:19:27	@csjohns7 @tacsSupport @TheCumiaShow Try @beyondpod. Worked like a charm.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-25 16:20:03	@ber_kett @RonandFezSXM Wow. Lousy, one sided political talk or ESPN? Talk about a sad state of affairs.  😳
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-25 16:20:56	@LizSetsFire Well, if your log was as you said it was, it should be fairly easy today.  😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-25 17:00:40	@ExPoleDancer @DRUDGE_REPORT Funny, I don't remember reports of Jews lobbing rockets into Germany in the late 1930's.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-25 17:02:26	@joanna_michels My wife shakes her head when she sees me sitting at the computer desk, checking Twitter on my phone.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-24 01:22:42	@BadBeavis Not even close, Beav.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-24 01:23:31	@BadBeavis  "I did it all for you! "
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-25 22:38:44	@GuyInGreenWWE @RealPaigeWWE Everything he said was spot-on. Best Diva on  the roster. Could end up being one of THE best ever.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-25 13:41:17	@LionelMedia @Celichi See what fun you can have when you don't shit in your water supply?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-26 03:13:31	@RobbyTheBrain Am I the only one completely sick of seeing Flair and Hogan try to talk? They may have been good once, but not any more.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-27 14:58:06	@AFROandFriends Link comes up as page not found. Any eta on R&amp;F from yesterday?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-27 20:16:22	@AFROandFriends Wow,  what an amazing coincidence.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-27 15:00:34	@DineshDSouza @ExPoleDancer Too late. He's turned into an utter disgrace and even his one time supporters know it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-27 15:03:35	@AFROandFriends Sweet man,  take your time, it's much appreciated.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-26 20:05:25	@UncPaulHideOut Hey man, just wanted to follow ya. Is registration open at the site?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-26 20:39:40	What happened to @AFROandFriends?  Did the lawyers get to him?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-26 20:42:10	@AFROandFriends damn, man. Sorry to hear that. Thought they got to you for a second.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-08-29 14:03:02	@LizSetsFire The question is, hot or cold? I ate cold beef lo mein last night when I got home. Yummers.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-01 12:38:51	@ber_kett @CarlaFinch @RonandFezSXM @SIRIUSXM He's got the nerve to criticize others about dead air? Pepper was too nice.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-01 12:52:33	@ber_kett @CarlaFinch @RonandFezSXM @SIRIUSXM Or have him play the "please don't let them break us apart, Ronnie" crying clip.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-01 12:55:20	@ber_kett @CarlaFinch @RonandFezSXM @SIRIUSXM Ron is too loyal. Way too loyal. Fez must have some dirt.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-01 13:00:46	@ber_kett @CarlaFinch @RonandFezSXM @SIRIUSXM Agreed.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-01 13:01:21	@ber_kett @CarlaFinch @RonandFezSXM @SIRIUSXM He's still hoping Fez firms it around.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-01 13:23:36	@ber_kett @CarlaFinch @RonandFezSXM @SIRIUSXM This is where Sirius is smart, you can't sue someone for not offering you a new contract.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-01 13:26:44	@CarlaFinch @ber_kett @RonandFezSXM @SIRIUSXM I'm the worst Catholic ever and could recite that during the blackest of blackouts.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-01 12:42:49	@ber_kett @CarlaFinch @RonandFezSXM @SIRIUSXM I'm surprised he held it together as well as he did.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-01 12:51:00	@ber_kett @CarlaFinch @RonandFezSXM @SIRIUSXM I was waiting for Shelby to find and play the "retard" comment.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-01 13:09:54	@ber_kett @CarlaFinch @RonandFezSXM @SIRIUSXM I can't see how they bring him back once this mini contract runs out.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-01 13:15:53	@CarlaFinch @ber_kett @SIRIUSXM I'm really surprised that they would keep him on track with the original problem. BURGERS AREN'T STEAKS!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-01 13:22:29	@CarlaFinch @ber_kett @RonandFezSXM @SIRIUSXM Best line of any song ever, "Fez is all weird and sad."
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-02 19:49:26	@DanSoder @bigjayoakerson @SIRIUSXM Can't wait!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-04 00:55:02	@NekoCase Can I have the celery in that middle box please?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-04 14:39:52	@sarahmcpants My wife has been working from home for a while now. She wonders why I'm so cranky in the morning as she sits in her jammies.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-04 15:58:55	@sarahmcpants "I worked hard all day." Sure. While sitting with a puppy on your lap with Netflix on in the background. Whatevs......
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-05 13:04:08	@OpieRadio Fuck the haters, have a great weekend, man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-05 13:06:03	@FredBrooklyn Whores, all of them. ☺
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-05 02:28:28	@discordianslip So basically you're gonna treat it like the other 11?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-05 02:32:33	@discordianslip Act out more? You tellin us you're gonna rob a bank or something?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-05 19:05:22	@billburr lol, we all know someone like that. Some of us are even that very guy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-08 16:51:55	@discordianslip Stop tugging on it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-08 16:56:13	@discordianslip So am I.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-10 20:27:04	@OandAPests @Houghton91 If the attention whore doesn't like it, she shouldn't listen. Easy peasy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-10 20:35:31	@Houghton91 @mrhale13 @OandAPests lol sarcasm suits you.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-10 20:37:00	@Houghton91 @mrhale13 @OandAPests That subreddit is full of nothing but whining little bitches.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-10 20:40:38	@mrhale13 @OandAPests @Houghton91 Not really. Way different than listening to an established show/ personality.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-09 13:55:59	@AFROandFriends If people can't wait five seconds and click an extra link,  fuck 'em. No explanation necessary, my friend.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-12 20:51:07	@FredBrooklyn Wow, Todd actually comes off as a decent guy here.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-12 23:09:46	@AFROandFriends Are there any type of invite codes? A friend since 4th grade is looking to get in on the fun.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-13 01:26:14	@AFROandFriends Already found it. And my buddy is enjoying it already. Thanks again man for everything.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-17 17:35:46	@BMonzoWFAN I know, Cena beating  up on Lesnar the other night was crazy, right? 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-17 17:37:00	@THENYGENERAL @ibellabee @rude_jude Definitely a queeb and quite possibly a quay.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-17 17:39:48	@BMonzoWFAN YES! YES! YES! http://t.co/aIeS2CmspS
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-20 20:13:48	@neontaster Lol, saw the same exact ad today.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-22 00:40:46	@RobbyTheBrain Too bad there was no one in attendance to hear it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-22 12:03:43	@IMPACTWRESTLING @RobbyTheBrain That be like comparing an S5 to a Nokia flip phone. No thanks.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-24 02:04:03	@TheCumiaShow Will previous submissions still be used or do we have to send one every day?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-24 02:31:10	@TheCumiaShow Cool man, thanks. Just watched the Bea Arthur clip, fuckin hilarious!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-23 19:06:56	@AFROandFriends @UncPaulHideOut Why, did you receive a "letter"?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-23 19:09:06	@AFROandFriends @UncPaulHideOut Again? Poor guy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-23 19:09:40	@AFROandFriends @UncPaulHideOut Anyway, weather is definitely better than a letter.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-25 21:47:09	@Zellyanks Is the game still scheduled to start on time?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-26 12:12:34	@joanna_michels Nope.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-29 15:02:17	@AFROandFriends there seems to be a problem with the files.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-29 15:04:23	@AFROandFriends zippyshare files are not working.  Mediafire works fine.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-29 15:07:20	@AFROandFriends on mobile, multi-city share files only take about a second and a half to download. Then will not play.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-29 15:12:52	@AFROandFriends  weird. The Zippy share files would not work with my s5. Mediafire works fine. Listening now.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-09-29 23:24:09	@KimJonesSports Didn't he say that prior to yesterday's game also?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-01 12:01:20	@JosephCumia @OpieRadio @JimNorton @AnthonyCumia Brilliant, Joe.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-02 00:41:29	@rolandos99  Roland, you know that @erockradio would never drop a hot or cold burrito.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-12 17:33:45	@EastSideDave Is that the Silverball Arcade in Asbury Park? Love that place!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-14 21:58:44	@WWE Aside from @TheRock, you've really been striking out with the guest stars. Please stop.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-13 16:31:43	@wbfletcher @RonandFezSXM If it's a knockout pool, ties should stay in.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-13 16:33:31	@wbfletcher @RonandFezSXM It's not the super bowl. There's plenty of time for peeps to be cut down.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-13 16:35:38	@RonandFezSXM @jaymohr37 @claytoncomic In a knockout pool, a tie should move on. If your team didn't lose, you should be able to stay.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-13 16:37:27	@wbfletcher @RonandFezSXM That dope shouldn't be allowed to be in it in the 1st place. It's a game for comics. He doesn't count as one.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-20 16:47:26	@artiequitter You've still don't see that he used your addiction as show material? He played you 'til the end, Art.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-22 14:17:16	@artiequitter We're still waiting for that day, Art.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-28 00:44:50	@aubreysitterson If it ended clean, I would've been fine with it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-28 00:52:21	@DanaUnleashed @THENYGENERAL @mayhemmiller Guess he's trying to raise funds for lawyers.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-28 01:16:06	@neontaster Guy comes off as a major dick. Oh wait, that must be my privilege talking. Sorry.....
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-28 01:19:11	@RobbyTheBrain He has. He's the 2nd, maybe 3rd most powerful person in the company. Don't be silly.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-28 01:42:28	"@TheOnlySherrod: "I'd like to make a certain bleach blonde superstar squeal." I was thinking about Lana when he said that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-28 01:42:54	@RobbyTheBrain Yeah, they're not 12.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-28 00:35:51	@THENYGENERAL @nytimes that's fucking hideous.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-29 13:49:16	@LinzBella Why would anyone want to put family on Twitter? It's a cesspool of assholes. Myself included, of course, but still.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-01 13:58:23	@JoeandEvan I say do a 15 minute Hell In A Cell recap.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-01 14:09:58	@notsam @evanwecksell Available anywhere else for non-itunes users?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-01 14:32:39	@notsam @evanwecksell @Stitcher Thanks, you're truly a professional broadcaster.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-10-30 14:11:22	Happy birthday @hwinkler4real
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-01 17:16:07	@notsam @evanwecksell  rss works perfectly with @BeyondPod. Thanks, Sammy!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-04 01:20:43	@RobbyTheBrain And of course they had to cut to a commercial. Fucking lame.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-04 01:30:30	@aubreysitterson Agreed. BTW, the 'cast works awesomely with beyondpod!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-04 15:05:25	@queenelisabeth I'm more annoyed that Opie keeps trying to find things that bother Jim F. Seems too forced.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-07 13:22:11	@THENYGENERAL @JabeenKaneez Sure, live your life under the control of an imaginary fool. Fucking idiots.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-07 14:53:44	@FredBrooklyn @DRUDGE_REPORT But its the religion of peace!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-07 21:39:39	@GBRIELGRY @mazlow01 Please tell me that has to do with a video game of some sort....
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-06 19:35:05	@CMPunk Thoughts on Joe Madden becoming manager of the Cubs?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-09 20:26:45	@FredBrooklyn You bastard.....
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-09 20:45:48	@AFROandFriends I think Ronnie B said it was on tonight at 7 on raw dog. I'll look and see.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-09 20:49:41	@AFROandFriends Here. Looks like tonight at 7 on raw dog is correct.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-09 20:50:04	@AFROandFriends Damn. Forgot link....   http://t.co/WC4PJBIweB
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-09 21:22:15	@rolandos99 The Jets won, ro ro. 😊
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-09 21:58:23	@AFROandFriends Ron kept saying during the week it'd air Sunday night. Much appreciated, my friend.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-09 19:42:44	@AFROandFriends Are you going to be adding the comedy competition that airs tonight?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-13 00:47:30	@LinzBella ok, I gave a follow. Please accept it. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-13 00:49:53	@LinzBella Goddamn. Three pics in and I'm chubbin' up.  Thanks Linz!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-13 01:00:03	@rolandos99 @OandAshow @OpieRadio @jeffdunham @VicHenley Sounds like too many. Hope someone told Vic not to be a douche to any guests.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-14 15:01:21	@RealPaigeWWE @TalkIsJericho @OfficialSkidRow Listening right now. Awesome!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-13 12:00:32	@Geordie_Tait @neontaster @Based_Tet @arthur_affect You're a goddamn idiot, you white knight douchebag.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-18 02:04:20	@RobbyTheBrain Amazing how quiet the crowd is when Bray Wyatt speaks. People don't ever want to miss what he's saying.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-18 02:04:53	@aubreysitterson What about "Jack" like Cena?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-17 15:40:16	@THENYGENERAL2 New handle?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-17 15:42:16	@THENYGENERAL2 Lol, now faggotry can continue....
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-17 15:43:17	@THENYGENERAL2 Some people here can handle anything, some act like cunts at the drop of a hat.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-24 04:13:53	Where's my #SurvivorSeries Fallout????
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-24 04:15:12	@TyTwinny It's listed, but not available yet for some dumb reason.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-24 04:22:09	@AskWWENetwork Wheres the post show for #SurvivorSeries?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-24 04:22:39	@WWENetwork where is the #SurvivorSeries post show?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-26 00:10:31	@TheCumiaShow With this week's free trial, are you able to watch/listen live or can you listen/watch later?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-26 20:19:33	@Callisto1947 White guilt.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-26 20:28:52	@susan_weich @ryanjreilly Let's see them out there when the sun goes down. Oh that's right, their parents aren't that brave. Or stupid.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-11-28 13:24:00	@fergusonaction @FredBrooklyn Whoever designed the shirt needs to learn how to spell.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-02 14:56:38	@Newshdogg @AFROandFriends I only had the problem with Dolphin Browser. Had to uninstall. On chrome now, which sucks. Need Dolphin back.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-02 01:58:57	@AFROandFriends 1:Have u gotten anyone asking about bookmarking your site the last day or so? Whatever folder your site is in, it deletes it
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-02 02:00:03	@AFROandFriends 2:im on a galaxy s5 using Dolphin Browser. I have to Un and reinstall, reload bookmarks, but as soon as I log into afro,
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-02 02:00:40	@AFROandFriends 3:it clears out all the other bookmarks in the folder that it's in. Any idea? Weird, man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-02 02:08:59	@THENYGENERAL2 thugs? The article I read said they were just youngsters. How strange.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-02 02:12:24	@AFROandFriends 1:Agreed, but it is only happening with afro. Whatever folder I put it in, it renders that folder empty, even though
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-02 02:12:52	@AFROandFriends 2:the bookmarks are there on my pc desktop.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-02 23:36:40	@Jerbear1973 @Newshdogg @AFROandFriends I was beginning to think i was the crazy one.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-02 23:45:16	@aubreysitterson Bullshit. It's the fact that the champ is nowhere. He is irrelevant.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-03 03:12:51	@NekoCase Sweet. Coming to Jersey anytime soon? 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-03 17:06:06	@beatsbydre @KylieJenner @KendallJenner Stay out of my feed, you spamming pieces of shit. I'm buying @SennheiserUSA from now on.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-03 15:26:52	@AFROandFriends No issue with any browser except Dolphin. But it's definitely tied to a+f. Tried more than 10 times, every time, craps out.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-03 20:54:09	@FredBrooklyn I say we all walk around with our peckers hanging out of our pants.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-04 14:06:24	@DolphinBrowser A certain site's bookmark keeps corrupting the folder that it's in. Makes the contents of folder become invisible.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-07 18:12:04	@RobbyTheBrain If those fighters are good enough, they'll make it there. If Punk isn't, he'll be gone. What makes you think he'll suck?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-09 02:06:55	@RobbyTheBrain Bad idea? Maybe, but 'Taker really looked old and weak in that match, and not because of the way it was booked. It was time.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-09 02:20:16	@RobbyTheBrain Actually the crowd was good about it. Hardly heard any at all.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-09 03:07:18	@DanSoder @RachelFeinstein Please tell me you're staying in NY.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-09 03:07:46	@neontaster No, not proofreading is. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-09 17:40:29	@DanSoder Then best of luck to you, sir. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-09 17:43:16	@DanSoder While I got your ear, when's the next time we'll hear your dulcet tones on either @OpieRadio or @TheIBang ?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-10 20:42:59	@IGN Don't worry, it's back. It'll always be back.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-12 01:19:20	@TripleH What did ya think of Kevin Owens' debut? He was damn good, in my opinion. Keep up the great work down there.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-12 03:47:05	@RobbyTheBrain From beginning to end, EVERY match kicked some serious ass.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-18 17:37:55	@LinzBella That poo-nanny (and everything else) was probably too damn good. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-18 17:38:42	@artiequitter Christ man, get your shit together. Enough already.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-18 17:32:13	@LinzBella More of you to see? Can't say I'm too upset about this turn of events. Sorry you have to deal with shit though.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-19 15:14:34	@ber_kett Join the club.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-21 01:31:12	@FredBrooklyn I do. Love all their products. Whatcha wanna know?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-22 21:07:12	@BlackFridayMGT @OpieRadio Keep posting faggoty song lyrics, fatso.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-22 16:03:24	@OpieandJimmy @DennisFalcone As long as he wasn't dressed like baby new year.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-22 23:06:29	@AFROandFriends The nature of most people is stupidity. Just block them.  That'll learn 'em.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-22 17:31:28	@AFROandFriends Same to you, my man. And thanks for all you do.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-23 00:45:45	@RandomDonk Nice. Saw it on Netflix last night and never knew it even existed. Thanks. Will watch some tonight.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-23 00:52:44	@TheNewCurrent @JimNorton @BilldeBlasio Then you have a warped vision of what "the best" is, you dope.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-23 01:00:48	@RandomDonk I absolutely will. Thanks for the heads up.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-24 04:02:52	This shit is actually pretty good. And I'm pretty buzzed. http://t.co/c5GMurAEZR
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-27 14:10:53	@NekoCase Damn right it did.
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-30 03:37:20	@THENYGENERAL1 Those three whores still there?
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-30 03:39:54	@RobbyTheBrain Goosebumps!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-30 03:41:06	@THENYGENERAL1 Still doesn't mean ya can't fuck all three of 'em. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2014-12-30 17:09:54	@JoeandEvan I agree. He is a horrible talker and low on the charisma scale.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-01 20:13:22	@artiequitter Our jokes will improve as soon as yours do.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-06 19:03:36	@BMonzoWFAN But aren't those fools supposed to be the best of the best at what they do? Total joke, and I'm a Yankees fan.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-11 03:47:30	@AFROandFriends I was gonna ask you if anyone still downloaded that assshat's poor excuse for a podcast. #kktitn #gayasstattoo
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-13 03:34:37	@RobbyTheBrain  Agreed, but should Hogan be the one inducting him? I'm kinda sick of Hogan at this point.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-13 03:35:06	@aubreysitterson I couldn't disagree more. Enough of Hogan.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-13 03:36:16	The Ascension just bores me. They seem to bore the crowds also. #RAW
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-13 21:12:32	@aubreysitterson Rough Boys by Pete Townshend?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-14 00:26:52	@Alsboringtweets Doesn't icing usually go on a yummy cake?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-16 02:31:49	@RobbyTheBrain But weren't you saying the same exact thing a couple months ago?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-15 19:51:56	@AFROandFriends Great. Just great. Assholes always know how to ruin a good thing. Thanks for all you've done and fuck that jerkoff.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-18 22:58:57	@7BOOMERESIASON Maybe he thought there were 'hawks players closer than they actually were? Not sure why he went down so easily/soon.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-18 23:14:34	Finally, this game is exciting!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-18 23:22:02	@MikeFrancesaNY Calm down, Mikey. Don't have a heart attack. We need you around to wave your hand another day.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-18 23:40:57	@ber_kett @RonandFezSXM He's probably passed out in a pool of his own vomit at the moment.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-19 00:05:32	@RonandFezSXM How, if he bet they'd get a TD in ot? Isn't that 6 right there?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-19 00:09:55	@neontaster I said the same thing myself. Such a sad state when they can't even come up with an original idea for a fucking sitcom.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-20 20:36:48	@MichelleDBeadle Damn, Leroy needs a diet and some exercise.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-21 01:28:04	@CMPunk Edgar was cool, but Allen was a dick.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-21 15:34:38	@queenelisabeth Yes, please.....
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-21 19:39:45	@afarha0122  @TBillsss Lol, what an argument. "Stop talking to me then" Wow, you really put @neontaster in his/her place.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-21 19:43:04	@afarha0122 @TBillsss @neontaster He/she is calling you stupid because that's exactly how you're coming off. You're completely uninformed.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-22 12:35:16	@TammyPescatelli You gonna be on @RonandFezSXM ?

255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-22 13:57:03	@TammyPescatelli @RonandFezSXM @JennyMcCarthy @DirtySexyFunny5 thanks, Tammy. Have a great day.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-23 14:45:25	@FredBrooklyn You didn't hear? He's really fat and ugly now.... 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-23 14:47:13	@FredBrooklyn Not sure. I'm on my second plane of the day. On my way to NOLA.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-25 23:00:06	@RobbyTheBrain Never gonna happen.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-25 23:00:36	@RobbyTheBrain The place would explode. And not in a good way.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-25 04:04:17	@BaileyJayTweets Is that the one KISS was on? Of so, then I care  whole lot.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-25 04:05:01	@Razor70 @BaileyJayTweets They were on it, but were on TV many times before that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-27 13:22:46	@AmyMek @JosephCumia They should be hunted down and impaled on a stake, and shown to the world what happens to traitors.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-27 16:05:51	@LinzBella Don't worry, I'll be home soon enough. Flight was cancelled, but I'm flying in tomorrow. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-27 22:02:34	@WWEWhatIf @RobbyTheBrain You mean like last year, when they actually did?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-26 16:14:26	@FredBrooklyn Lucky bastard. I'm stuck in New Orleans until Wednesday. Flight tomorrow has already been cancelled. 😠😠😠
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-26 16:17:08	@FredBrooklyn No snow, but no green either. Have an eighth of White Wizard sitting at home waiting for me. 😠😬😠😬
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-26 21:22:19	@LinzBella Like they weren't driving that way beforehand..... 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-28 15:45:45	@sabbathfans Christ, we're getting old.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-28 15:54:03	@LizSetsFire Vic is not funny. He laughs too hard at himself and he's a complete prick on top of it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-01-28 19:16:36	@THENYGENERAL1 Same here, but it's a good pain.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-02-05 03:08:24	@TheOnlySherrod What show?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-02-05 22:44:27	@Harlequinncy @OpieandJimmy Don't forget swim walking and self heating soup.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-02-11 23:37:51	@OpieRadio @JimNorton You guys knocked it outta the park today, man. Stuttering John was great.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-02-12 00:27:40	@BMonzoWFAN @WWENXT Last one was the best ppv in years.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-02-18 23:57:05	@GBRIELGRY Waiting for any and all Star Wars info you might want to share. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-02-19 00:01:40	@GBRIELGRY Completely understand, but I like the little production tidbits.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-02-25 15:49:28	@AFROandFriends Short show today?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-02-25 15:59:03	@AFROandFriends Thanks man. Just saw the post on Twitter and didn't read the recap yet.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-02-27 14:55:59	@THENYGENERAL1 Has Opie or Jim ever commented on the situation other than saying what Faggy Boy said? He seems to be persona non grata now.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-02-27 15:02:44	@THENYGENERAL1 LOLOLOL!!! He has the body of a chubby 14 year old girl.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-10 01:16:54	@aubreysitterson Why does anyone care if Brock doesn't show up. When he does, he just stands there anyway.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-10 21:58:40	@RadioAdrian1 Eww. I feel kinda sick after watching that. 😳
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-11 00:26:14	Christ, listening to today's @OpieandJimmy, Ester Ku is fucking annoying as fuck.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-11 00:55:17	@TheOnlySherrod Just about to watch it. So far, love this show.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-11 00:59:55	@OpieandJimmy @RadioAdrian1 He'll be a legend with herpes.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-11 02:39:03	@TheOnlySherrod Damn man, you weren't kidding. Fantastic episode.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-12 02:05:35	@aubreysitterson Hey, it's better than prepping a bull at least. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-12 02:06:33	@xomaryjeanxo Please move that hand, girl.....
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-13 19:11:02	@CarlaFinch  Seriously, what's up with the Centaur?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-16 18:40:18	@MikeFrancesaNY Are yuh gonna miss da snowblowah?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-16 21:11:47	@MikeFrancesaNY Do you mean constantly coughing or dropping dead?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-16 22:54:43	@CanadianBdog Agreed. I used twicca for the longest time, but switched to the native a few months ago.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-16 22:57:02	@FredBrooklyn What a surprise.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-16 22:59:18	@FredBrooklyn I guessed the race correctly.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-19 23:22:52	@BShopWindow I've had my 2012 for a few years now. May be time to snag a new one. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-17 23:02:34	@TheOnlySherrod If you don't pull a Herman type promo, I'll have to unfilled you.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-21 15:56:58	@ATTCares You're behind with Android 5.0 release. You were behind with 4.4.4 release. When contract is up, I'm out. Horrible service.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-21 16:06:21	@ATTCares Face it, your company dropped the ball.....yet again.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-21 16:11:28	@ATTCares You don't need my account info. Your obscenely late 4.4.4 still had a good deal of bugs, but plenty of bloatware.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-23 00:16:33	@DanSoder @flotationphilly @GaryVider Was this the guy that called into @RonandFezSXM ?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-26 04:37:20	@ChipChipperson @TheKendraS Fawk yeah!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-27 13:43:30	@985TheSportsHub @WFAN660 Arod, Clemens, Bonds and many more have never failed a test either, Big Dopey.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-29 13:53:09	@FredBrooklyn Is that a Kanger AeroTank I see?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-29 01:28:32	@TheOnlySherrod Now that would be something to see!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-29 21:30:41	@BMonzoWFAN Getting ready!!! http://t.co/oS1lprwDc1
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-29 21:46:01	@sportsnut215 @BMonzoWFAN You're observant. It is. But daddy gets to enjoy it too, no?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-29 22:15:07	So far, this tag match is kicking all sorts of ass!!!!!  #WM31
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-29 22:17:49	@TheOnlySherrod If that match was any indication of what we're in for tonight, this will be a stellar WM!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-30 00:26:07	@erockradio Only the greatest thing ever!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-30 17:30:59	@Hitomi_official @Scoreland Will it be uncensored?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-30 03:00:24	@BMonzoWFAN I gotta admit, this was a damn good Mania!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-30 03:00:58	@TheOnlySherrod This was an AWESOME Mania!!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-30 03:02:13	@RobbyTheBrain This turned out to be an excellent Mania!!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-31 00:36:21	@TheOnlySherrod The return of Sheamus the super heel....
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-03-31 00:39:29	@RobbyTheBrain He'll be good as long as stays a super heel.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-02 02:17:24	@TheOnlySherrod One or 360?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-02 02:18:26	@CarlaFinch @OpieRadio @ScottyDoo110 That would be truly epic,but I don't know, I'm not sold on this. I smell bit. 😮
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-02 02:19:32	@TheOnlySherrod Nice!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-01 19:48:34	@FredBrooklyn Potheads will ALWAYS figure out a way....
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-03 12:07:54	@queenelisabeth Any idea what was dumped during R+F yesterday when fezzy mentioned Opie popping champagne bottles when ant got fired?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-03 12:10:17	@queenelisabeth No disrespect, but why do you still listen if you don't like it? Or is just one facet you don't like?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-03 12:12:50	Am I the only who completely hates when Mike Bocchetti is on the radio? Not funny in the slightest.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-03 12:17:30	@FredBrooklyn I'm in the car for most of the day doing service calls. I love holidays, all the assholes are home.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-03 12:18:38	@queenelisabeth Even if Ron stays and does something new?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-03 12:20:54	@queenelisabeth I enjoy Bennington, but I'm not sure I could deal with an entire week of it. Hope he gets ESD, but that's wishful thinking.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-03 12:27:41	@queenelisabeth Of this really is the end of R+F, I will be honestly heartbroken. Been listening since the .com days.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-03 12:32:46	@RonandFezSXM Don't make me sad, you wouldn't like me when I'm sad. I tend to blubber and curse. http://t.co/rGYclZFJPq
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-03 14:15:03	@queenelisabeth I don't get why peeps like him on the air. Boring and unfunny.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-03 14:22:25	@GBRIELGRY I can't wait. Even though I'm on the east coast, I'm super excited.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-03 14:24:42	@AFROandFriends They're done already?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-03 18:40:11	Won't be listening until later, but been on board since the .com days. BACH 3644. I'll miss the buddays. 😢 @RonandFezSXM
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-03 18:40:45	@RonandFezSXM Can we get a "seeya"  from Fezzy?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-05 12:28:12	@MikeSchism @queenelisabeth Said the guy with an imaginary father in the sky.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-05 12:30:55	@BaileyJayTweets That looks fucking hideous.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-05 12:59:14	@CarlaFinch Said a lot of people over the last 15 years.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-04 09:20:58	@Bitterchick @BillTetley @RonandFezSXM I hope so. http://t.co/AEYNAAd7Q8
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-05 13:48:50	@ChipChipperson @notsam You'd like to suck those juicy balls, wouldn't ya Chippah? Hashtag mo.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-04 18:15:47	@GBRIELGRY A little late for April fools jokes, isn't it? 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-05 23:12:32	@THENYGENERAL1 Fuck you, Jo-boo.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-05 23:14:42	@THENYGENERAL1 I can't even get the spelling correct when it's right in front of me. #DumbCuntIAm
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-06 12:10:24	@THENYGENERAL1 Threw up in my mouth at the gym yesterday after easter dinner. Kept it in and swallowed. #AintNoBitch
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-06 12:52:35	@THENYGENERAL1 Yesterday was Italian sausage, meatballs and lasagna.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-03 02:35:09	What was dumped out when Fez started talking about Opie popping a bottle of champagne when he lost his partner? #ronandfez
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-08 00:01:51	@ScottSteiner @RobbyTheBrain Aww, it must be sad to be a bitter little girl.  You couldn't hold Hogan's jock.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-08 01:42:01	@SuperLineman78 @THENYGENERAL1 Rudest fucking twats on the planet.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-08 01:47:53	@THENYGENERAL1 @SuperLineman78 Israeli Jews don't like those funny hat wearing schmucks either. Don't like sand monkeys.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-06 21:42:00	@AFROandFriends What about today's Cumia Show?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-06 22:01:41	@AFROandFriends sorry man, didn't know that.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-07 12:33:17	@ToniMarano @THENYGENERAL1 Christ on a pony, I have to wait to listen. Is it that cringe-inducing?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-07 12:34:20	@THENYGENERAL1 @ToniMarano Getting stoned before work and will listen when it's "available".
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-07 12:41:17	@THENYGENERAL1 Syndication underground is alive and well. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-07 00:17:23	@aubreysitterson He's having a really rough night and it's only 8:17.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-07 00:31:52	@RobbyTheBrain Absolutely, but her association with Punk might hinder it a bit.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-07 01:02:06	@AFROandFriends What's with the change of plans? Not that I mind whatsoever. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-07 13:51:34	@FredBrooklyn That bad still? I can't listen to any of this "joy" until later.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-07 14:41:50	Gotta admit, the opening song is pretty funny today.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-07 17:43:20	@ber_kett @RonandFezSXM It was pure magic. http://t.co/u0MdmDthx2
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-09 02:19:29	@Zellyanks While it's a nice place, baseball's cathedral is no longer standing.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-07 18:35:41	Wait a second, I thought Fez retired? What the fuck am I listening to?  Am I about to hear a famous amos cookie commercial?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-07 18:38:24	@neontaster Dang. You're right!  But still, this is ridiculous.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-07 18:43:56	@neontaster @starwars At the very least, put the original musical numbers in Return of the Jedi.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-07 18:53:20	@THENYGENERAL1 What chu mean, foo? http://t.co/iF5wbf7hgd
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-07 19:04:57	@THENYGENERAL1 IPhone or Android? http://t.co/oHvTYJnlEy
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-07 19:10:20	@THENYGENERAL1 That's the problem, right there. http://t.co/yRL2JcXKN1
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-09 03:17:14	@MrNailsin @JosephCumia @JosephCumiaShow Lol, is that the Legion Of Doom headquarters in the background? AWESOME!!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-10 18:58:18	@RonandFezSXM B.A.C.H. 3644! I'll miss my buddies. 😢 #SeeYa! #GoodbyeRonandFez http://t.co/Tb7iiAlZv1
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-09 16:56:42	@CarlaFinch @sarahmcpants Just had a yummy chicken burrito for lunch. I love you, Chipotle.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-09 17:52:18	@ChipChipperson Made them green with envy or sumptin?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-12 23:06:47	@GBRIELGRY Any idea what's in store?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-14 02:36:06	Three minutes in, and this match is kicking serious ass! #NevilleVsZiggler #RAW
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-14 02:40:51	Goddamn, this match is killing it!!!! 
#NevilleVsZiggler #RAW
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-14 02:43:13	So is Neville a heel, face or mercenary? Either way, he's doing a fantastic job! #RAW
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-14 02:46:08	So I guess no Finn Balor tonight? #RAW
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-15 01:45:35	@BaileyJayTweets Might????
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-16 03:54:19	@aubreysitterson Lucky Bastardo!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-16 14:31:24	@FredBrooklyn Jack Herer and White Widow this morning. 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-16 15:14:53	@BMonzoWFAN Congrats!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-16 18:12:45	@neontaster Already have, my man.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-16 18:14:00	@neontaster Gotta say, it looks awesome on stage like that!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-16 19:27:31	@erockradio Damn Erock, awesome lineup!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-16 23:10:04	@OpieRadio @NYRangers @MediocreSausage But don't ya want to see the Icelanders face them in the next round?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-16 23:10:34	@JoeandEvan Was that taken just now? Holy smokes!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-17 01:40:55	@infosecnj As long as the wheels touched down the way they were supposed to. 😊
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-17 03:42:03	@GBRIELGRY Ok, so when is the full trailer coming out? 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-17 03:43:59	@neontaster It's truly amazing. I kinda thought it was BS that he was an actual droid, but when he rolled out on stage, I was stunned.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-17 03:46:57	@BGibbles @neontaster It absolutely is the exact same audio. "You have that power too" was cut and pasted from earlier in his conversation.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-17 14:05:42	@neontaster What's that?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-18 21:40:12	@FredBrooklyn And here I just thought the left out an "L"......
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-18 23:11:13	@CanadianBdog Only one? Con's set yourself lucky. One place I lived, I had 3 neighbors I couldn't stand.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-19 12:48:27	@GBRIELGRY How so? Just a hint???
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-19 14:38:04	@neontaster Still, a smart and very bold move by him.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-20 21:40:44	@FredBrooklyn Some guy named kemal or something like that. One of them said it and they never bright the name up again.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-19 20:05:18	@FredBrooklyn I'm thinking about mixing a batch at home. Are those nicotine or another "substance"?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-19 20:10:27	@FredBrooklyn Damn, I need to get a hold of some of those.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-20 13:36:25	@BoomerandCarton Did the Commissioner just mess up Craig's name multiple times?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-21 00:06:33	@RobbyTheBrain If true, that's fucking stupid.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-22 00:25:10	@cc660 Please tell us what dll is.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-22 01:31:26	@JimNorton Any diet will work if YOU want it to, James. #TweetsFromABigMo
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-22 02:36:21	@Zellyanks Was a bit of a nail-biter at the end, but he pulled it out.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-22 02:37:38	@OpieRadio @jsimpsonDC It's making me get outta breath, and I'm not a fan of either team. Playoff hockey rules!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-22 14:53:23	@rickygervais Great, but why did you remove his chin?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-25 01:46:58	@MalcolmFlexx @MentalityMag Religion of peace, right?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-25 14:01:17	@BMonzoWFAN Kinda messy that way, no?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-25 14:02:41	@BaileyJayTweets Totally serious question. If he's now a she but still likes women, does that make him straight?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-24 15:47:30	@discordianslip I loved them when I was younger &amp; when I bought the set for my son a couple years ago I was disappointed in the new artwork.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-28 17:48:15	@JonHeymanCBS Thanks for putting this out there, Jon. ☺
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-28 17:50:23	@sarahmcpants @BenningtonShow The mere fact that there's a cop avocado on the show makes me love it.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-28 18:02:01	@sarahmcpants @BenningtonShow @pattonoswalt My son is in love w/ the fact that there's a Dr. Poo Poo action figure. http://t.co/8E7kIRtIrI
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-28 18:05:33	@GBRIELGRY Boy, you weren't kidding when you posted the clip from Raiders Of The Lost Ark after Celebration ended. #RadioSilence
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-04-29 11:35:41	@FredBrooklyn Dads? And all this time I thought they were conceived like Anakin Skywalker. #VirginBirf
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-03 22:34:24	@chrisrock @Sherrod_Small Chris, you're out of your goddamn mind.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-07 23:49:50	@PatFrmMoonachie Looks like he spent a shitload of money in the accessory section of AutoZone.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-08 00:10:17	@JamesStubs @rickygervais @marknroolane1 Not funny....HILARIOUS!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-11 19:15:55	@AFROandFriends Wow, did you send it in, or did someone pull a dick move?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-11 19:18:41	@AFROandFriends Tell that to Nike if you want to use "the swoosh" 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-11 19:25:55	@devincf @Gigglemittens Neither was Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown. What's your point?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-12 00:40:50	@aubreysitterson Certainly seems that way.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-12 00:42:45	@iamcolinquinn On your knees in front of a glory hole?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-12 02:35:32	Did Darren Young just start singing, "I'm an ass man"?  #RAW
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-12 02:36:31	@TheLisaSparxxx No one hotter, Lisa!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-12 02:41:39	@aubreysitterson When the matches are overshadowed by the promos, someone is doing something wrong.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-10 19:42:40	@TheIBang He kinda comes off as a bit of a dick, but that's nothing new.  He's always been a grump.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-15 15:58:42	@BaileyJayTweets Heck yeah!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-17 16:01:03	@BlackSabbath Still pretending Bill wasn't a part of the band back then? Bill and Sabbath are both being petty and shitty.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-17 13:47:47	@rickygervais @zijra Silly Ricky, Jesus is about as real as Superman.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-17 13:51:06	@MentalityMag They should have left her there.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-17 17:55:58	@BaileyJayTweets How did George get top billing above the great Marcia Brady? #HeSuckedTheDirectorsCock
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-18 02:17:10	Dat don't make no sense!!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-19 11:45:22	@Troyquan @greenguy89 @clutchofficial I saw them for the first time in '93 and many many times since. One of the all time great live bands.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-20 01:20:44	@JoeandEvan That is, if Joe B isn't admitted to Bellevue by then.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-20 00:07:49	@BaileyJayTweets @OldYorkmatt I'd love to take that picture....
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-21 02:09:59	@TripleH From one Paul to another, you guys knocked it out of the park............. Again. Thank you.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-21 02:14:25	@TheOnlySherrod Sure as hell was, Sherrod.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-21 02:15:04	@kpaq00 @TheOnlySherrod They don't fuck around.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-20 17:39:22	@KatieLinendoll @notsam @FightOwensFight Listened first thing this morning. Great job as always, gang!!
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-22 20:53:26	@LizSetsFire if you're talking about the most recent one, I was cringing so bad. He buried her at every turn.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-21 23:40:07	@erockradio Doesn't seem like you liked it. Bums me out because I'm really excited to see it. 😳
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-21 23:50:08	@rickygervais You don't know how hard that line cut me when I saw that episode. #ScaredAndLazyMyEntireLife
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-22 20:58:37	@LizSetsFire I was literally wincing while driving and listening to it yesterday. It was fantastic.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-27 02:25:50	@BMonzoWFAN It's turning into a thorough beating at this point....
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-29 01:34:15	@Breaking911 @neontaster Guess they had a "little" beef? 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-30 13:09:59	@GBRIELGRY Any time frame?
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-05-31 14:59:59	@TaheraHAhmad @united @ImamSuhaibWebb I'm not sure what the big deal is. I've been denied the same thing many times before. It's policy.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-06-03 01:05:31	@BaileyJayTweets A real doll indeed.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-06-09 00:46:00	@RobbyTheBrain Saxton stinks. Should've just had JBL and Cole handle the announcing.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-06-10 16:30:23	@GBRIELGRY Any hints as to what we could expect? 😉
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-06-10 16:40:47	@GailAaann Every damn day.... 😃
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-06-10 16:48:32	@GBRIELGRY I knew that, silly. Just wondering what about it.... 😃
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-06-12 00:10:08	@wbfletcher That new single kicks ass.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-06-15 01:01:23	@WWE Lame and predictable.
255161667	fredrogers75	2015-06-17 13:48:50	@BoomerandCarton Craig first question was incorrect. He asked for 4 fried chickens, not half a fried chicken.
