255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-08 02:35:28	When you assess all the cool shit going on in your life it really makes you feel good about yourself and forget whatever you got going on

255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-10 01:50:00	Like old Chicago (the place where omikoshi used to be) is good and all but omikoshi's food was fucking fire compared to old Chicago
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-10 03:12:42	Y'all fuckers thought I was full of shit #whatnow #obamaatefoodfrommyrestaurant http://t.co/wFjmYXMWiX

255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-13 17:46:06	Friday was pretty great
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-13 19:46:38	Gym everyday for the next 3 weeks with my brother, it's gonna be a bitch but all worth it
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-13 21:20:10	I'm bored but I'm too lazy to do anything even if I wanted to, like I'm even too lazy to text right now Idk why
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-16 04:51:43	Do we take one exam per day this week or 2 I forgot
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-16 02:55:50	Martin scorsese, Stanley kubric, Quentin tarantino and wes Anderson movies would be the ideal gift for me
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-16 21:45:52	@halleyfranklin0 passed my bio exam because I copied entirely off the smartest kid in class
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-16 12:59:03	Time to spend the next 3 hours guessing at random and seeing how it fucks Me over
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-17 04:16:32	Legitimately just woke up from a nightmare where I was taking the bio exam again and that shit was scary
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-17 15:38:56	Somebody call an ambulance, I just knocked out my history exam

255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-20 05:53:35	So today ended terribly and I feel like shit now
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-18 01:24:31	Holy shit they've actually done it, they've pulled "the interview"  from theatres all over the country due to threats from North Korea
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-18 01:28:09	Like I get that if there's a threat (legitimate or not) that you should take caution but all this over a fucking comedy by seth rogan
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-18 01:30:15	Imagine how ridiculous it'd be going to war because James Franco and seth rogan decided to make a comedy
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-18 02:51:25	Oculus rift and nimble vr are making all those sci-fi movies a reality and it's kinda scary how advanced tech is getting

255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-22 07:21:18	"@CHlLDHOODRUINER: Life where I live 😂 http://t.co/Q1TcFouE2y" fucking Franklin Tennessee weather

255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-21 21:27:22	Dad fell asleep watching Netflix and he woke up and rewinded it since he missed a part, then fell asleep and repeated the same thing over
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-24 01:49:19	My mom likes to put small presents in big boxes to get our hopes up and see our joy fade as soon as it's not what we expected
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-24 02:17:06	Oh shit the movie the interview is actually gonna be screening on Christmas day, and at the Franklin theatre #shoutout to those people
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-25 05:03:46	Blow me North Korea, guess who's watching the interview on Christmas eve #TheInterview #fuckyoukimjungun http://t.co/dzUmzaTprd
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-27 05:21:53	Just to be specific I watched "Heat" with Robert deniro , not "the heat" with Sandra bullock I fucking hate that movie
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-27 02:19:42	@AllieGraceRist he understood all the rage about ass years before everyone else did, he was foretelling the future
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-27 06:48:59	@CHlLDHOODRUINER @justinkievit does this happen at white people reunions
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-24 20:32:38	My sister:I swear if you ruin Christmas again by unwrapping all the presents then seeing what you got and rewrapping them I'll kill you
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-24 20:33:38	Today sucks for me because if you know me, I'm the most inpatient person on this planet and having  to wait to receive gifts is even worse
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-27 04:50:34	Watched "Heat", all in can say is it's fucking amazing if you like crime dramas
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-28 06:49:49	@willriddle21 Haha I know, it's driving me crazy trying to find it
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-27 20:50:53	Having friends with jobs blows, because now I ain't got shit to do
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-27 20:54:58	Someone please help me find the name of this remix, it's 3005 by childish Gambino but Idk who made this remix  https://t.co/mVyExBKiXF
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-29 08:27:00	@natnatphilips that's the funniest thing I've seen on twitter all year
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-29 21:27:04	"that song just set back black people" - my friend after we heard some really nonsensical chief keef song

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-02 09:19:20	Watching that 70's show and red foreman is literally a perfect example of what my dad is like towards me
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-02 11:03:22	One thing that pisses me off more than anything is when someone borrows a movie from my collection without asking
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-01 22:57:58	Earl sweatshirt is my shit right now yo
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-01 23:06:17	Wutang clan ain't nothing to fuck with but this song definitely is http://t.co/otmNbBBkwG

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-06 03:34:44	It's funny how in the 90's a million dollars would have had you set for life but I  today's world a million could only do you so much
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-05 06:08:54	Stake and shake at 12 is great
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-07 20:48:33	I'm wearing shorts and it's freezing
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-08 15:29:58	I swear if this stupid broken fire alarm is the reason we gotta stand outside in the cold
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-08 15:31:06	Looney is probably chillin at home watching Netflix with a warm blanket laughing at all these hate tweets
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-08 17:33:11	Today is pretty much everyone from wilco hate on Dr.looney day

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-09 08:09:44	The sadness in my heart knowing that I can't go to bonaroo and seeing the amazing line up this year
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-09 15:27:27	@SeymourBrandon7 creepin in my snapchat story http://t.co/fcC9DXh2MH
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-11 00:20:57	My own reflection just scared the shit out of me, what's wrong with me
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-11 22:20:15	Interstellar is a fucking master piece
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-12 00:06:19	You don't understand how much that last thing I retweeted made me laugh
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-11 19:25:04	I spend alot of time watching movies, helps me unwind and just enjoy some good films

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-13 03:21:58	Thank the Chinese for their delicious ass food I just found in my fridge
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-12 16:41:58	Everyone at chs has to do this  https://t.co/MTmyyvMvbk
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-14 03:17:19	Bonaroo's line up has me feeling depressed because I can't go, especially when kendrick lamar and childish Gambino are performing
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-14 03:27:50	@EmilyLovgren @justin_kievit this is for real, I've accidentally bitten food shaped candles before
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-14 03:32:01	@jr_arredondo43 parents won't let me, and I ain't got that kinda cash for tickets, at least for now
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-14 03:36:53	Friday can not come quick enough

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-14 14:34:06	Quite surprised he responded for once http://t.co/gOhBubnlUp
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-14 23:53:47	Bonaroo might just actually be a possibility this year, as long as I work my ass off for the money to get my ticket
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-16 01:31:01	Vice documentaries are interesting as hell
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-16 01:47:09	I remember back when wcw was the name of a Saturday night wrestling TV show, now it's woman crush Wednesday
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-16 02:05:01	Road to El Dorado is on Netflix incase there's anyone who loves that movie as much as I do
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-14 18:44:09	This poor girl decided to eat lunch outside to protest Looney's decision for school today, she is #relentless http://t.co/zIRXmam1SR

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-15 02:35:37	Even though Dr.looney still called for school today, he's just a hard working guy and he doesn't deserve most the hate he gets
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-18 05:53:41	The fact that nic cage has won an oscar and Leonardo Dicaprio hasn't fucking baffles me, one was in ghost Rider and the other in titanic #?
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-18 06:50:05	@AllieGraceRist well is it possible?
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-19 01:33:43	There's not the same feeling to classic shows anymore, sure you can watch it on Netflix but imagine what it was like waiting a week per ep
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-19 02:27:00	Kids nowadays are used to having most their interactions be through screens on social networks being dictated by numbers
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-19 02:28:03	I remember when cell phones were barely just a thing, having to walk a mile to my friend's just to see if he Could come out and play
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-18 02:20:51	Watched American sniper,absolutely powerful film,it left the theatre quiet in its end due to utter respect to those who protect this country
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-18 05:33:52	It really blows whenever you wanna text someone but don't want to seem annoying
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-20 15:10:27	@EmilyLovgren clearly he's got his priorities in check
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-21 04:37:17	Just watched whiplash and holy shit it was exciting, really shows you the lengths people will go to be the best at what they do

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-21 22:13:34	I swear if "the theory of everything" wins an oscar for best picture over birdman and whiplash, I will riot
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-21 22:43:34	As long as J.k. Simmons wins best supporting actor then I'll be happy because whiplash is a great film and deserves all the praise it gets
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-22 04:37:48	School is not something I'm looking forward to going back to
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-22 04:41:16	Like for hdm
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 05:03:47	@jr_arredondo43  Yeah but compared to the tour de force performance by Michael Keaton though? I'm not too sure
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 05:06:57	@jr_arredondo43 Yeah I know that,trust me I consider every little thing when it comes to which films deserve awards, and birdman deserved it
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-22 21:19:23	@CHlLDHOODRUINER @justin_kievit Idk why, but I feel like you're the type of guy to do this when you're alone

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 01:46:11	BOOM bitch I fucking knew jk Simmons was gonna win the oscar for best supporting actor, his role in whiplash was too good for him not to win
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:02:31	Grand Budapest hotel rightfully deserves all the awards it racks up tonight
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:08:32	Love how the 50 shades of grey cast is just chillin next to a-list actors, even though their movie was an awful train wreck
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:10:54	How old is nicole kidman, like 40 or 50? She still a dime though
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:13:48	Wow what fucking assholes, the winner of ida was giving a heartfelt speech about his family and these fuckers played the wrap up music
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:22:47	Why is it always during award shows or sport events that commercials go from regular to seeming like they were directed while on lsd
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:28:15	The theory of everything?, more like the theory of Oscar bait
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:32:18	Did they really just played wrap up music when this lady was talking about her son who committed suicide...Kinda want to smack the sound guy
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:47:28	Whiplash won for sound, as expected
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-24 13:41:52	Woke up extremely disoriented because I stayed up late and just had someone take me to school because I couldn't function to get on the bus
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:55:31	Patricia arquette beat meryl streep out of an oscar, dear Lord I'm speechless
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 03:51:33	I'm trying my hardest to be a better person and a role model to my younger brother each and every day
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 03:56:25	Kinda funny how things change really easily
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 04:03:41	The musical performance by common and John Legend at the Oscars was incredible really moving too
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 04:05:35	John Travolta is still relevant?
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 04:10:06	Never understood how much more than just a film selma is, the people behind it really have made it a remarkable ode to mlk's legacy and work
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-22 19:23:21	It makes me very happy knowing that we won't have school tomorrow

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-22 20:08:12	I'm gonna be 16 in exactly one month and that scares me because I'm supposed to know how to do things yet I struggle making mac and cheese
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-22 20:23:53	From what I know about films, 99% of live action films based off of things that weren't meant to be live action, usually really suck
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-22 21:10:52	Another year where Leonardo Dicaprio will attend the Oscars only to leave with a napkin full of his own tears #Oscars2015
