255694237	CrisCringles	2014-10-06 00:02:09	That sad moment when something important to you falls in the crevice of no return on the side of your bed and you're to lazy to get it

255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-08 02:35:28	When you assess all the cool shit going on in your life it really makes you feel good about yourself and forget whatever you got going on

255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-10 01:50:00	Like old Chicago (the place where omikoshi used to be) is good and all but omikoshi's food was fucking fire compared to old Chicago

255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-13 17:46:06	Friday was pretty great
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-13 19:46:38	Gym everyday for the next 3 weeks with my brother, it's gonna be a bitch but all worth it
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-13 21:20:10	I'm bored but I'm too lazy to do anything even if I wanted to, like I'm even too lazy to text right now Idk why
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-16 04:51:43	Do we take one exam per day this week or 2 I forgot
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-16 02:55:50	Martin scorsese, Stanley kubric, Quentin tarantino and wes Anderson movies would be the ideal gift for me
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-16 21:45:52	@halleyfranklin0 passed my bio exam because I copied entirely off the smartest kid in class
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-16 12:59:03	Time to spend the next 3 hours guessing at random and seeing how it fucks Me over
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-17 04:16:32	Legitimately just woke up from a nightmare where I was taking the bio exam again and that shit was scary

255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-20 05:53:35	So today ended terribly and I feel like shit now
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-18 01:24:31	Holy shit they've actually done it, they've pulled "the interview"  from theatres all over the country due to threats from North Korea
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-18 01:28:09	Like I get that if there's a threat (legitimate or not) that you should take caution but all this over a fucking comedy by seth rogan
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-18 01:30:15	Imagine how ridiculous it'd be going to war because James Franco and seth rogan decided to make a comedy
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-18 02:51:25	Oculus rift and nimble vr are making all those sci-fi movies a reality and it's kinda scary how advanced tech is getting

255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-21 21:27:22	Dad fell asleep watching Netflix and he woke up and rewinded it since he missed a part, then fell asleep and repeated the same thing over
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-24 01:49:19	My mom likes to put small presents in big boxes to get our hopes up and see our joy fade as soon as it's not what we expected
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-24 02:17:06	Oh shit the movie the interview is actually gonna be screening on Christmas day, and at the Franklin theatre #shoutout to those people
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-25 05:03:46	Blow me North Korea, guess who's watching the interview on Christmas eve #TheInterview #fuckyoukimjungun http://t.co/dzUmzaTprd
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-27 05:21:53	Just to be specific I watched "Heat" with Robert deniro , not "the heat" with Sandra bullock I fucking hate that movie
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-27 02:19:42	@AllieGraceRist he understood all the rage about ass years before everyone else did, he was foretelling the future
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-27 06:48:59	@CHlLDHOODRUINER @justinkievit does this happen at white people reunions
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-24 20:32:38	My sister:I swear if you ruin Christmas again by unwrapping all the presents then seeing what you got and rewrapping them I'll kill you
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-24 20:33:38	Today sucks for me because if you know me, I'm the most inpatient person on this planet and having  to wait to receive gifts is even worse
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-27 04:50:34	Watched "Heat", all in can say is it's fucking amazing if you like crime dramas
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-28 06:49:49	@willriddle21 Haha I know, it's driving me crazy trying to find it
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-27 20:50:53	Having friends with jobs blows, because now I ain't got shit to do
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-27 20:54:58	Someone please help me find the name of this remix, it's 3005 by childish Gambino but Idk who made this remix  https://t.co/mVyExBKiXF
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-29 08:27:00	@natnatphilips that's the funniest thing I've seen on twitter all year
255694237	CrisCringles	2014-12-29 21:27:04	"that song just set back black people" - my friend after we heard some really nonsensical chief keef song

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-02 09:19:20	Watching that 70's show and red foreman is literally a perfect example of what my dad is like towards me
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-02 11:03:22	One thing that pisses me off more than anything is when someone borrows a movie from my collection without asking
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-01 22:57:58	Earl sweatshirt is my shit right now yo
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-01 23:06:17	Wutang clan ain't nothing to fuck with but this song definitely is http://t.co/otmNbBBkwG

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-06 03:34:44	It's funny how in the 90's a million dollars would have had you set for life but I  today's world a million could only do you so much
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-05 06:08:54	Stake and shake at 12 is great
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-07 20:48:33	I'm wearing shorts and it's freezing
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-08 15:29:58	I swear if this stupid broken fire alarm is the reason we gotta stand outside in the cold
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-08 15:31:06	Looney is probably chillin at home watching Netflix with a warm blanket laughing at all these hate tweets
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-08 17:33:11	Today is pretty much everyone from wilco hate on Dr.looney day

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-09 08:09:44	The sadness in my heart knowing that I can't go to bonaroo and seeing the amazing line up this year
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-09 15:27:27	@SeymourBrandon7 creepin in my snapchat story http://t.co/fcC9DXh2MH
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-11 00:20:57	My own reflection just scared the shit out of me, what's wrong with me
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-11 22:20:15	Interstellar is a fucking master piece
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-12 00:06:19	You don't understand how much that last thing I retweeted made me laugh
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-11 19:25:04	I spend alot of time watching movies, helps me unwind and just enjoy some good films

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-13 03:21:58	Thank the Chinese for their delicious ass food I just found in my fridge
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-12 16:41:58	Everyone at chs has to do this  https://t.co/MTmyyvMvbk
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-14 03:17:19	Bonaroo's line up has me feeling depressed because I can't go, especially when kendrick lamar and childish Gambino are performing
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-14 03:27:50	@EmilyLovgren @justin_kievit this is for real, I've accidentally bitten food shaped candles before
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-14 03:32:01	@jr_arredondo43 parents won't let me, and I ain't got that kinda cash for tickets, at least for now
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-14 03:36:53	Friday can not come quick enough
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-14 13:37:21	@wcsDirofSchools I hope you know I don't own a snow mobile
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-14 14:34:06	Quite surprised he responded for once http://t.co/gOhBubnlUp
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-14 23:53:47	Bonaroo might just actually be a possibility this year, as long as I work my ass off for the money to get my ticket
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-16 01:31:01	Vice documentaries are interesting as hell
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-16 01:47:09	I remember back when wcw was the name of a Saturday night wrestling TV show, now it's woman crush Wednesday
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-16 02:05:01	Road to El Dorado is on Netflix incase there's anyone who loves that movie as much as I do
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-14 18:44:09	This poor girl decided to eat lunch outside to protest Looney's decision for school today, she is #relentless http://t.co/zIRXmam1SR

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-15 02:35:37	Even though Dr.looney still called for school today, he's just a hard working guy and he doesn't deserve most the hate he gets
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-18 05:53:41	The fact that nic cage has won an oscar and Leonardo Dicaprio hasn't fucking baffles me, one was in ghost Rider and the other in titanic #?
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-18 06:50:05	@AllieGraceRist well is it possible?
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-19 01:33:43	There's not the same feeling to classic shows anymore, sure you can watch it on Netflix but imagine what it was like waiting a week per ep
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-19 02:27:00	Kids nowadays are used to having most their interactions be through screens on social networks being dictated by numbers
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-19 02:28:03	I remember when cell phones were barely just a thing, having to walk a mile to my friend's just to see if he Could come out and play
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-18 02:20:51	Watched American sniper,absolutely powerful film,it left the theatre quiet in its end due to utter respect to those who protect this country
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-18 05:33:52	It really blows whenever you wanna text someone but don't want to seem annoying
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-01-20 15:10:27	@EmilyLovgren clearly he's got his priorities in check

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-21 22:13:34	I swear if "the theory of everything" wins an oscar for best picture over birdman and whiplash, I will riot
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-21 22:43:34	As long as J.k. Simmons wins best supporting actor then I'll be happy because whiplash is a great film and deserves all the praise it gets
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-22 04:37:48	School is not something I'm looking forward to going back to

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 05:06:57	@jr_arredondo43 Yeah I know that,trust me I consider every little thing when it comes to which films deserve awards, and birdman deserved it

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 01:46:11	BOOM bitch I fucking knew jk Simmons was gonna win the oscar for best supporting actor, his role in whiplash was too good for him not to win
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:02:31	Grand Budapest hotel rightfully deserves all the awards it racks up tonight
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:08:32	Love how the 50 shades of grey cast is just chillin next to a-list actors, even though their movie was an awful train wreck
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:10:54	How old is nicole kidman, like 40 or 50? She still a dime though
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:13:48	Wow what fucking assholes, the winner of ida was giving a heartfelt speech about his family and these fuckers played the wrap up music
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:22:47	Why is it always during award shows or sport events that commercials go from regular to seeming like they were directed while on lsd
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:28:15	The theory of everything?, more like the theory of Oscar bait
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:32:18	Did they really just played wrap up music when this lady was talking about her son who committed suicide...Kinda want to smack the sound guy
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 02:47:28	Whiplash won for sound, as expected
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-24 13:41:52	Woke up extremely disoriented because I stayed up late and just had someone take me to school because I couldn't function to get on the bus

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 03:56:25	Kinda funny how things change really easily
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 04:03:41	The musical performance by common and John Legend at the Oscars was incredible really moving too
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 04:05:35	John Travolta is still relevant?
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-23 04:10:06	Never understood how much more than just a film selma is, the people behind it really have made it a remarkable ode to mlk's legacy and work
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-22 19:23:21	It makes me very happy knowing that we won't have school tomorrow

255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-22 20:23:53	From what I know about films, 99% of live action films based off of things that weren't meant to be live action, usually really suck
255694237	CrisCringles	2015-02-22 21:10:52	Another year where Leonardo Dicaprio will attend the Oscars only to leave with a napkin full of his own tears #Oscars2015
