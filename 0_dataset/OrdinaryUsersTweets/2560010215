2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-11-29 20:25:30	At least hoke is gone!
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-11-27 18:09:15	This guy is pathetic
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-11-30 00:59:12	@kevinketvir go blue forever!
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-11-30 03:41:34	This is not your typical SEC game at all!

2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-11-29 04:02:37	21 and 22 jump street with @RileyGuntrip42 üëå
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-11-29 16:47:43	If Michigan wins then the season is considered saved! #BeatOhio #GoBlue
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-01 13:16:08	Feel awful...
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-01 19:18:56	Worst time to get sick....
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 00:38:25	If Brady Hoke has a job at Michigan next year then I'm not longer a fan.
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 14:09:10	Feel like crap.....üò∑
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 01:05:37	You hit the slants and the post they will respect you, you hit this pattern they will fear you! Fav quote from FNL
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 20:29:51	Wouldn't mind for Bo Pelini to become the next defensive coordinator at Michigan or even head coach!
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 20:45:34	Getting sick of people saying we will get les or Harbaugh! Michigans program is down why would they leave where they are successful?
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 20:49:15	@Imperati_10 thank you!!! People are so dumb and think Michigan is just gonna win a title next year because of a new coach.
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 20:51:48	@Imperati_10 like honestly hoke was three time coach of the year in three different conferences! It's not just the coaching here!
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 20:53:47	@BrandonnnJ won't be either of them! Just watch! They need someone who's not a Michigan man
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 20:55:43	@BrandonnnJ which is why he wouldn't come to a terrible Michigan team! I love Michigan and all but I don't see either of them here next year
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 20:58:22	@BrandonnnJ if that was so we would have had him after Carr! No one is going to be successful with only 4 years at a school.
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 20:59:46	@BrandonnnJ this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen!
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 21:00:12	@BrandonnnJ oh fact from where Wikipedia?
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 21:02:04	@BrandonnnJ never heard of this dude so! It won't be either just watch it deff won't be Jim
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 21:03:27	@BrandonnnJ just wait you will see...
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 21:04:49	@BrandonnnJ if you're right I'll give you a dollar
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 21:06:39	@BrandonnnJ you and me both know you don't have $100
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 22:00:27	@Burkholder_Kyle @ochocinco what do we got to lose!!
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-03 02:00:29	Stop it Spike!! #GoBlue
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-03 02:30:03	If Michigan don't get the free throw game under control we are in trouble this year! This is two straight games!
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-03 02:33:34	We squeezed that one out! Did not play well at all..
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-02 20:14:26	It's official Brady Hoke is gone! Can't wait for the future of Michigan Football! #GoBlue

2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-07 20:08:07	@BrandonnnJ thats why you're the most biased person I know is because you go off of who's ranked....
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-07 20:08:51	@zackzsolcsak7 @BrandonnnJ they lose at least two games!
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-07 20:10:16	@BrandonnnJ kid you have no valid points like come on OSU almost lost to Michigan and penn state who are two of the worst team in FBS

2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-07 17:45:28	Blows my mind that you can move from 3rd team in the country to 6th by winning by 50!
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-07 17:47:47	This committee is a joke! Clearly the Big 12 is way better the the Big 10...
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-08 15:19:15	So nervous for these exams...
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-07 18:00:16	Ranking of conferences in order SEC, Big 12, Pac 12, Big 10, ACC. How does a Big 12 team not get in? Playoff is worse then the BCS already.
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-07 18:21:31	@zackzsolcsak7 how do?
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-07 18:40:11	Last rant of the day but how can you win 29 straight games and be the 3rd best team in the country?
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-07 18:42:21	@Burkholder_Kyle 29 in a row is all I have to say..
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-07 19:07:16	@zackzsolcsak7 that's the stupidest thing I've heard all day! Big 12 easy second
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-07 19:13:05	@BrandonnnJ @zackzsolcsak7 no the big ten is a joke compared to the big 12! You're a big ten fan of course your biased af
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-07 19:14:41	@BrandonnnJ it's close between those two each and every week it could go anyway
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-07 19:18:31	Finals week is gonna to kill me....
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-08 18:23:11	I hate school I hate everything about school! I hate finals I hate it! Why do I wanna be a teacher...?

2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-20 18:53:02	Michigans bigs are looking like average high school players! They are horrible
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-20 18:55:08	You shoot over 35 threes and make 7! Learn a new offense obviously it don't work! Michigan is falling off on every sport! Just terrible
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-20 18:56:44	@JohnnyWatts9 yeah when they had shooters! They don't have a go to shooter anymore! After Burke and Nick they don't have one
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-20 18:59:28	@JohnnyWatts9 I hope they can! I mean they are real young so they gotta learn to win and finish ganes

2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-21 19:03:44	Staff needs to realize the defense is good don't force it when we can get points
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-21 19:21:41	Detroit needs to learn to not beat themselves
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-21 19:23:50	Once again another's bears backup plays better then cutler has all year! When they gonna give up on him. He's a joke

2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-28 22:22:38	Stafford is a terrible QB
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-28 22:46:08	I'm a Detroit fan but that penalty was terrible
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-28 23:22:19	This is a great game

2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-31 05:43:10	Baseball is a game that I don't think I can ever give up, it is my life.
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-31 17:42:32	2014 taught me a lot about myself. Now I'm ready for what 2015 has in store for me.
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-31 18:00:33	Relating to someone is honestly the best.
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-31 18:29:08	But the SEC is all about defense they said!  TCU proving themselves yet again
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-31 19:27:10	Met some great people in 2014 that have become some of the bestfriends that I have today!
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-31 23:39:05	@_Blyons congrats bud!

2560010215	BradConnochie33	2014-12-31 23:53:07	Being second is like being last......
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-01 18:04:59	Petty for heisman!
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-01 18:07:09	@Zach_Tallman you're not on a couch

2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 05:11:58	Everything starting to fall into place
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 05:27:30	Has a big ten school lost a game this bowl season?
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 05:29:03	@dcain97 is that it?
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 05:34:44	Pass? Why?
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 05:44:27	Looks like I won't be watching the title game
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 05:45:20	Still believe the most exciting game would be TCU vs Oregon
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 05:47:53	Still think this playoff should expand to atleast 8
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 05:51:52	College football makes me wanna hurt people
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 05:53:06	Rooting for the Hawian in this one! #GoDucks
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 06:03:19	I hate when people root for Ohio that are Michigan fans who cares if they are in our conference you don't root for your rival
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 06:08:25	@Zach_Tallman false

2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-01 22:32:45	@Kale_Devries typical state fan can't even spell...
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-01 22:33:48	@ZGomola @Kale_Devries correct
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-01 22:39:21	Can't wait to be back at school playing baseball‚öæÔ∏è
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-03 05:00:02	Just now packing
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-01 05:03:03	2015 let's go
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 00:00:28	Florida state played a bad half of football and are still in this
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-01 06:21:50	@BrandonnnJ serious
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 00:48:58	This cook guy sucks
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 00:53:21	Looks like Oregon is gonna win so if that stays then I want them to win it all cuz I hate bama and that southern school
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 01:19:38	TCU would have been a good matchup for Oregon! Even though Florida state was 12-0
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 01:26:32	@Burkholder_Kyle still best ND! TCU should have been there but 12-0 couldn't take them out
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 01:29:43	@Burkholder_Kyle yes I would have rather seen that game to. Who's Michigan? New teams called Harbaugh
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 01:31:41	@Zach_Tallman just showed me his vines and he was such a queer.
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 01:47:54	Hopefully the lions draft Jameis
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 01:50:14	@zackzsolcsak7 he's a stud man proved it today
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 01:51:38	@zackzsolcsak7 he's like the next Tom Brady
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 23:03:54	@BrandonnnJ @zackzsolcsak7 says the fake Michigan fan rooting for Ohio. Remember @Zach_Tallman when Brandon said he was giving up on Mich
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-02 23:06:33	@BrandonnnJ @Zach_Tallman no because I remember you giving up on them. As well as rooting for Ohio shows your true colors and loyalty
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-03 16:34:44	Happy birthday to one of my good buddies @RileyGuntrip42 enjoy the day. #canada üçÅ

2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-03 20:39:37	Michigan is a terrible rebounding team
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-03 21:01:24	They are bad
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-03 21:04:07	Doyle is useless
2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-03 23:21:33	Did @dcain97 just tweet at himself?üòÇüòÇ

2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-01-19 05:29:52	Don't even care max is gone! No one deserves that money when military guys are getting like $30,000! Honestly pro athletes sicken me

2560010215	BradConnochie33	2015-03-23 04:59:20	@nbanks29 this is very true. Joe Nathan is towards end of his career and struggling and the relievers just suck Hopefully verlander steps up
