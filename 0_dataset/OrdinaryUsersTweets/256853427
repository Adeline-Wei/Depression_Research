256853427	rcann213	2013-06-28 01:57:48	Bill Simmons echoing exactly what I said. Bad trade for the Celtics.
256853427	rcann213	2013-06-27 18:05:45	@StoneColin no it's not. I don't want Gerald Wallace. He sucks and he makes 10 mil for the next 3 years. And they are not consecutive picks.
256853427	rcann213	2013-06-27 18:41:40	Now he can practice more and try and beat the guards. #Hernandez
256853427	rcann213	2013-06-28 03:06:02	I can't believe that Paul is really gone. This shit is unreal. Awful deal. Fucking idiot Danny. #PaulPierce #ForeverACeltic #Retire34

256853427	rcann213	2015-05-11 23:52:26	Wearing my 12 to work tomorrow over my office clothes @scottzolak. Statement.
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-12 00:01:56	@TheRealTebow3 yea and we employed a murderer what's your point? The point is the nfl suspensions are a joke. That's the point.
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-12 00:07:27	@TheRealTebow3 so why did Atlanta get a simple fine for crowd noise. That not integrity ?
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-12 00:09:10	@TheRealTebow3 so Brady maybe knew with no conclusive evidence and didn't turn over a phone means 4 games? Ha right
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-12 00:12:56	@TheRealTebow3 lol but no definitive evidence in the report. Personal cell phone. Don't care if it was to his lawyers.Ray rice was the convo
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-12 00:18:57	@TheRealTebow3 I think the nfl would have manipulated anything he gave up on that phone. Should have been 1 game. Period.
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-12 00:21:27	@TheRealTebow3 I just hate how the league just gets to make up the rule book as they go along. Idc who the team is.
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-12 00:35:36	Simple statement made. #IStandWithTom
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-14 15:25:06	Let's go! #defendthewall  https://t.co/5BGO867c98
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-18 01:56:38	Smoke https://t.co/fFfF6ibHE3
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-18 04:15:52	This dude is the craziest mother fucker https://t.co/e3RVazDCK8
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-19 17:20:30	Now that Kraft won't appeal, that had BETTER mean Brady's suspension gets knocked down. If not, we riot.
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-22 01:59:01	@TheRealGresh @JeffWood1979 guy has been peppering you with tweets. Bet his 25 followers are amused?
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-22 02:26:30	Yes, yes and yes https://t.co/4nWK6GA556
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-22 02:29:13	@HPbasketball do you think Harden is not respected enough because it's not pleasing to the eye? Feel like he has some Pierce in him no?
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-22 02:34:20	@HPbasketball I agree. Houston decent market. JH also left handed which I think is part of it. Sounds dumb but plus a part.
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-22 02:35:41	@HPbasketball lefties look dysfunctional to your casual fan. So few stars in that group.
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-21 22:07:11	Lmao so many haters https://t.co/5NlmwEqfmz
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-21 22:13:19	That guy is such a pussy. Bring up Castillo! https://t.co/vXlmZhHUvt
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-22 15:01:55	@scottzolak mase came back with a song called welcome back after his run as a preacher. So you're right. Not @KenGriffeyRules
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-25 15:55:06	@zoooky44 I told you warriors were gonna smoke them that night
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-27 01:20:44	Piff the magic dragon tho üòÇ #AGT
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-27 13:05:22	LeBron is the best basketball player in the world, but I cannot stand his post game press conferences. So full of himself. All about him.
256853427	rcann213	2015-05-28 16:19:45	Bulls are so dumb for firing Tom Thibodeau. One of@the best coaches in the league.
256853427	rcann213	2015-06-02 23:01:01	O so you're a wise guy huh? @Toucherandrich  https://t.co/PESq0r0rgV
256853427	rcann213	2015-06-03 00:04:46	Looks like option A @KenGriffeyRules
256853427	rcann213	2015-06-03 00:22:24	Clay is pitching well tonight. Get him some runs now fellas
256853427	rcann213	2015-06-03 00:24:37	@scottzolak Brady is and will always be a team guy. How many superbowls  Zo? That's why this organization is a model for everyone else
256853427	rcann213	2015-06-03 00:33:44	@scottzolak love it https://t.co/ZTKOiB141P

256853427	rcann213	2015-06-03 01:27:19	@BSO for another boring ass fight
256853427	rcann213	2015-06-03 01:31:19	@BSO wish he would fight one fight all out and not be defensive. I know it a lot to ask but I would love to see it
256853427	rcann213	2015-06-03 01:36:04	@BSO true &amp; all he cares about is preserving the undefeated streak so he will never go outside his comfort zone. If not PAC, it won't happen
256853427	rcann213	2015-06-03 01:57:18	Clay buchholz pitched a hell of a game tonight. SLOWLY earning my respect back.
256853427	rcann213	2015-06-02 12:18:51	Gronk stories on @Toucherandrich right now are absolutely killing me üòÇ
256853427	rcann213	2015-06-04 20:05:07	I guess you should be a sports reporter since you got the scoop before everyone else tmlt's @PHAT_SNAX
256853427	rcann213	2015-06-04 20:06:49	@PHAT_SNAX like I said, you beat everyone to the story. Maybe you're in the wrong career.
256853427	rcann213	2015-06-05 17:10:36	City hall is not a fun place to be. If only I was responsible and got it registered online a week ago.
256853427	rcann213	2015-06-04 15:44:05	Laughable  https://t.co/AXj4gnJzvx
