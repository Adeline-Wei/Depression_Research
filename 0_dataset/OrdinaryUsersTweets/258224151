258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-06 03:52:17	Idk why I still get excited when Abc family does a HP Weekend event when I can watch them whenever and I'm always working while they're on💁
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-06 04:02:41	@ColemanSumrall next weekend. All 8 movies. Starting Friday at 6:30pm.😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-06 19:11:06	I'm in awe by how witty 22 jump street is.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-07 21:28:57	I'm so grateful for requesting these next three days off from Disney store. I'm on the edge y'all.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-07 21:31:47	Even though it'd be amazing if I was using these days off to go to Nola like I was suppose to.....
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-08 01:13:03	@xoxoitscalio I don't normally like watches but holy shit I'm in love😍😍
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-10 05:19:59	I've decided that whether I put make up on or not I am still going to look like I'm 12, 14 max, so what's the point 💁
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-10 01:31:19	@terawaldron NO MA'AM!✋ I will move your cardboard box to Orlando if I have to!
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-10 01:38:15	@terawaldron less than two weeks😍😭 I'm so excited!!!
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-10 02:26:39	I feel like I'm cheating on my dog with my cousins puppy. I'm a pet-owners cliché. Sleeping w/ a younger one instead of w/ my loyal pup😭🙈💔
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-10 03:56:50	My sister just sent me a link to a buzzfeed article entitled "19 problems all women who love cursing know to be true" and simply said "Us".
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-10 04:06:30	“@UniversalORL: The Wizarding World of Harry Potter - #DiagonAlley is now open! http://t.co/uPoyS5wtL4” CRYING😭😭😭😭

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-11 20:58:04	It is taking me so long to finish this one book I'm kind of disappointed.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-12 03:58:04	I just beat everyone in bowling. This deserves to be documented on social media.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-12 04:34:38	Update: I won twice 💁

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-13 23:40:32	Super hot blonde girl running down airport road while I'm going to pick up my Jim N Nick order. It really put things into perspective for me
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-15 16:46:47	I swear a train could drive right through Lances' room and he wouldn't wake up.

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-16 22:03:49	My mom just said she'd pay for my voodoo fest ticket😭😍 that woman is a saint.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-14 19:55:44	The most romantic gesture I've seen in any movie is simply holding hands while they are being led into turmoil (i.e. HP DH2 and Divergent)
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-16 20:02:02	@terawaldron thanks love😘 I'll text you when I start the process💕💕

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-17 19:48:31	This panic at the disco pandora radio station is the cherry on top of an amazing day that's only just started😊
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-18 08:03:31	I'm in awe of tonight right now. What even.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-18 08:12:30	I feel like the embodiment of a Shania twain song right now.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-20 20:42:10	Is it bad that I'd rather just be hungry than actually get out of bed, put clothes on, and go get something to eat?
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-20 17:41:21	I have so much shit to do today and I'm just laying in bed watching cloudy with a chance of meatballs.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-21 03:57:51	I really hope that Penn Badgley is as charming in real life as he is in movies. That would be such a let down if he wasn't.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-21 15:50:23	I'm not even out of destin and I have already had three fits of road rage😊
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-21 05:44:49	Is it weird that I'm honestly excited to have 6 hours in a car by myself tomorrow? That's a 6 hour jam sesh that goes completely unjudged.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-18 20:55:43	If I have three friends that want to buy me a 25 dollar going away present there are Alice in Wonderland throw pillows at earthbound 💁
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-18 20:59:24	H&amp;M's sizes suck. I mean, I know I've gained some weight, but damn son not that much😳
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-18 21:18:35	@helenawhitt thank god😂 wow that makes so much more sense now.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-21 18:12:58	JUST SAW A SEMIS TIRE BLOW HOLY SHIT #shelbylivetweetsI10
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-21 18:29:25	There is now a car on fire in the middle of I-10 causing dead stand still traffic. #shelbylivetweetsI10
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-18 22:14:39	Changing in my car on the way to work while a truck full of rednecks give me thumbs up. I guess I don't have as much tint as I thought.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-22 00:27:17	@delanceyhouston I'll see you Thursday babe, and we will spend 9 glorious hours together😘

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-23 21:15:42	Pour some sugar on me does not make me a better driver. A better stipper, yes. An 80 mph strip tease is something the world isn't ready for.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-23 22:19:40	I just got the weirdest looks in this gas station and I think it has everything to do with the fact I'm not wearing a bra... Zero fucks💁
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-24 00:11:18	So many people keep trying to jump the gap between me and a semi and I'm just like lol no onward Hedwig and I mash the gas💃
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-25 05:31:56	@delanceyhouston if only it were twitter appropriate 😂😘

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-26 15:23:57	I had a dream that I was packing up my room last night. Nothing crazy happened. I just packed boxes.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-26 15:55:05	@ColemanSumrall that's because you were traumatized yesterday😂
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-26 17:36:08	I know I slept like a rock because my eyeliner from last night was in pristine condition when I woke up this morning.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-27 14:38:04	I miss my friends already and it's only been 6 hours😢 @delanceyhouston take a lap around the lazy river for me😘

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-28 02:37:58	I just referred to the apartment I'm about to move into as "my house" to my dad and the conversation just kept going... It's so real rn😳
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-27 16:03:07	My dad driving my car right now has my anxiety at an all new high holy crap.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-27 16:28:20	Dad is talking to me about horses while Christina is on the radio. No.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-27 22:58:35	My dad and I just came to the immediate conclusion that we're getting Universal annual passes tomorrow😂😍

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-28 16:43:03	Only the bravest of souls go to theme parks in the summer. Not to mention a whole lot of dumbasses as well.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-29 15:29:42	My dad is such a friendly guy I feel like sometimes it can be misconstrued as the creepy old man kind of thing.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-29 16:13:29	Celebrating my amazing interview with Walt Disney World the only way I know how❤️⚡️ http://t.co/eyXI86HW4L

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-28 21:35:36	Letting my dad tour my apartment complex after my interview with Walt Disney World meant superfluous… http://t.co/H1c3D7hhLu

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-30 01:31:38	Dad sings the words to every song a solid beat and a half late and I kind of would rather ride home in silence. Is that bad?
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-07-30 03:02:52	I appreciate my dad coming on this trip but the initial reason was so I didn't have to drive. He's been sleeping since lake city.

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-08-08 01:50:24	I've come to the conclusion that this apartment was built for excessively tall humans and I need to invest in step stools.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-08-08 02:09:22	I love being able to see Wishes from my apartment, but going to bed before or at 10 pm is going to be damn near impossible😂🙈
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-08-08 04:33:45	I'm just confused, like Delancey doesn't live 2 streets over anymore and I can't drive down the street and end up at Danielle's. Where am I?

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-08-10 18:38:06	Like idc that the actors don't really get paid to be in RHPS. I would rather be happy and make nothing than be miserable making money.

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-18 23:29:54	@babe_cheeks HOLY FUCKING PREACH.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-18 21:25:50	They always find something new to do to my car when I bring it in for a simple oil change. It's remarkable.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-17 20:36:55	@terawaldron i went bare foot💁
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-17 20:37:48	@terawaldron I have an old pair from my Disney store days Tera.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-20 02:06:18	I found you, Miss Moogoo.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-20 03:25:52	Remember when Chuck Norris jokes were relevant. Lawlz http://t.co/CV5YU4OScK http://t.co/Po6PkkwaUz
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-19 16:30:35	I have so many Hispanic friends now, how did that happen.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-19 17:00:36	Hashtag Squad Goals 😈💕 @ The Salty Spittoon http://t.co/4PD3oTKl3y
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-20 22:40:17	I think today might be the day that Disney makes me cry.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-20 22:41:55	If I get sent back out to Turkey Cart, I will absolutely start crying.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-20 23:07:11	@KileeMcHenry omg thank you😭💕 I'll just keep telling myself he's just jealous his wife was a cow😂
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-21 05:04:53	@terawaldron someone should clean it up... That's a health hazard.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-22 19:03:08	Almost all of my favorite bands from middle and high school were really into the guy-liner trend...
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-22 01:57:36	I just spent the past 3 hours standing in the pouring rain. If I get pneumonia Disney will pay my doctor bills.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-22 02:19:47	I got left over MVM cookies &amp; Princess Tiana was like "ooh girl, gimme one of those cookies" but the elevator door slammed in between us😕
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-20 22:34:23	Looks like I'm going to have my first real guest services complaint. He took my name and location. Yippee.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-22 03:28:25	I JUST NEED TO BE IN ENTERTAINMENT SO DAMN BAD WHY DO YOU HATE MY FACE DISNEY?!?!?
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-22 20:40:14	I feel like if Tera's future husband doesn't dedicate The Rock Show by Blink 182 to her then he's not the right one.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-22 14:56:45	Never forget the confidence we has in 2009, Vikes. It takes real winners to print a "win" on a shirt before the game http://t.co/61S5I7v8LW

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-21 15:12:18	Please dear lord sweet baby Jesus let today be a good one.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-23 18:08:09	@terawaldron WHAT DID YOU DO

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-24 01:35:57	Every time I listen to This Joint by Slightly Stoopid. http://t.co/pJAB6Twq8f
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-24 01:37:56	“@LifeAsBros: Sounds about right. http://t.co/dZUTbOF5oF” I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A MARTY MCFLY LIFE PRESERVER JOKE SO DISAPPOINTED
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-25 17:18:14	I hope by the time I have kids were so far past gender roles that my son can ask for an easy bake oven for Xmas and no one would think twice
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-26 02:24:30	“@PoonanjiMarsha: so im still myself on my personal @B00TYPOPPER youll just have to look at a teenage boy instead of a greasy forehead” wut
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-26 02:26:34	@kristamayy @MadelynnRobicha poonanji came out as a fake and now I feel like my entire life was a lie. The entire skit we did, all lies.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-26 04:02:18	I'm honestly disappointed that I didn't watch any claymation Christmas movies or the Grinch this year. Like, wtf was I doing?

258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-24 19:44:44	I'm on a selfie stampede this week. I apologize.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-24 19:45:59	But do you understand how disappointing it is to have lived in a house for 15 years and find a prime selfie spot AFTER you've moved out?!?!
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-26 20:23:43	I just realized that it's been almost two months since I was suppose to get my one year pin from Disney....
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-26 23:52:18	New Years just went from nothing to EVERYTHING in 5 seconds omfg.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-26 23:58:14	If my Hispanic friends judge me for screaming "I'm in Miami, bitch!" when we pull up on NYE then we're going to have problems all night.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-26 23:58:50	FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKKKKKK now I need an outfit. I'm so unprepared.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-27 03:17:25	@JosueFM NEW YEARS IN MIAMI
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-28 15:00:40	Literally over night Disney can change everything they do and then expect their cast members to just figure it out on their own.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-28 19:10:08	Quick service really makes me miss Disney Store which is something I never would have thought I'd say.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-25 00:25:38	I NEED TO GET BACK TO ORLANDO SO TERA AND I CAN WATCH THE INTERVIEW.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-25 04:02:00	My grandpa said he hopes I don't wear my dark red lipstick out in public. Okay thanks gramps.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-25 04:06:58	@terawaldron he's old fashioned for sure.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-29 04:33:03	THIS IS PROOF THAT SOME PEOPLE ARENT CUT OUT TO BE PARENTS. LET YOUR DAUGHTER BE ATTACHED THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH HER.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-29 04:26:37	I'm so insulted by my cousins baby mamas post assuming that because her daughter is extremely attached it will make her less independent.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-29 11:31:46	@delanceyhouston @AmericasBelleXO help me I'm poor😞
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-29 15:53:39	Talked with the absolutely stunning, Queen Elsa, this morning about Olaf and getting him a new nose❄️💙 http://t.co/4qmmaxQxWN
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-30 02:31:24	I hope I didn't fuck Tera's hair up omg I'm really nervous right now.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-29 23:41:54	3 auditions in January all looking for Alice. You could say I'm a little psyched.
258224151	xoxosnr	2014-12-29 04:30:11	I had ridiculous separation anxiety when I was little and it never hindered me from being my own, independent person as a child
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-01 17:12:09	I woke up thinking "did last night actually happen" and yes, yes it did.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-01 17:12:38	My New Years resolution is to never leave my apartment again.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-01 17:55:06	This was the best part of last night tbh. http://t.co/HOceXs0C4h
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-02 02:37:37	WHY AM I WATCHING YOUTUBE INTERVIEWS FROM ALL THE MOVIES THAT HAVE MADE ME CRY IN THE LAST YEAR?!?
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-02 16:09:23	The other day one of my co workers said Harry was lame&amp;he only knew like one spell&amp;I just started rattling off spells&amp;everyone was like😳😧
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-02 16:34:29	So turns out my shift wasn't a 4 today. It was at 10. And now I'm a no call no show. RAD.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-01 01:25:45	I just broke a sweat opening the bottle of wine.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-01 19:00:09	In the theater world a shitty dress rehearsal makes for an amazing show. So NYE was my shitty dress rehearsal for an amazing 2015, right?
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-01 02:00:39	I wrote a really long and personal message for this collage but honestly, it's no ones business but my… http://t.co/KyBnpwxdd3
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-02 06:52:03	@delanceyhouston stfu that means I'll be 21 😳😳😳
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-02 06:53:04	@delanceyhouston WE HAVE TO STOP THIS MADNESS
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-02 07:10:25	I swear there are people with bigger tablets or iPads than my bedroom tv.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-01 04:57:37	Idk what's happening but this uber is about to cost a fucking fortune
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-01 05:00:49	I spent New Years in an uber.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-01 22:56:45	I want to make a quick trip to publix but I genuinely feel like it's too late in the day to still look like shit.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-01 23:17:42	The reminisce of everything I've eaten this week is on my coffee table and it's made me realize that I live like a dirty man.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-03 04:20:58	There is a special place in my heart for almost all stage-to-screen adaptations. Like they're great. Not perfect. But they're fun to watch.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-03 04:24:25	I want to be friends with these two. They're invited to the Salty Spittoon anytime. http://t.co/4d79JRvc1o
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-03 04:55:14	So interested in the convo going on over @KileeMcHenry tweet rn. I want to see how much farther this boy can shove his head up his own ass.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-01 05:04:19	But like out uber driver added us on Facebook.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-02 00:50:26	@Offftoneverland IM SCREAMING WTF

258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-02 01:35:55	@erinrosewelsh EXACTLY LIKE WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT. I STILL GET CHOKED UP THINKING ABOUT IT.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-03 05:07:50	Halloweentown is on ABC family. You're all welcome.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-05 16:13:50	Remember that one time I spent 155 dollars to do basically nothing for New Years. Good times, good times.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-05 19:39:35	Joined the crew in San Fransokyo today, we're the Big Hero 7 now😎 http://t.co/QQaqkhXcVJ
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-05 20:31:16	I made Peter Pan literally laugh out loud during the parade.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-04 22:13:44	@KileeMcHenry I was honestly wondering why I was having such a pleasant day. It was definitely the reason😂😂
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-04 22:27:05	@terawaldron wtf?! Are you home....
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-06 02:09:45	Sometimes I hate only having cast members for friends. http://t.co/qJ7ZuA7Udb

258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-04 19:37:49	Guess who just realized they went to work without a bra on today. 

THIS GIRL HAHAHAHA OMG YAS
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-06 07:00:50	Early I told my friends I wanted to start getting into writing and they all looked at me with disgust. K thx guyzz

258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-04 21:57:33	I still can't believe it took me four hours to realize I wasn't wearing a bra....
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-06 22:40:15	My student ID picture actually isn't horrible this time. I'm genuinely impressed.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-08 13:54:07	I should be in bed right now. I feel like shit.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-08 04:06:03	I just got really excited for the January 22nd audition because they're also looking for Gaston... Hello boys.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-09 04:02:28	I just really miss Donut Hole donuts.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-09 17:48:37	I just got really light headed walking through the tunnels. Let hope I don't pass out and die today.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-10 17:32:21	I hate 6 hour shifts because I hate 15 minute breaks. That's not enough time to do anything.

258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-12 15:39:55	Five guys opens at 11 and my second class doesn't start until 11:30. I'm so fucking golden this is a good day.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-12 19:29:00	@terawaldron @ColemanSumrall I approve of this conversation.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-12 19:32:52	My bio prof is from Pensacola. So I awkwardly stood in a line of students with legitimate questions just to tell her I was from Destin. Oops
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-12 20:21:23	I swear to god I'll never have an easy time when dealing with financial aid. Something is always fucked up.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-12 01:55:09	But wait, I really have to go to class tomorrow?
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-12 03:00:29	@ColemanSumrall in our natural habitat.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-13 03:59:04	I think my neighbors are testing out a new surround sound or they invited over an African tribal band.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-12 14:57:35	I have an hour between classes right now and I'm so tempted to just go sit in my car but I'm trying not to be a recluse this semester
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-13 13:12:30	McDonald's could function better by employing primates rather than the simpletons they have hired.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-13 04:25:30	If I think they're cute they are either gay or have a girlfriend frfr
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-12 16:15:18	@ashlyn_mariah I'm glad someone can relate 😂😂 I base my general happiness off of what I'm going to be eating that day.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-13 15:03:15	This girl in my gov class actually uttered the phrase "conservative and not conservative" LIBERAL HONEY YOU CAN SAY IT
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-13 15:34:32	Manager of the book store looked at my financial aid award and goes "oh you have a lot of money". Thanks, I know I'm really poor.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-13 16:12:11	Fuck this place.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-13 16:13:10	I wonder if they'll ever be a year I don't burst into tear at the school over financial aid.
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-13 16:26:34	Im having this existential crisis where Im generally perceived as an upper middle class member of society but actually from the working poor
258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-13 16:28:09	My speech prof oddly resembles Susan Sarandon and I have this strange desire to call her a slut.

258224151	xoxosnr	2015-01-14 04:21:14	I wish the question was "interests" not "hobbies". Alice in Wonderland and Harry Potter are technically "hobbies"
