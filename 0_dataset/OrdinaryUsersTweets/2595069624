2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-11-08 01:24:41	I saw your face and I don't wanna stare, cuz if I do I won't look away. Slow dancin' in a burning room n I'm gettin too old to play it safe.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-11-13 02:22:46	They said I'd never be anything, but...I think I still turned out awesome.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-11-18 02:59:17	@Slagelbagels Accurate.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-11-18 03:00:53	Running is the best way to remind yourself how much you love sitting.

2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-01 07:01:59	@AlexReneeSantos I feel like that's a terrible combination
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-01 07:02:35	@AlexReneeSantos Well jeez, that was uncalled for

2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-02 02:35:03	I hate religion. That's why I'm a Christian.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-03 18:43:44	@ClarisssaRivas you're right. But unfortunately, there's stupid people in the world messing things up for everyone else. They don't matter.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-03 18:35:28	@ClarisssaRivas she was probably just a psychopath
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-03 18:39:05	@ClarisssaRivas the opinions of ppl who want to tear down others are irrelevant, empty and meaningless. All u can do is feel bad for them.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-03 18:42:18	@ClarisssaRivas but she doesnt KNOW. Itd b like me complaining about period cramps. Dumb right? I have no experience with it. Same with her.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-04 04:43:49	@Iceman__34 HOLY CRAP THIS IS SO FUNNY

2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-06 22:07:06	@lecrae Hey! Would you mind telling me how many copies of "Real Talk" sold in its first week?
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-05 22:21:09	@velazco_felipe this tweet is literally one big contradiction. Haha
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-05 22:26:52	@espi_olvera that's actually kind of sweet... Hahaha

2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-07 18:22:49	@ClarisssaRivas oh well I couldn't tell. I mean, you never texted me back last night, Sooo.....
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-07 18:23:14	@glamoroushaley there's nothing like a mother's love.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-06 18:16:32	@averyveitel uhhhh we still beat ASU bro üòú
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-06 18:21:00	@averyveitel haha, Avery UofA is 10-3. One of the wins being a win against Oregon AT OREGON
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-06 18:22:52	@averyveitel haha, I'm sorry. I know it's hard being an ASU fan and having to deal with all of the disappointment.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-06 18:28:21	@averyveitel haha, how can you say that with a straight face when 1. We already beat you and 2. We're ranked higher than you?
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-06 18:33:56	@averyveitel If we hadn't won a game all season and THEN beat ASU or Oregon, I might agree. But 10-3 isn't lucky.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-06 18:36:22	@averyveitel you bashed UofA (the team that beat you) while hyping ASU. Hahah, I think YOURE the one with the problem of overhyping. Hahaha
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-06 18:37:30	@averyveitel and just a reminder, you lost 62-27 against UCLA.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-06 18:40:09	@averyveitel It's fun arguing with you üòú but it's kind of pointless when people know UofA is better.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-06 18:42:49	@averyveitel haha, but also, I love how I don't go to UofA and you don't go to ASU.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-06 18:44:59	@averyveitel it's about loyalty. Hahaha
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-06 18:56:53	@espi_olvera @averyveitel oh dang, now it's 2 on 1. You have no chance, Avery. Haha
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-09 02:41:33	She had the eyes of an angel, even think I might've seen wings.

2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-12 19:59:39	@Silystring that's the spirit
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-13 19:19:15	More heart, less attack.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-16 05:58:55	@AlexReneeSantos Mmm, weird.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-16 02:25:28	@AlexReneeSantos you're so cool
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-16 05:58:16	@AlexReneeSantos I don't know. Do you judge relevance by relative level of attractiveness?
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-22 04:58:58	@Bambamness haha, and both are still detrimental to you and hurtful to the one you cheat on.
2595069624	_Herrera116	2014-12-23 21:20:21	Trophies don't go to the ones who have a good beginning. Don't give up.
