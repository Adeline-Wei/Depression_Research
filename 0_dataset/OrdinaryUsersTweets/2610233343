2610233343	trrhyans	2014-09-02 01:31:40	It's either you scratch it and bleed worse, or you are tortured by the urge to itch a flesh wound, the struggle
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-09-02 03:18:22	@TroyTruman15 lol, did you google it?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-09-02 03:19:35	@TroyTruman15 when I doubt go straight to google

2610233343	trrhyans	2014-11-18 04:39:20	@TroyTruman15 shout out to Troy for jamming my notifications to the point they're 20 mins delayed
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-11-18 04:43:10	@mykateisname why don't you jump off a cliff into a steaming hot pile of your opinion sucks
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-11-18 04:45:24	@mykateisname wow that was original 👏👏👏
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-11-18 04:49:36	@mykateisname I'm sure you did, I guess not everyone can be as good at smack talking as me or @TroyTruman15 #ProStatus
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-11-18 04:54:23	@TroyTruman15 I think you've put out more tweets in the last 2 hours than I have in my entire life
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-11-18 04:58:56	@mykateisname maybe you should 😴💤 permanently
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-11-18 04:59:28	@mykateisname jk, I don't mean it 😜

2610233343	trrhyans	2014-11-19 02:49:43	@trevdep I don't understand why people don't follow others back. Like is your followers to following ratio really that important?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-11-19 02:50:21	@mykateisname yes, yes I was 😜
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-11-19 02:51:32	@JayniePlantz haha, not aiming at you specifically just people in general, that's why you weren't tagged. No hard feelings 😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-11-19 02:55:21	@trevdep @TroyTruman15 you should change your names to dumb and dumber so you can be a hilarious duo, just like you already are
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-11-19 02:56:55	@trevdep @TroyTruman15 constantly filling up my timeline with dumb stuff that is 90% of the time hilarious

2610233343	trrhyans	2014-11-25 02:06:23	@lauren_diebert the fact that your on twitter and you followed me disgusts me. This is my safe haven
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-11-25 02:08:22	@lauren_diebert twitter helps me generate lolz.... I feed off of the lolz

2610233343	trrhyans	2014-11-26 00:47:06	@rosiemurphy34 wow... If you were a pizza you would have no toppings, bc the joke was just plain cheesy

2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-04 03:33:05	Off the topic of the game. Who is upset the walking dead isn't gonna be on this Sunday?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-04 03:35:13	@trrhyans one favorite no retweets... Just another successful post on the twitter
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-04 03:36:00	“@hunterE15: There is no other sport for me but soccer⚽️” same, freshman nation for life
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-04 03:42:51	When I get more than one favorite on a tweet http://t.co/ikv2cZ2aWb
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-04 04:02:55	@sims215 I'm sure you don't wanna talk to me and I don't wanna talk to you. So I think I just found the answer to your prayers
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-05 00:14:20	I found your family!! @jessiffland http://t.co/48CQMSBOzG
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-05 01:51:28	@emilie_lynn_ lol, the fact that tweet was about my reaction from getting more than one favorite on a tweet and it only got one favorite.
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-05 03:42:22	@marissapezzino @trevdep lol. I've always been confused by the fact you always use these creepy frog drawings
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-05 03:43:10	@trevdep ok that one is pretty cool
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-05 03:48:37	@trevdep *vomits blood*
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-05 20:43:21	@TroyTruman15 obla=ma caused r/11
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 01:47:16	Just went Christmas caroling at the retirement home. And it was really nice they all seemed to enjoy it 😊
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 01:49:06	There was one old lady that seemed rather annoyed however. At the end she was all like "dang it, My ice cream melted" it was depressing 😕
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 01:58:39	@trevdep @aubriekunkelman you aimed way to high, lol
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 02:02:56	That moment when you go to turn on the walking dead and realize its not on this Sunday http://t.co/4wQDcy1g4e
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 02:05:11	That moment when you favorite someone's tweet way to fast do now they know how you have no life
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-06 00:00:24	After listening to offspring and playin video games for such a long time, I feel like I really need to hang out with someone
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 02:45:07	@BaysCrystal no that's completely normal for a 6 year old girl to want to do. Jk, don't we all?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-07 05:04:52	Went to a dance at a all girl catholic school and it was pretty fun. There was no grinding and actual quality music
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-07 05:05:35	I had to learn how to actually dance again. It was great #previoustweet
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-07 05:12:17	That moment when you're at a public school dance and nobody is grinding they're just dancing their heart out. Oh wait... That doesn't happen
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-07 05:16:20	That moment when you realize you just tweeted a full circle http://t.co/j7xzy694xB
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 04:21:47	Why does stress exist? It's dumb and I hate it.
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 04:23:13	That moment when you pour your heart out and tell someone everything your thinking over text. And realize they fell asleep...
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 04:26:57	I don't want a girlfriend right now. You're allowed to be a girl and my friend at the same time without being my girlfriend, ok
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 04:28:43	My life is just too busy right now, trying to start a relationship when busy is how you ruin something good before it has a chance to start
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 04:31:45	@NebbyMan if you're ok with no kissing or anything (bc not about the gay life) and lots of playing video game. We could make it work
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 04:33:05	@TroyTruman15 and that's why we are friends. Lol
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 04:50:14	I finished my gallon bag full of spicy peppers and now I don't know what to do with myself...
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 04:52:38	Someone needs to drive me to the store so I can buy more peppers... I needs more spicy food
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 04:57:33	There are three things that I live for in this world. 
1. To make people laugh
2. To eat spicy stuff
3. To eat beef jerky
In that order
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 05:11:31	-Im sick
me:eat some ramen
-Im sad
me:eat some ramen
-I broke my leg
me:eat some ramen
-I have cancer...
Me:it'll be better if you eat ramen
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-06 03:40:28	@BihnKyle I'm scarred of life 😟
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-06 03:48:29	That moment when you're eating peppers and you accidentaly inhale while you're chewing and then it feels like a volcano blew up in your nose
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-06 03:49:06	No? Is it just me? 
Ok...
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-06 03:51:06	I can't be the only person that eats spicy peppers as a casual snack
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-06 03:54:20	@gobrownies23 lol, close enough for me fish 😂
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-07 17:55:39	@NebbyMan I absolutely love your profile picture. It's the best ever
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-07 18:00:05	@NebbyMan your is 10/10 geniusness. Mine is just pixel art, lol
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-07 18:18:16	@NebbyMan haha, I could tell you were a lot younger
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 20:10:25	Not sure what is a better feeling. Helping out a friend or being helped out by a friend... Both are great feelings
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 20:16:46	@trevdep it's just as hard for a girl to say what she wants as it is for you to say what you want, no matter your gender it takes guys
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 20:17:58	@trevdep guts* lol
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 20:19:11	I hate typos with a passion. Like, you can jump off a cliff ok
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 20:26:17	You can tell I woke up late and don't feel good when my hair is down
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 20:27:56	That or I'm dressed up as black Peter Parker. #OriginalTrilogyForTheWin
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 20:32:01	Toby Maguire is the best ok. Andrew Garfield is just a bumbling hipster
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 20:54:49	What's the difference between Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker and Porky the Pig? Andrew Garfield is a hipster. Besides that they're the same
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 21:44:04	@smmullins10 you're welcome 😏😎
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 21:47:09	No SOAR tomorrow #ThankTheDramaClub
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 22:42:10	@mykateisname Not an attention-seeker. Not a hipster. #JustKate

2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 23:25:36	@tinyk99 @TroyTruman15 @hayley_kandik lol, yes it is
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 23:57:25	@mykateisname or do you want like a philosophical statement?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 23:58:39	@mykateisname I'm tempted to give you a really good one I came up with myself. I was gonna save it for later but you can have it if you want
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-08 23:59:07	@mykateisname you might not even like it
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-09 00:03:32	Life's not fair, If life gives you lemons... eat those lemon how they come. Bc life didn't give you water and sugar to make lemonade
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-09 00:04:44	@mykateisname it didn't fit with your name in there, lol
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-09 00:05:39	@mykateisname yeah it's a sassy one. I came up with it when telling someone to stop complaining, lol
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-09 00:07:22	@mykateisname that'll be $5
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-09 00:08:01	@mykateisname lol, jk. But I will need your soul
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-09 00:10:47	@mykateisname contemplating statment... *dies*

2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-09 02:51:28	“@BaysCrystal: We'll I lost my pants tonight 😅” same
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-09 02:58:57	@mykateisname is this a message addressed to yourself?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-09 03:04:24	@mykateisname @TroyTruman15 just bc I rock skinny jeans better than you doesn't mean you can call me a girl
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-09 20:32:00	“@mykateisname: uncomfy”
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-09 21:58:04	And you said it was random and didn't really match. My random idea just became reality, lol @msfoxycomets http://t.co/S6EpIURL4Y
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-09 22:07:14	I'm a psychic
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-09 22:28:30	The new #YouTubeRewind is out!!

2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-10 21:29:09	*eats 3 pounds of chips and salsa*
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-10 21:50:28	@OMGreggila lol, kinda wish I could retweet that. I mean that was hilarious, I never saw it coming haha
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-10 21:52:04	Not even 2 minutes after I finish my chips my body decided it wanted to eat half a pumpkin pie
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-10 21:53:52	"But tanner, where did you get a pumpkin pie?"

Well now that you mention it.... I think it was leftover from thanksgiving 😶
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-10 21:55:23	Not even 30 seconds after eating half a pumpkin pie and my body decides that i must eat half a loaf of bread...
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-10 21:56:33	I just ate alot of really random foods... And I feel like a better person having done it
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-10 22:03:13	Tummy- don't you feel better now Tanner
Me- yes Mr. Tummy, yes I do
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-10 22:46:23	@OMGreggila haha, yeah I guess I did. Lol
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-10 04:08:46	@TroyTruman15 as opposed to what?....
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-10 04:10:32	@TroyTruman15 wow, I'm dumb. I shoulda known that
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-10 04:21:14	@trrhyans of course no one knows, what was I thinking...
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-11 03:06:15	That really depressing moment when you take a girl out in a date and realize you forgot you wallet and had to make her pay...
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-11 03:09:17	And that's why I'm single, lol #previoustweet
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-11 03:13:04	That awesome moment when somebody compliments your shoelaces. Ohh wait.. That only happens to me
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-11 03:19:44	It's annoying when your texting someone and theyre like
"so how was your day?"
Girl, what do you think? I went to school, it was terrible!
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-11 03:24:25	@NebbyMan I'm likening to new profile pic. It's almost as good as your old one. But the fact it's like 2 years more recent make up for it
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-11 03:25:05	@NebbyMan what on earth kind of a word is likening?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-11 23:08:04	Do you think I could pull off a pair of parachute pants?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-11 23:39:24	If cheese was green would so many people still love it?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-12 02:24:36	I swear, I'm always hungry....
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-11 04:29:39	Define likening
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-11 04:33:14	I guess @urbandictionary can't define likening...
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-11 04:41:00	Ok, so maybe I tweeted about food alot lately.... Is this a fat joke? http://t.co/EiRl0rOYnx
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-13 03:22:24	So I just played a soccer game wearing a dress shirt. Probably the first person ever to do that, bc why not. Plus dress shirts are cool
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-13 04:01:25	“@TroyTruman15: Tanner is life”
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-13 04:15:39	“@IGN: If @Marvel gets #SpiderMan back, it will be without Garfield. http://t.co/HeF6nebBH9 http://t.co/86RNn1XR7N” yesssssssssssss
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-13 04:39:36	Sophomores watched Pearl Harbor all week and that's all they've been talking about. And I just want them to shut up, b/c Michael Bay sucks
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-13 04:41:07	I'm sorry Michael Bay fans. But he's just a terrible director ok. His movies are entertaining sure, but if you really pay attention the suck
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-13 04:44:49	Now Christopher Nolan... That man is amazing. He was sent down from the heavens to come and direct movies
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-13 04:49:21	Chortle
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-12 23:33:42	If your ever feeling down or grumpy. Just search blobfish on google images, I guarantee you'll feel better
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-13 22:05:18	@mykateisname watch out guy! Kate is the next Nostradamus. So this must be true
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-13 02:36:21	@TroyTruman15 @Nathan_Reineck Troy.... That  joke wasn't very nice. You could even go so far as to say it was a low blow
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-13 02:55:36	If anyone is willing to take me to see interstellar before they take it out if theaters I will pay for my ticket, your ticket, and gas
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-13 03:28:04	@NebbyMan tennis is completely different and that is much more normal. But I'll still give you props for lookin nice on the court

Either.
1. I can relate/ I like the thought
Or.
2. It made me laugh (which is like 90%)
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 02:12:28	Watching 'The Crow' again bc that is an amazing movie
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 02:13:51	If I mention a movie on twitter than that means you should probably watch it
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 02:16:29	For Greater Glory
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 02:21:28	Scott Pilgrim vs. The World

2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 02:29:02	@msfoxycomets that's so funny you had me like http://t.co/FjEAkHJ2cK
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 02:29:35	@TroyTruman15 you need to make that a priority. Plus every other movie I just mentioned
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 02:31:17	@jessiffland I'm jelly
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 02:42:22	The Book of Eli
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 03:24:46	I lack the motivation to do anything right now
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 03:49:39	@trevdep how about you don't
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 03:51:01	@trevdep i know a guy that can do that for you if that's what your into. But I'm not about that life
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 03:53:04	@TroyTruman15 I can be your someone
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 04:10:32	@OMGreggila you are literally the only person to use that hash tag ever... Like seriously... Ever
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 04:12:56	@OMGreggila in the bright side it's the top tweet for that hash tag http://t.co/txvVsWVAEc
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 04:38:10	I feel like this is gonna be one of those nights where Im not gonna fall asleep til like 4 or 5. Then when i wake up ill laugh at my bedhead
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-16 03:45:17	I really like your face...
Just sayin
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-16 03:59:19	@marissapezzino @eiriannvanessaa and ill be glad to laugh at both of you
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-16 04:03:18	@eiriannvanessaa @TroyTruman15 @marissapezzino dude, I know Troy. And noone is gonna be killing me. I'm immortal
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-16 04:05:30	@eiriannvanessaa @TroyTruman15 @marissapezzino unless you like removed all beef jerky from the world.... That would probably kill me
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-16 04:17:49	I accidentally sat on my butt.. I think i broke it b/c there's a crack right down the center and It doesn't function as a TV remote anymore
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-16 04:18:46	Ohh so your saying your butt doesn't double as a tv remote then?... Well I bet your jealous
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-16 04:30:06	Ohh, I almost forgot to post this...

2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 05:10:24	@trevdep @TroyTruman15 too far man. I know our school motto this year is "cross the line" but that's not a line you should be crossin
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 05:11:42	@trevdep @TroyTruman15 jk, if you wanna go for troys booty I won't stop you
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 05:13:32	@trevdep *reports to the police*
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-16 14:19:11	“@TweetLikeAGirI: When you want the new Nike Glow Pair, but you ballin on a budget http://t.co/FY5oLfi771” they copied you @marissapezzino
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-14 16:42:46	First time back on snap chat in like a month. A d I accidentally blocked like 3 people..... I knew there was a reason I didn't like snapchat
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 02:42:26	Hey, I couldn't help but to notice that you spilt a little bit of gorgeousness all over yourself
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 02:44:15	@ShelbieMorghan it supposed to be funny, terrible pickup lines are hilarious
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 02:48:02	@ShelbieMorghan were you genetically bred to be that beautiful, or are you just a miracle
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 02:52:53	@ShelbieMorghan your eyes look like they were forged from the soul of the last unicorn to walk the earth
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 02:56:44	@ShelbieMorghan your nose is as cute as a little puppy fetching a ball for its first time
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 02:58:57	You could stop the terror of Isis if only they could see the grace of your smile 🙌
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 03:04:33	@ShelbieMorghan it should be illegal for dogs to come near you. B/c to make someone as perfect as you feel sick should be a crime.
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 03:08:44	Are you an angel that fell from heaven? Because it looks like you landed face first on a brick...
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 03:18:38	Everyone told me you were out of my league, but it's not my fault you make everyone look like a potato in comparison to you
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 03:39:04	@Skylar_J strikes and you're out
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 03:43:08	Whenever your feeling down just search blobfish on google images. That goes to every person who is sadly mopping around on twitter
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 03:54:30	Shout out to all the girls who need a cheesy pickup line in their life.
I like your face... Just saying
Sincerely
-Tanner Rhyans
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 03:55:41	Shoutout to all the people who find #PickupLineTuesday annoying.... 
I don't blame you
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 04:02:28	@smmullins10 10/10 son right here 🙌
That touched me right in me heart 👉❤
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-18 05:13:47	Life is honestly just way too hard sometimes.... I need someone to talk to... but my go to people I usually talk to are all asleep 😔
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-18 05:25:06	@TroyTruman15 ..... What in earth did I just watch
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-18 05:37:15	Telling someone you love them when you're afraid they might not feel the same way is hard
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-18 05:31:30	@TroyTruman15 It was painfully to watch, but at the same time it was really quite good
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-18 05:39:47	But telling someone who likes you that you don't feel the same way is even harder. Bc it's harder to hurt someone-else than it is yourself
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-18 05:42:27	Honestly. Telling someone I don't like them back is the #1 hardest thing for me. Literally the worst feeling ever
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-18 05:45:49	I'd rather french kiss an ostrich then have to tell a girl who really likes me I don't feel the same way.
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-18 05:50:53	Some girls crave ice cream when they're depressed or sad.... I could really go for some spicy peppers right about now
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 20:18:37	For everyone who start winter break tomorrow and already finished exams... I am thoroughly jealous
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-18 23:58:48	I just ate over a pound of salami and cheese sandwiches....
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-17 20:29:21	@mykateisname god is good
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-19 03:10:53	@TroyTruman15 is that a fried turkey leg?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-19 03:12:09	@TroyTruman15 well it looks like a fried chicken wing
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-20 02:41:54	@mykateisname that's pretty deep... But I'm not sure I can accept that as a true statement
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-20 16:12:30	Studying my script for Much Ado About Murder and there are random holes and missing stage directions and I am so confused....
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-20 20:10:51	@msfoxycomets I was referencing Leslie's line right under the highlighted part http://t.co/IbfNwEsNOU
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-21 03:05:24	@arian_hayes "me Arian"? Who do you think you are talking like that, Tarzan?
"Me Arian.. You.. Depew"
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-21 03:30:42	I've only been out of school for one day. And i feel so much better mentally and physically
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-21 04:03:38	I told my friend something dumb as a joke, then said to look it up on http://t.co/012Y31UhSW and she spent 5 mins trying to find the website
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-21 04:06:59	Her smart phone made it a link in my text. So she spent forever trying to figure out why the link didn't work, Lol #previoustweet
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-21 04:43:43	“@TroyTruman15: U are a hipster” @mykateisname
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-21 04:59:26	@mykateisname #ADayInTheLifeOf#JustKate
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-21 05:02:49	@TroyTruman15 pretty much
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-21 05:09:04	That awkward moment when you realize gravity hates you. #Ifell
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-21 05:21:03	@TroyTruman15 sometimes Shelbie or Rosie. Then that's it
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-22 13:57:12	Is it sad that I'm not really exited for Christmas at all?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-22 14:01:05	@mykateisname I figured that would be the general response. And good morning to you too
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-20 22:38:04	@OMGreggila only like 1 out of 25 people can pull it off
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-23 22:01:03	Just remembered today is Tuesday, and last week I started pickup line Tuesday. So get ready for some cheesy likes
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-23 22:02:40	Lines** #previoustweet
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-23 22:05:52	Wow, Christmas must have come early this year. Because the only thing I asked for was an attractive funny girl, and here you are
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-23 23:59:02	Your hand is starting to look a little heavy, do you need me to hold it for you?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-23 02:08:19	All I want for Christmas is for someone to take me to interstellar
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 03:18:28	Your eye is really beautiful. I'd compliment both but I don't wanna sound desperate
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 04:06:27	I know I've told you this before... But I really like your face
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 04:27:47	Not sure if people don't fav. my pickup lines b/c the actually don't like them, or if they're just afraid they'll be associated with them...
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 04:29:57	Probably the second one, noone wants people to think they've got a thing for me. I'm too weird, that could ruin they're image
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 04:32:08	@MarquardtTyler do you spend 2 hours in the morning to archive that look or do you wake up gorgeous?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 04:32:27	@MarquardtTyler achieve**
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 04:36:11	Imma just start complimenting random people who follow me. And see who is brave enough to respond
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 04:38:28	@mykateisname is your hair made from the threads of a unicorns mane? B/c it's truly beautiful
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 04:41:34	@marissapezzino you have really sexy ears.
-ps. I swear I'm not making a move on your girl @djwitt1996. I'm just complimenting random people
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 04:43:18	@djwitt1996 you should be a weather man. they'd have no problem paying you just to look good and predict weather incorrectly
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 04:52:45	@TroyTruman15 d'you buy your clothes at http://t.co/3koTiCxrUN? bc I heard that only really attractive people are allowed to use that site
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 04:54:25	@TroyTruman15 hey I'm coming up with these things on spot here. Just be happy you got a custom made pickup line
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 04:56:59	@TroyTruman15 the sound of your voice can make even the angriest Chinese man feel peace and be happy.
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 04:57:42	@mykateisname your face makes my heart sparkle
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 05:00:35	@mykateisname I miss your face
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 05:06:34	Well #PickupLineTuesday finally got some feedback and favorites. I can now go to bed with a smile on my face
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 05:11:03	Oh geez! It's Christmas Eve and I never even wrote my letter to Santa!! Quick!! Tell me how to spell your name!!
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 05:12:11	All I want for Christmas is you, me, and a mistletoe above our heads
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 05:24:08	Don't be a Grammar Nazi http://t.co/SS3XNKHpZp
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 05:26:45	@Markeverhardt Tuesday is technically over so Imma have to hit you up with a compliment next week
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-25 13:05:22	@tinyk99 I was confused at first too, then I was like, "Ohhhhhhh, it's Troyyyy." Bc his slightly oversized upper face
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-25 13:33:41	I want some salt
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-25 13:33:57	I think I have a problem
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-25 13:40:35	@Markeverhardt you untraditional piece of crap!!!
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-25 13:43:40	@Markeverhardt jk, I still 💜u
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-25 22:44:55	Yessss, this was literally the only thing I asked for for Christmas 😁😊 http://t.co/34Q23H1wZM
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 04:29:18	@OMGreggila I recently ran out of the Adidas but I got like 3 bottles for Christmas
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 04:30:20	@OMGreggila yeah way to much really... And I don't even like axe. It's too strong
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 04:32:10	If girls were blind and all they could do was smell, I'd be set for life
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 04:35:00	@OMGreggila haha, thanks. I love being on twitter because my favorite thing to do is make people laugh
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 04:43:22	@Chloe_Kouts haha, thanks 😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 04:48:48	I seriously want to nom on some hot peppers right now but I'm all out. If anyone wants to give me some peppers for Christmas that be great
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 04:49:44	Is it weird that I like peppers that much? Like to the point where I'll eat a ziplock bag full of them in one sitting?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 04:52:17	@alexisnicole334 *cough* pc *cough* is better *cough*
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 05:00:54	@mykateisname if you can't sleep, hit your head hard on a table until you pass out. It's just a suggestion, not a safe one, but it'll work
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 01:30:45	“@TroyTruman15: send pics of you in a Christmas sweater as a Christmas present plz”
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 01:39:15	@TroyTruman15 robbing banks is illegal
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 04:21:08	My family got me 3 axe bundle packets for Christmas... Do I smell that bad
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 04:21:34	I don't even like axe. Old spice is bae
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 04:23:58	@gobrownies23 not according to the daily compliments I get on my scent 😏
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 04:26:05	The ladies dig a nice old spice /Adidas combo 👃❤💙
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 15:14:08	@DerekSessoms its more like a team if somewhere from 10-20 preople. Hacking is inevitable, you can try to prevent it. But you cant stop it
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 15:26:44	@Bshan21 They have hundreds of ips threaded between theirs and the one they hacked with. Jumping all over the world so they can't be tracked
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 15:27:16	@Bshan2143 it was before. They fixed it though
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 15:28:47	@Bshan21 that was supposed to be a reply to one of your previous tweets. Not sure why it isn't....
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 15:48:32	@TroyTruman15 @Bshan2143 Do you really think such large respectable companies wouldn't have enough serverspace for a Christmas crowd?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 15:49:08	@TroyTruman15 @Bshan2143 you were clearly misinformed. They aren't stupid. They would think ahead an open extra servers
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 15:50:59	@TroyTruman15 @Bshan2143 it's just a matter of how much serverspace they would have had open. And I'm sure they had plenty they're not dumb
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 15:53:50	@Bshan2143 @TroyTruman15 they shut themselves off so they could protect themselves while they changed they're firewall to a new system
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 15:58:09	@Bshan2143 @TroyTruman15 it depends. Xbox clearly was able to do it faster. Sony is taking more time
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 15:58:46	@Bshan2143 @TroyTruman15 going faster pleases the consumers, but it could also backfire bc they weren't as carefull
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 16:01:52	@TroyTruman15 @Bshan2143 Sony had been hacked before so  sure they were more carefull, and that's why they're taking more time, to be safer
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 16:02:36	@Bshan2143 @TroyTruman15 bc even if you know they're hacking you, it's still hard to stop a team of experts
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 16:03:07	@Bshan2143 @TroyTruman15 they were down a long time that time. It was bad
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-27 05:12:05	@hayley_kandik yeah, I know. And I did know, just you you know I knew
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-27 05:13:22	@ShelbieMorghan @Madison_Grace9 cuddle your dog. Or your shoe if your really desperate
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-27 05:14:46	@ShelbieMorghan @Madison_Grace9 maybe she smells funny. Idk I haven't smelt her lately
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-27 05:18:54	@Madison_Grace9 @ShelbieMorghan lol, poor you and your doglessness... Im pretending that's a word
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-27 05:24:01	Don't you hate it when you try to type a word you just made up and autocorrect changes it 5 times before you finally get it the way you want
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-27 04:09:35	@eherrera514 a quesarito with beans instead of meat. It's great
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-27 04:13:22	Smashbros. For wii u is the greatest thing ever
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-27 05:08:10	@hayley_kandik lol, whyyyy?
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-27 05:09:08	@hayley_kandik that is rather random...
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-26 04:28:21	@gobrownies23 multiple people. It's not just one person. Noone likes me fish, they just like how I smell. But if the ladies were blind 😎😘
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-28 13:30:27	Haven't slept a minute in the past 24 hours. Imma sleep now
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 22:56:32	Father Tim after mass-"I hope you all have a good Christmas tomorrow and sleep in nice and late. Oh wait... You all have children, hahahaha"
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 23:01:46	Get it? b/c children always wake up their parents really early on Christmas morning
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 23:03:17	Christmas isn't about the presents... It's about the food
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-24 23:09:53	@lucasgreggila the excitement contained in a little child overpowers their patience and ability to wait. Therefor the children wake them up😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-25 00:29:09	I just ate 2 pounds of lasagna, not even exaggerating. I had six pieces of a 5 pound lasagna
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-25 02:15:37	@OMGreggila that's just what we do on Christmas Eve, haha 😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-25 02:18:30	My grandma just called my uncle a wimp for putting a coat on to go outside, lol
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-25 02:48:37	"You aren't true friends unless you buy each other VS🙆" -@ShelbieMorghan
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-31 00:53:08	I don't know if you've noticed the way everyone always looks at you... But its probably because they all want you as much as I do
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-31 00:48:27	Pickup line Tuesday guys and girls. If you got a line tweet it. If you don't care.... You're boring

2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-31 02:03:42	Did you hear that thud?.. It was the sound of me falling for you
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-31 02:33:03	If you favorite or retweet one of my pickup lines. Odds are ill give you your own
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-31 02:36:35	@arian_hayes have you looked in the mirror lately? Sorry that was a dumb question... You would have died of happiness
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-31 02:41:08	@OMGreggila your parents should win the Nobel Peace Prize for bringing your beautiful face into the world
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-31 02:43:03	@Skylar_J you wanna go for a ride in my car with me? I promise it's not the one that's been following you for the last few days...
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-31 02:57:32	@emilie_lynn_ one time, I fell asleep and I thought I had died.. Turns out I was just dreaming about your heavenly face
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-31 04:17:07	@mykateisname you should post a selfie. So I can retweet it and brighten up the day of everyone in my timeline
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-31 02:51:15	@lucasgreggila has any girl ever told you that you're so cute it makes her speechless?.. Yeah I didn't think so
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-31 05:21:10	@audreyxXxmarie do you need me to take off you jacket for you? Because you look really hot
2610233343	trrhyans	2014-12-31 05:03:19	@rosiemurphy34 I was gonna try to give you a compliment but there's so much I love about you I couldn't fit it in 140 characters...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-02 03:59:23	My face when I wake up in the morning and find out she texted first http://t.co/tFWRLIkZqZ
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-02 04:07:38	@gobrownies23 Kate won't do it bc she's too hipster
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-02 04:09:43	@JakeGruben me on #PickuplineTuesday
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-02 04:11:14	@gobrownies23 how long till you think she notices were talking about her and calling her hipster?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-02 04:13:17	@gobrownies23 she's prolly gonna yell at me when she finds out. She loves you too much to yell at you
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-02 04:15:07	@gobrownies23 yup you too cute she can't yell at you
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-02 04:25:35	We should strike against how overpriced indoor is!!
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-02 04:37:52	@gobrownies23 @mykateisname dude it took her half n hour
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-02 04:38:14	@gobrownies23 @mykateisname and she didn't even yell at me. Score
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-02 04:53:08	@gobrownies23 the fact that shes isn't answer that, haha
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-02 05:16:38	Guy- "Page 2 guys am I right! Am I right!"
Me- *shoots him in the face*
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-02 05:55:58	New drinking game. Every time @gobrownies23's uses a new # take a drink
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-02 06:28:48	Rt if you're still awake bc your sleeping schedule couldn't be more messed up
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-02 06:35:39	"Sleeping sounds nice, now if only I could remember how..."
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-03 03:07:00	The village got put in Netflix. If you haven't already seen it its an amazing movie and I suggest you watch it while its still here
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-01 05:43:05	Ok just so you know girls, leggings as pants is so last year. You won't be needing to do that anymore
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-01 23:40:41	If you had to be one age forever how old would you be. 21? 7? 18? 30?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-03 17:48:25	@Madison_Grace9 what are you even doing with your life right now?...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-03 17:54:25	I got hired at a coffee shop #NoGrease
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-03 18:19:17	@Madison_Grace9 haha, cute. Babysitting I take it?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-03 18:20:09	@Madison_Grace9 lol, have fun with that 😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-03 20:18:08	I just finished my 8th bowl of ramen this week....
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-03 21:59:07	Whenever someone calls me a ladies man or a player I'm all like "haha 😅"
"no. 😐"
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-06 01:29:33	Shh, quite... I think I can hear someone caring about what I say... Nope that was just a spider crawling on the floor...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-04 16:00:50	If I had a dollar for every time I opened snap chat without someone telling me to, asking me to, or bc there was a notification. I'd have $2
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-06 02:02:09	If only I had a dollar for every time I accidentally said quite instead of quiet....
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 00:40:11	Can indoor soccer just start now. I need this in my life...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 00:45:02	My days are too empty in the afternoon between seasons
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 01:39:33	@hayley_kandik and everything nice
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 01:39:50	@hayley_kandik and thus, the powderpuff girls were born
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 01:58:43	You're flawless
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 02:08:34	When you tell me I'm funny I'm all like http://t.co/dkW2TcNSVh
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 02:35:14	@OMGreggila I swear, have you seen me Ian pictures? No? Bc I delete them. Cameras don't like me I'm better in person
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 02:37:58	@OMGreggila haha, I have one picture of me wearing Trevor's glasses but that's just bc I looked like a hipster and I thought it was funny
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 02:38:54	@OMGreggila and I like sharing what I find funny
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 02:48:21	@OMGreggila then you should love mine. It's a sprite from a pokemon game. And I am intact not from a pokemon game 😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-04 23:01:45	@Madison_Grace9 there's a good chance I'm gonna fall asleep 3 times tomorrow
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 02:27:19	Every time I look at people's profile pictures I ask myself why I'm the only person out of my friends who isn't photogenic...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 02:33:19	@OMGreggila don't be hating, I love pixel art. Im not sayin' I'm ugly (last time I did I got yelled at), I'm just sayin' I'm not photogenic
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 02:41:02	@OMGreggila I posted it awhile ago. It's not too far back there
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 02:41:22	@OMGreggila just look at my pictures
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 02:44:39	@OMGreggila I was posing in the most hipster pose I could think of. There was multiple people instructing me how to selfie properly, lol
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 02:46:00	@OMGreggila lol, that's misleading. I don't wear glasses
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-05 02:54:03	@TripInATweet this is insanely accurate. Only change is I'm not all about money and I would never just end a friendship in one moment♏
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 02:23:22	Just remembered #PickuplineTuesday
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 02:27:07	Are you Netflix? Because I often feel the urge to ignore all other people and stare at you for hours on end
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 02:30:06	If you would go out with me, that'd make me even happier than a 2-hour delay
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 02:35:10	I was always told ugly started with U? But not in this case... No... Upretty
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 02:39:41	All you really need to pickup your soulmate is a seductive wink 😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 02:57:07	I lost a follower... We're the winks too much?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 03:00:43	@NebbyMan yesssss!!! Lol😂
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 03:04:16	@audreyxXxmarie @tinyk99 it wasn't till I read this tweety at now that I finally realized what ily means.... I am so behind the times...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 03:04:48	@audreyxXxmarie @tinyk99 tweet just now** oops
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 03:45:20	@Madison_Grace9 did it wink at you seductively? And if so, were you swiped of your feet with the desire to follow your heart?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 03:47:27	@Madison_Grace9 really hope you saw my tweet from earlier that I'm referencing, bc if not.... I'm sure that was just weird for you
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 03:52:18	@Madison_Grace9 a simple wink isn't enough for you?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 03:54:20	@Madison_Grace9 I was always told happiness started with an H, but I personally think my happiness would start with U
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 01:55:46	@hayley_kandik if I had a dollar for every time you just said serious, I would go from broke to having 3 dollars #Rich
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 02:14:11	🎶B-B-B-Bennie and the jetsssss, Ohh but they're weird and wonderful! Ohh Bennie she's really keen! She's got electic boots, a mohair suit!🎶
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 20:39:50	I was looking forward to my game today, wish it didn't get rescheduled
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 00:40:36	@Chloe_Kouts lady who took the picture had pale person lighting for my pic. And I looks so dark it's just weird
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 00:51:17	@Chloe_Kouts you can't guilt me... *he says while fighting the temptation to post his school picture*
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 00:56:18	@ShelbieMorghan @OMGreggila @Chloe_Kouts lol, you guys are hanging up on me. That's not nice
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 00:56:54	@ShelbieMorghan @OMGreggila @Chloe_Kouts ganging up on me**
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 01:00:59	@Chloe_Kouts @ShelbieMorghan @OMGreggila see now I'd feel bad letting you all down, but at the same time that's probably my best option, lol
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 01:06:40	@ShelbieMorghan @Chloe_Kouts @OMGreggila now it's just been built up waaaaay too much
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 01:14:06	@OMGreggila @ShelbieMorghan @Chloe_Kouts peer pressure wins ill DM it
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 01:29:19	@OMGreggila that makes an official 2 pics of me online now
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 01:31:53	@Madison_Grace9 @Chloe_Kouts @OMGreggila @ShelbieMorghan someone continue my #PickuplineTuesday's for me
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 01:36:18	@Madison_Grace9 @Chloe_Kouts @OMGreggila @ShelbieMorghan *presses delete button*
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 01:42:28	I make one comment and it turns into a conversation. Then ten minutes later and it's a conversation between 5 people lol 😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 01:48:12	“@Chloe_Kouts: I wish I was tan😞” @Chloe_Kouts I bet when you tweeted this you didn't expect to have like over 50 replies, lol
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 23:55:47	@alexisnicole334 bc that call earlier was to remind your parents of the meeting you dummy
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-07 23:59:45	@alexisnicole334 nothing lol, just forget about it😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 00:24:48	@Chloe_Kouts I wouldn't mind being paler.... Wanna trade?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 00:26:22	@Chloe_Kouts haha, I'm into pale skin soo.... I don't care much for my own
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 00:28:37	@Chloe_Kouts haha, if you can find some magical way to switch skin tones, ill do it. I'm not sure there's currently a way though, haha
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 00:30:07	@Chloe_Kouts lol😂 yeah it definitely would😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 00:31:57	@Chloe_Kouts it's a good look though, I promise
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 00:38:47	@Chloe_Kouts haha, I look black in my school picture sooo....
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 00:41:36	@Chloe_Kouts haha, it's all opinion😉😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 00:45:18	@Chloe_Kouts lol, that's great. But trust me you'd prefer that over my picture. It's terrible
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 00:47:07	@Chloe_Kouts haha, probs not though
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 00:55:39	@Chloe_Kouts I'd rather not though bc thatd be like the only picture of me on the Internet and also the ugliest picture of me ever taken lol
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 01:19:11	@OMGreggila @Chloe_Kouts @Madison_Grace9 @ShelbieMorghan in what world is that a good way, lol

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 15:43:48	@ShelbieMorghan @BestProAdvice I always put a ton of crushed red pepper in my ramen which is scientifically proven to counter heart disease😏
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-08 15:44:15	@trevdep nope
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-10 04:52:31	Pretty sure the gashes in my shin are little gateways to hell. Because I just took a shower and it felt like satan was trying to crawl out
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-09 04:36:37	@Madison_Grace9 @smilestreet2 *jumps off a bridge onto a freshly frozen river*

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-09 06:00:40	Can I just be a grandpa now? I'm already so behind the times. Like, I never know the trends or any if theses sayings and acronyms
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-09 13:51:59	I don't want to school.....
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-09 15:29:05	I wore a XL sweater that looks waaaay too big on me... But I don't care it's freakin cold right now

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-09 21:37:14	@Chloe_Kouts jk, sexism is cool😎😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-10 02:52:23	@OMGreggila I didn't, our games were at the exact same time though
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-10 02:55:31	I got cleated somethin fierce today. Good news is I didn't get any blood on my socks!!👍 Bad news is my shin guard is drenched in blood😕
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-10 04:26:25	I'd take a picture of my insane flesh wound to post online but my legs are soooo hairy, lol

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-12 02:21:36	Please quote tweet that for me
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-12 02:22:19	@OMGreggila no one can quote tweet your tweet though, lol

By now you should've somehow realized what you've got to do🎶
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-12 02:41:46	I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now🎶

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-12 02:45:03	I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding🎶
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-12 02:45:37	And all the lights that lead us there are blinding🎶

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-14 02:59:06	@marissapezzino @msfoxycomets I try to be funny and you two take me too seriously. I'm too good for either of you anyway 😏😘
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-14 03:22:13	When you get denied by both of your stage baes @marissapezzino @msfoxycomets http://t.co/35wlnOhWIe

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-15 21:44:04	If I give you glares or stare at you, don't take it personal, it's not meant to be mean or seductive. I do it to literally everyone
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-15 21:48:38	Bc that's just what I do!
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-15 21:49:15	If you don't like what I do, eat a lemon!!
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-16 20:50:50	Jeff: What day is it?
Me: A good day for you to get a calendar
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-17 03:58:50	If you don't like The Eagles your taste in music sucks.
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-17 04:00:16	If you haven't heard of The Eagles then you need to pull your head out of the mainstream and take a fresh breath of older, better music
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-17 04:08:33	“@Madison_Grace9 If you don't like cheese you're probably lactose intolerant” trueeee
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-17 04:48:21	@MarquardtTyler @arian_hayes makeup is so useless in my eyes. I'd say it's a waste of money but it's actually really good for the economy...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-17 04:52:25	@arian_hayes @MarquardtTyler maybe... 😏😘
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-17 04:52:54	@arian_hayes @MarquardtTyler jk, I'm taken 😜
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-18 16:07:53	Well I can officially say I beat destiny's entire story in one sitting
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-18 16:11:41	I am now going to crawl out of this basement and renter society
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-18 16:19:59	@TroyTruman15 play station.
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-18 16:21:25	@TroyTruman15 4 but I played it at Anthony's. I don't have the ps4 yet. I spent the night and while he slept I beat the entire game
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-18 16:23:23	@TroyTruman15 I got a legendary hand cannon in my first 5 mins. of playing
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-18 16:25:09	@TroyTruman15 which kinda sucked bc I wasn't high enough level to use it till like 20 mins ago
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-18 16:27:10	@TroyTruman15 lol, I just wanted to get my word across. And it wouldn't fit in 140 characters. I wasn't expecting a response
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-17 01:59:49	That was one of the most intense games I have ever played. My ankles all cut up but it was fun enough to be worth it.
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-17 03:56:45	God knows, you're lookin' good enough
but you're so smooth and the world's so rough
You might have somethin' to loooose
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-17 03:57:26	Oh, no, pretty mama, what you gonna 
do in those shoes?🎶
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-17 04:06:54	@NebbyMan I don't... What?.. That's so random... I just.... I don't know man...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-17 04:08:49	@NebbyMan well I mean I got that much
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-17 20:42:08	I never wanted to die like this... If only I had not ramen...😵
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-18 19:18:05	@QuintonBabcock i didnt mean to, it was autocorrect :(
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-17 20:29:01	“@Madison_Grace9: In desperate need of more cash flow 😩” same rt
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-17 20:31:59	Help! I'm out of ramen!!!
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-18 14:52:15	I started playing destiny at about 8 last night... I just stopped. I've been playing destiny for the past 14 hours....
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-19 14:43:47	I could have sworn I was wearing a shirt when I went to bed last night.... Where's my shirt?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-19 14:52:55	@letsquotecomedy @RioJanellex so in a course of 23 years he grew a shirt, a hoodie, and a hat...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-20 02:10:42	@Girlzwantz @angie_rollins pretty sure makeup hit her like a truck, not puberty
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-20 03:14:14	I have 2 goals for tomorrow 
1. Don't miss the buss in the morning again
2. Don't miss #PuckupLinesTuesday again like you did last week
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-20 03:16:50	@OMGreggila maybe I don't plan on talking about a bus tomorrow!!!
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-20 03:43:43	Bought $20 worth of ramen today... That should last me about a week
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-20 21:08:16	I get too passionate about things sometimes...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-21 01:40:43	Can you give me a picture of you? I searched for an image of perfection and google let me down...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-21 01:44:12	I didn't forget #PickupLineTuesday!!!
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-21 02:02:11	I'm playing this little game called life, and I want you to be the pink stud sitting next to me in my car😘
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-21 02:06:20	@Madison_Grace9 yeah I was distracted. It was a sad moment when on Wednesday I realized I missed it
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-21 02:08:46	You wanna make some blue and pink studs with me?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-21 02:27:10	I don't really like what shows up in my mirror. Would you mind standing behind a piece if glass for me? That'd be much better
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-21 02:28:03	@Madison_Grace9 @ShelbieMorghan that sparkly eye shadow though!!!
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-21 02:35:17	@Madison_Grace9 @ShelbieMorghan 10/10. My eyes have been blessed
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-21 02:59:29	Roses are red

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-21 03:42:23	@trrhyans I don't know either of these people but the fact that my tweet was used in that way was very satisfying
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-22 05:12:28	She's kinda perfect...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-22 17:36:20	@JakeGruben I feel the same. Our minds are literally twining right now
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-23 15:47:05	Me+salt=happy

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-23 16:04:30	@sims215 I went to the march for life at DC did I not tell you? That's why I missed our game. Curious as to how that ended btw
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-23 16:07:07	@sims215 I look forward to our next game!!!
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-23 01:09:26	@brower_maia I'd retweet this but you're to gorgeous. I don't wanna make anyone jelly

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-28 02:40:26	I sent my friend a picture of your face, and she tear'd up because she thought her inside camera was on and her dreams just came true

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-28 03:26:16	@marissapezzino @macycampbellxo I was gonna say who would be against your style?

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-29 03:00:18	My only tweets people enjoy reading are 40% #PickupLineTuesday tweets, 30% tweets about ramen, and 30% my stupid replies to other's tweets
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-29 03:07:06	Seriously tho. I bought $20 worth of ramen packets the other day

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-01-29 13:08:43	Nothing like a two hour delay and a cup of tea in the morning to make you feel good
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-01 21:36:07	I swear 94% of all texts I receive from @OMGreggila have exclamation points in them, haha
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-01 21:41:05	@OMGreggila lol, no it's great I love it, haha😅

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 03:01:09	Remember when you were younger and you thought you were too cool for the wii remote straps... Look what's cool now http://t.co/ekNwUDD6NX
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 03:07:37	My favorite commercial was the one at half time... You know the Nintendo commercial 😉 http://t.co/CF1juMJmle
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 03:21:25	In rehearsals she mested up her lip syncing and threw the mic. So the director gave her the #NintendoRestriction http://t.co/IiELFufs9G
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 03:25:31	@arian_hayes you've been saving this tweet all day haven't you...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 03:40:01	How many times can I tweet about the wii strap before people start unfollowing me?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 03:46:22	Pre-order just sing for the Wii-U and you'll get an authentic replica http://t.co/0xGJhiAHFR
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 04:09:06	I need to stop tweeting these. But just like Katy Perry's mic... I can't drop it http://t.co/CCdVeA0rWJ
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 04:32:23	@trrhyans my bad... I actually did a total of 9...😳

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-01 04:33:24	When two friends tweet about you at like the same exact time. But one @'s you and one subtweets http://t.co/qnZilXtcnd
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-03 03:24:08	@brower_maia sleep deprivation does that to yah, haha😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 02:51:10	@alexisnicole334 @tlmartin_20 you did notice she had a pole up her butt and a waistband on right. She was locked in pretty tight..
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 02:57:54	@ShelbieMorghan 
me before😐
Me right when i saw it😑
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 03:02:29	And Xbox fans say the wiis technology is outdated. Here we are 6 years later. And it's still the safest strap http://t.co/ulKg8DQvBH
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 03:03:18	Sorry but I just can't get over this....

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 03:32:00	I'm sorry.. Did you drop your mic? Well Katy Perry didn't! #NintendoRepresent http://t.co/AcT8BGPF2D
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 03:36:16	@MarquardtTyler that wii strap tho
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 13:56:49	@msfoxycomets it was a typo, Hun. It autocorrected to nested when I messed up, then I changed the N to a M. After it was sent I saw the "st"
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 03:39:21	When your mommy tells you to tighten your strap so you don't brake the furniture... http://t.co/qj3nZMYiIJ
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 04:06:52	@TroyTruman15 @metcalf44 love how you kinda just ignored this statement and kept tweeting😂
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 04:09:35	Lol, ok I'm done
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 04:20:01	Lol, my twitter notifications are a legit hour behind rn
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 04:24:28	“@Markeverhardt: You can't stop me you can only hope to contain me” -my Katy Perry tweets
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 04:29:10	Lol, I had too much fun with the Katy Perry jokes... Someone shoulda stopped me before I got to 8😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-01 05:14:22	-What time is it?
-A quarter note past the eighth measure🎼😛
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-01 05:22:11	@Skylar_J I'm sorry Jake Mcwhat? That is quite a name..
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-01 05:24:27	@Skylar_J his name gets me... Confused
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-01 05:33:18	@Skylar_J the first thing I saw was sexual assault controversies
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-01 05:37:42	@zacharyferguso3 well that escalated quickly...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 16:59:35	I've used this emoji so much😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 17:03:49	You're most used emoji tells a lot about you. 
DM me your most frequent emoji
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 17:07:50	@Madison_Grace9 sounds like you're gonna have a fun day😂
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 17:14:42	@Madison_Grace9 @Chloe_Kouts lol, I'm sure you aren't the only ones. Gotta make sure you didn't miss any good jokes😂
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-02 17:17:53	Stalking people's twitter isnt creepy in my opinion. You're just catching up on what you missed, we all do it. If you say you don't, you lie
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-03 12:47:06	@mykateisname saaaaame
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-03 12:48:58	I just favorited a tweet in 5 secs. And replied in 20... I think that's a record
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-03 12:58:37	@Madison_Grace9 lol, we don't always close.. We just close more than you😜
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-04 02:48:26	If anyone wants to get in on #PickupLineTuesday go for it
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-04 03:13:37	I'm a fan of you. And you're the electricity that powers me and keeps me going
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-04 03:31:24	@alexisnicole334 lol, use a pickup line on some random hobo then
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-04 03:54:31	🎤I came in like a wrecking balllll!!
All I wanted was to kiss you're faceee🎶
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-04 05:02:12	@Chloe_Kouts put your hair in a bun, throw a brick in the air, and try to catch it with your head. That'll help you sleep
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-04 03:23:52	All I want is you, me, and a bag of popcorn to munch on as I watch my favorite movie. "The blushing goddess"
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-04 03:26:05	You're the blushing goddess... Just incase you googled blushing goddess and got confused as to why there was no movie...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-04 03:30:21	@alexisnicole334 tis the day for it
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-04 03:44:04	Heaven called. It wants it's angel back
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-04 04:25:22	Geez!! You look like an elephant stomped on your face... But your personality makes up for it 😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-04 04:28:56	@brower_maia pshh, someone out there would appreciate it. They can't all be ascetic compliments
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-04 04:31:20	@brower_maia not gonna lie to someone... Don't wanna build a relationship on lies
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-04 04:48:08	I'd rather go on a date with you then have school close tomorrow😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-04 03:30:06	@alexisnicole334 send him a pickup line. See how he responds
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-05 02:07:11	A sign made by my #wcw

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-07 02:46:31	Teenagers in relationships these days kiss way too much. If you're kissing someone every time you say goodbye, it just loses it's meaning...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-07 02:48:32	But that just a really strange, abnormal, behind the times thing that I like to call my opinion
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-07 02:49:46	@H_Hayess_ @awkwardposts lol, I get that on #PickupLineTuesday from time to time
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-07 02:55:25	@audreyxXxmarie @BaysCrystal they counted my vote as like twenty. Bc I'm that influential 😏😉

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-10 02:39:34	What's your favorite video game from when you were younger? You don't even have to reply to me if you don't wanna, just think about it
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-11 14:10:32	Fisher- "Woah, Tanner your hands are soo soft. Like, they are intensely soft."
2 mins later "Like I could make a blanket out of your hands."
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-10 02:48:35	You know how sometimes someone'll tweet something and you'll wait a bit before you favorite it so you don't seem creepy? Yeah, I don't wait
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-10 02:52:44	@NebbyMan that's awesome 😊
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-10 02:58:47	You know how sometimes you tryin to tweet then you start to hit the chractr cap. So you grammar get bad an the words get real shrt n all tht
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-10 03:01:32	@OMGreggila if I had a dollar for everyone I had on notifications that doesn't have it on for me...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-10 03:03:39	@OMGreggila lol, nah I got you
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-10 03:07:13	@OMGreggila lol, not sure why I have you on notifications bc you rarely tweet. But you've been on pretty much since you followed me
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-10 03:54:28	Ok, so a potato and a cat walk into a bar. The cat says meow, then in response the potato says.... Nothing. Potatoes can't talk

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-11 03:14:43	You're so sweet to me. If life is a pancake then you're the maple syrup. You make the pancake worth eating, and life worth living
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-11 22:51:37	Drinking tea from a functioning mug you made in art class is so satisfying
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-11 03:35:18	I keep seeing this poster of a guy who looks like he desperately wants to be with you... Oh wait those were all mirrors
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-11 04:21:48	D'you read the autobiography about the guy that asked out the love of his life on a day just like today?
No?
Probly bc I didn't write it yet
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-12 02:17:07	@alexisnicole334 it's ok chem buddy. When you're feeling ignored just take all your Bundy homework and cry in a corner. That's what I do
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-12 02:20:39	Only two goals were scored while I was on the field... As a defender I'd say that's a very successful game
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-12 02:23:00	Shoutout to @goalieswag10 for the great game!!!
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-10 13:28:34	@alexisnicole334 lol, what's that even feel like?😜
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-12 02:48:11	You ever get in the shower then you just never wanna get out bc it feels too darn good
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-12 02:54:40	@JakeGruben @sims215 @rvsidle98 there's a reason he's like the #1 least liked ref in the county
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-12 02:58:53	How to get favorites from @JakeGruben:
1. Tweet about ramen
2. Tweet about a warm shower
3.#PickupLinesTuesday 
4. Complain about a ref
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-12 03:28:21	@brower_maia your forgot about
"Memory Erase Saturday" 

See what I did there😜
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-13 03:29:11	If I tweeted #ramen every time I ate ramen your timeline would be full of just that. And #ramen would be trending world wide
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-13 03:52:18	Someone help me... I suck at being a teenager, I have the lingo of a 30 year old
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-12 22:17:15	Been studying 6 pages of pretty much solid highlighter for about 3 hours now #TheatreProblems
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-10 20:15:09	Just saw a woman drop a fry in her scarf. She spent like 3 mins looking for it, and mentally I was rolling on the floor laughing inside
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-11 20:53:28	When your twitter is too active and twitter wants to email you everything http://t.co/AqCQbtHqBD
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-14 22:44:54	@Chloe_Kouts hate to see a friend upset. Even if we aren't too terribly close
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-14 22:15:28	So this level three completely ruined my plans for today.... Winter is mean to me

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-18 19:00:03	@ShelbieMorghan @Madison_Grace9 and Obama used to not look super old
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-18 19:04:49	@ShelbieMorghan @Madison_Grace9 my hair used to go to my shoulders
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-18 19:05:57	@Madison_Grace9 @ShelbieMorghan lol, good. I like it that way😂
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-18 03:57:22	You.. Me... And some FIFA...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-18 03:59:12	Hey, I was working out a lot yesterday so my arm is a little sore. Would you mind holding my hand for me?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-18 04:17:21	Oh no... I think my heart just stopped... Can you put your head on my chest and listen for it? For like... A long while?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-19 12:23:08	@mykateisname and I finished my poems and everything
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-20 04:17:05	Neat
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-21 06:41:23	My eyes are so dry rn it's insane
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-21 06:41:45	Spit in my eye
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-21 06:46:24	Jk, that's gross. But my eyes are still suuuper dry
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-22 05:36:17	Lol, I am not afraid to send 5-9 messages in a row while texting
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-22 10:01:32	@brower_maia were dumb and should probably go to sleep now... But we probably won't
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 01:41:51	Please don't let me get you sick
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 03:30:51	Chasing Cars -Snow Patrol
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 03:36:14	@angie_rollins lol, you only know a handful of them. There are billions out there. You care for only as much as 3 grains of sand on a beach
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 03:39:41	@angie_rollins yeah, I feel like a handful is a huge overstatement. And honestly the average # of true friends a person has only 2-3
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 03:40:16	@angie_rollins and that's a good healthy number. It's not too much. Just enough to satisfy your soul
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 03:41:56	@angie_rollins haha, I feel what you mean. I try to care for everyone deserving. And I try to imagine every one deserves to be cared for
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 03:44:03	@angie_rollins lol, that's completely understandable
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 04:00:36	@savannah_deleon 🙌 ladies need to take note of this tweet
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 04:04:25	Lol, that moment when a popular person accidentaly follows you then instantly unfollows you😂
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 04:07:12	Or when someone follows you just to get a follow back then unfollows you... Like wow... I see how it is
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 04:08:12	@BigbyHoule @TroyTruman15 curb stomp his face
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 04:11:25	@BigbyHoule lol, are you in that mood on twitter where you just get obnoxious and reply comments to all kinda of tweets... Bc I may be...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 04:11:52	@BigbyHoule and you seem to be
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 04:12:58	@sims215 @Markeverhardt bro you look really pale in that picture. You should get outside and tan more
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 04:25:56	Yup... I need to eat some ramen...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 04:28:36	Love that jake never fails to fav when I tweet about ramen. It's like he hacked twitter to notify him only my tweets with the word ramen
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 04:31:49	@JakeGruben that or it's an insane coincidence
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-23 04:45:53	@JakeGruben that seriously made my night #RamenIsLove #RamenIsLife
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-25 03:15:16	I may be off to a late start, but I'm here #PickupLinesTueaday
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-25 03:29:18	Are you seeing what I'm seeing rn? Bc rn I'm looking in your eyes and I see some guy who couldn't be happier about what's in front if him
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-25 04:35:30	@TroyTruman15 I really like this picture. Not gonna lie
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-26 03:20:18	Award for strangest conversations ever had over text goes to me!!!
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-26 03:25:44	Don't you love when you're comfortable enough with a person that you can talk about things with them you couldn't imagine with someone else
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-26 17:11:21	@tlmartin_20 C lunch finally has a benefit
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-25 03:22:18	Or better yet since you're the girl here
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-25 04:11:18	It's 11:11 and all I wish for is you
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-25 04:56:35	@angie_rollins go on strike
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-27 03:04:45	I like my coffee with only my sugar. No creamer. I'm a one condiment coffee kinda guy
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-27 03:06:51	@Madison_Grace9 I drink black most the time. But if it's not good coffee you have to put sugar in it to balance it out
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-27 03:07:18	@Madison_Grace9 black coffee is only good strong. If its weak you have to put something in it
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-27 03:13:33	@Madison_Grace9 haha, I have my reasons for things😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-27 03:54:44	The question is. Where is this chicks arms and legs? Who is wearing this dress. If there even is anyone wearing this dress...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-25 03:20:02	I'd trade a full charge of battery life on my phone for a date with you😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-25 03:23:04	You, me, a date. What's in it for you? I'll bring a phone charger for you
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-27 04:16:01	Fav.  if you don't care about the color
Rt.  if you just want to know where her arms and legs are http://t.co/36APf7b7kq
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-27 04:22:23	@Madison_Grace9 I'm trying to confuse people
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-25 03:41:05	You ever been at the store and there's all these clothes but one thing sticks out. And you're just like, "Woah!.. I need that"
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-25 03:41:26	You stick out... I need you
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-26 01:25:46	@OMGreggila I couldn't do this session bc of the play I'm in. But you can go see that. And I will probably go watch a bunch of games
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-26 01:35:17	@OMGreggila 8 on Friday and Saturday 2 on Sunday
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-26 01:36:37	@OMGreggila that's ok
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-27 23:23:16	Haha happy peaches are better peaches
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-26 02:10:34	"I fixed it😁" -you'd find this so funny if you knew the inside joke
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-26 02:59:20	Inside jokes &gt; life
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-26 04:38:48	"Ok. I'll do my best. For you"
This is all you should expect from a person. And it should satisfy you no matter what
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-28 22:47:42	@audreyxXxmarie lol, I'm almost always the one that falls asleep 😔😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-02-28 22:49:55	@audreyxXxmarie haha, I can relate

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-03 17:43:31	@trevdep just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-03 17:46:52	@trevdep Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-03 17:48:19	@trevdep *starts drumming* finish it!
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-01 16:24:17	When a girl blushes it has to be one of the cutest things in the entire world
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-02 01:40:40	@GenoaDramaClub I lost the stage bae
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-02 02:10:59	@GenoaDramaClub the ultimate betrayal😭

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-02 02:24:10	@spencermmullins I'm ruined now😭
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-02 02:26:15	@spencermmullins @Markeverhardt lol you photoshopped your face on another man

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-02 03:02:34	@Markeverhardt when the ladies blowing up your DM's http://t.co/XSxfk6k4pu
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-02 03:02:54	@Markeverhardt and you forgot to turn of emails
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-02 03:26:23	Being dumb with friends is my favorite pastime
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-03 14:59:38	@brandongh_419 it's too late now😔
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-03 15:08:13	@brandongh_419 it says 7 to 10 bruh
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-03 15:08:30	@brandongh_419 ughhhhh. I thought it said 10 am
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-03 15:08:36	@brandongh_419 that's insane
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-03 15:10:43	@brandongh_419 hmmm... I'll see what I can do. No promises
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 12:44:29	You ever stay up way too late on a school night bc you're having a lovely conversation? Or maybe rather one that's really important to you?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 14:20:28	@Chloe_Kouts same. But I also hate going. I say we just don't have school ever and both problems are solved
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-03 15:25:28	@brandongh_419 yeah... The roads are pretty bad man...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-06 15:13:43	@angie_rollins is it a 4 or 5?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-06 15:32:47	@angie_rollins aww, I need a 4 charger
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-06 02:16:52	When she sends nudes😏

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-06 02:22:49	@Markeverhardt @Bshan2143 you guys should get married. That response time tho http://t.co/i5TfL6QHVE
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-06 04:33:56	No One Like You -Scorpions
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 00:40:15	#PickupLinesTueaday anyone?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 00:46:45	I want you to explore every inch of my mouth with your tongue while I simply just enjoy your presence there
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 01:01:02	Character caps annoy me sometimes...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 01:10:34	@GenoaDramaClub lol, it's not even done yet. I didn't get to put funny ones in there
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 01:11:51	@GenoaDramaClub and the second one wasn't me. Someone DM'd it and I tweeted it
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 01:15:18	Are you a Mr. Clean magic eraser? Because when I look at you everything else is erased out of my mind
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 01:15:55	@GenoaDramaClub haha, too descriptive for your taste 😂😘
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 01:21:57	Do you know what you'd be if you were a vegetable?
A cute-cumber
Why'd I tell this joke?
To-mate-o
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 01:23:32	@GenoaDramaClub ok, you have to love my forth one
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 01:51:07	Me without you is like a shoe without laces, a die with no faces, asentancewithnospaces
Kinda useless
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 01:57:20	Not every pickup line of mine is a keeper, and they aren't all winners. But if I could get a real keeper like you, then I'd be a real winner
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 01:59:38	It only takes one successful pickup line to not be able to use another one ever again
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 02:59:58	I swear, I wasn't starring at your breasts. I was just trying to find the quickest way to your heart
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 03:03:24	I swear, I wasn't grabbing your butt. You stole my heart and I was just feeling to see if you put it in your back pocket
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 03:07:26	@OMGreggila lol, it's all for comedic purposes
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 03:13:37	@Madison_Grace9 @Chloe_Kouts lol, the fact I had to search for what frfr meant😥😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 03:15:39	@Chloe_Kouts @Madison_Grace9 haha, I may be clever with some of these lines. But I'm still an old man whose behind the times at heart
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 03:19:05	@TroyTruman15 haha, the things I come up with for some chuckles
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 03:20:19	@TroyTruman15 I slay a nice bowl of ramen
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 03:23:04	@TroyTruman15 lol, yessssss
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 03:24:21	@TroyTruman15: u slay the ladies and that is all that matters
Me: idk about that, but I slay a nice bowl of ramen
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 03:45:42	I could list all the things I love about you but it'd take me days to complete. And that's without taking breaks to sleep or eat
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-04 03:54:39	Honestly can't remember why I first started #PickupLinesTuesday pretty sure I was just hanging at a friends and was really bored
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-07 03:40:46	Ramen is my side chick
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-06 11:51:21	Insomnia has been kicking my butt lately. I can't even open my eyes for longer than 14 secs
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-08 05:37:43	When you DM a ton of people for late night laughs and only 3 respond http://t.co/VB3pLS24fE
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-08 15:01:39	Im so dumb. If you're snapping me. Please excuse my strange sense of humor😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-08 20:36:30	I don't want to leave my bed ever...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-08 20:40:36	@tinyk99 lol, that must have counted for quite it if follower points bc I can't remember a tweet I've favorited since😂😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-08 20:29:38	@tinyk99 lol, not gonna lie. I'm not sure why I'm so high up. I mean we talked and messed around that one day but that was awhile ago, haha
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-08 20:41:48	@tinyk99 *a lot of* follower points*
Glad to be up there tho, haha😅😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-09 19:06:02	I just want to eat some ice cream right now...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-10 02:15:28	@Markeverhardt and when did you stop using the at night picture? http://t.co/VRtsilGavL
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-10 02:17:31	A bowl of ramen is always better http://t.co/yATOXGxxl7
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-10 19:23:46	We played hangman in study hall for like a hour today and I went undefeated😏
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-11 12:33:11	It's too late to close guys. The busses are already sent out...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-11 12:38:37	I feel like everyone riding the bus is gonna be late to school bc they're gonna have to be driving so slow
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-11 02:17:16	Reasons to date me
1: no one will try to steal me
2: I'm funny sometimes
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-11 02:18:33	Reasons not to date me
1:
2:
3:
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-11 02:24:17	You don't think I'm good enough? Well then I guess I'll just have to cut off my left hand, bc that would surely make me right for you
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-11 02:46:31	I may just be a lame dork...
But I could be your lame dork😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-11 02:50:57	@TroyTruman15 did you see some of mine last week? They got pretty sexual
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-11 02:52:37	@TroyTruman15 I swear Troy. I like you. http://t.co/RwY4kVUN43
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-11 02:57:08	@TroyTruman15 @JakeGruben can someone say sexy http://t.co/uJzMgfbzIf
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-11 03:00:33	@TroyTruman15 @JakeGruben I know right. Jakes face tho. Like I accidentally tape on the picture. And got scared right outta my pants
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-11 03:06:55	I want to kiss you until you forget what your own saliva taste like
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-11 03:23:42	@NebbyMan haha, it's supposed to be disturbing
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-11 03:25:53	People always get creeped out when I do the disturbing overly detailed kissing lines, and I feel so successful bc that's what I was goin for

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-14 02:38:18	I watched Maia perform today, and she was lovely😍
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-14 03:00:17	One if the best things about when a girl doesn't wear makeup is that you can see her cheeks genuinely, naturally blushing.. It's the best😋

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-15 04:14:33	It's gonna be one of those night where I don't sleep, drink a case of mountain, and play video games for hours on end with a friend

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-25 14:35:05	Just realized I missed pickup like Tuesday... That's upsetting I had a really funny one ready
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-26 02:57:33	I know it's not Tuesday but for you I'd break my own rules just this one time #PickupLineWednesday
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-26 03:01:20	You remember that one time when I missed pickup line Tuesday? Yeah it was bc I didn't see you that day...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-26 03:04:14	Why is there a D in Wednesday? It doesn't make sense to me. But there is somewhere i think my D would make sense being😉😘

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-26 03:22:30	I usually avoid making dirty pickup lines but I love how when I do some people freak out. It's hilarious to me😂😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-27 01:22:56	"Hey Wonka, what's that loompy doompy doing?"
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-27 01:30:43	So many Oompa Loompas on the stage I feel like a very successful carrot farmer
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-28 00:31:38	Day 2 of successful carrot farmer's log:
I seem to have grown a new carrot.. There's one more fresh ripe dancing carrot than last night...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-28 00:55:06	Someone in the audience called my carrots Oompa Loompas... Don't know why... That's a really dumb name for a dancing singing carrot
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-28 01:35:15	Did Charlie just jump out of the flying elevator😳
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-28 01:36:11	I guess this story ends with a suicidal dead Charlie bucket...😣😢

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-03-29 16:20:34	When you don't even have to ask, your girlfriend just sincerely wants to go to church with you🙌😍

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-04-01 01:31:08	Beef jerky is expensive. If you can have it all to yourself... You're a lucky man

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-04-11 04:45:24	I hate when a mistake you made a month ago effects you in the present and there's absolutely nothing you can do to fix it....
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-04-11 21:57:25	My mom gossips more than a middle schooler...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-04-11 21:58:39	Spreads word to everyone she knows before she even knows things for fact. Making rumors worse than they are...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-04-11 21:59:29	I thought all girls grew out of that kind of childness eventually...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-04-11 16:44:28	There's a large Mexican family of like 30 right next to me and I'm pretty sure the one little boys name is cowboy... That's a sweet name

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-07 00:58:15	@alexisnicole334 when your timeline is full of fav for hdm's http://t.co/km0AgeZ8LN
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-07 01:02:46	Cutest thug I've ever seen http://t.co/k3xvJM0uv3
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-08 03:15:00	@KevBaumgartner haha, I see. I see. But none of your friends even know who I am, so drama involving me wouldn't be too entertaining😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-08 19:21:26	I thought you wouldn't want to text me if you didn't know my name. Yet you continue
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-08 19:25:45	@brower_maia lol, it's a joke subterranean but I don't think Madison is putting together the puzzle pieces
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-08 19:50:44	@brower_maia lol, autocorrect sometimes
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-08 19:51:36	@Sw3gDaddy @Madison_Grace9 haha, you think she ever would have figured it out without your help?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-08 19:56:37	@Madison_Grace9 @Sw3gDaddy but like, he led you to my subtweet
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-08 01:54:53	@imeyesack tell me about it
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-08 02:15:02	@imeyesack @audrey_imholt I have the lines down. It's just a couple spots of timing. That comes with going it over with people at practice
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-08 02:15:45	@imeyesack @audrey_imholt practice makes perfect my friend. Plus some of those make no sense so it's hard to logically remember the timing
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-08 02:17:29	@imeyesack @audrey_imholt yup and I've gotten them every other play so actions have spoken😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-08 02:18:43	@imeyesack @audrey_imholt lol, shows not over yet😂
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-08 02:38:02	@imeyesack others had missed their lines bc theyre so small they're easy to forget and I had memorized the order of my lines off their cues
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-08 02:39:46	@imeyesack busy writing a script thanks for the advice tho😘
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-08 02:40:50	@imeyesack and there is a difference between arguing just to be rude and argue, and arguing to defend yourself
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-08 02:41:30	@imeyesack lol, I'm not in the script I'm writing so I got sure wont memorize it😂
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-09 20:56:56	@kyleigh_p you hardly have a dress code girl
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-09 20:58:10	@JakeGruben Star Wars 3?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-09 21:16:00	@JakeGruben thats what it sounds like
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-10 06:01:08	@kyleigh_p lol, so exactly what I said. You hardly have a dress code
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-10 06:16:17	@ShelbieMorghan same
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-13 02:04:23	@jessiffland you may be struggling to stay up but... Never mind. I was gonna make a sexual Pickup line and then I decided it's too bad
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-13 02:09:23	When the alcohols don't work you just threaten the girl. 

*knife at throat* so, about that date tomorrow 😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-13 02:11:34	*looks at girl*
Holy shit is it a nice day not to be blind
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-13 02:18:35	Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk past you a couple more times?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-13 02:23:50	@JakeGruben ok if a lightning bolt hits a hawk the hawk is dead. No contest
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-13 03:01:13	@Madison_Grace9 just never sleep
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-14 02:00:35	@KevBaumgartner *unfollows*
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-14 02:02:05	@KevBaumgartner I have bad ones and good ones. Bad ones for the giggles. And good ones for the singles
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-14 02:03:34	@KevBaumgartner people love my #PickupLineTuesday's I get complaints the occasional Tuesday that I forget to do them

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-13 02:07:23	Would you like to go on a date with me? *handing girl even more alcohol*
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-13 02:10:27	@JakeGruben half of what you consume can be me if you'd like😉😉😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-13 02:59:28	@Madison_Grace9 never. Be a good girl!!!!
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-15 03:01:11	It's mixed emotions when she falls asleep and I'm glad she's getting some rest but at the same time I kinda wanna talk more...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-16 03:41:19	@Sw3gDaddy dude, I have some fire works but my mommy won't let me have a lighter so if you could fill in that end I'd love to bang
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-16 03:49:17	This is a great read if you play soccer, wether in reality or playing FIFA on your console

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-17 04:27:12	@omg_lexi99 @audrey_imholt look at him beg for mercy, when it's mercy that should be begging for him

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-17 04:52:51	It's like a great mustached lion dragging away a wounded gazelle
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-17 04:53:18	What great instincts crawling away from the net like that!!

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-17 05:20:40	“@DoYouScience: Have you ever seen a rocket leaving Earth's atmosphere? http://t.co/zV4WVp86VQ”👀😍
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-17 05:54:30	@tinyk99 @trevdep well this conversation devolved
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-17 12:16:01	I didn't fall asleep until like 3. And my body decides it's a great idea to make me wake up at 7:30....
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-17 13:44:32	@OMGreggila no, I love when you say stuff like that😊
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-17 17:03:27	I like long dresses because they are really good at showing off those natural curves😍
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-17 17:42:38	@brower_maia I told you to finish that pizza
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-18 02:18:00	@ShelbieMorghan awww, no Shelbs that's saddening
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-18 03:12:25	@RioJanellex late night Denny's is always bad😂
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-18 19:47:30	If your girl buys you beef jerky keep her
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-18 22:21:23	@Chloe_Kouts well now that I've told you about my experience being molested you may nap
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-18 19:21:21	@ShelbieMorghan *stares at the sky*
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-18 20:51:43	@jessiffland if this is a subtweet. I think it'd be the most intense subtweet I've ever seen
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-18 21:57:37	@Chloe_Kouts lol, since when is this a thing?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-19 02:36:58	@kyleigh_p I can't take the amount of coolness
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-19 02:37:32	@kyleigh_p plus unlike a lot of people. You and your baby self aren't too different looking
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-19 22:37:01	@sims215 hey you know how I said like 60% of Tim Cahill's goals were headers?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-20 03:23:44	@audrey_imholt lol I commented without favoriting last time... I guess its proven history really does repeat itself😂
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-20 03:26:25	@audrey_imholt I wouldn't without permission, haha
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-20 03:27:46	@audrey_imholt hey it's just common courtesy. You don't go sharing pics of other people without their permission. It's rude af
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-20 03:29:21	@audrey_imholt lol, on top of all other reasons😂 I thought you just loved me for my eyebrows
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-20 03:30:46	@audrey_imholt ehh, that's debate able
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-20 03:31:40	@audrey_imholt I'm the lucky one that she hasn't left me😂
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-19 22:25:19	Today At soccer I cut open my forehead and my pinky, and i found out I was allergic to grass when my arms and legs became covered in hives..
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-19 22:25:38	But I got a hat trick so over all good day
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-19 22:38:10	@sims215 put a corner kick in to this guy and you got goals for days http://t.co/WE3Hq73m3N
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-19 22:39:16	@sims215 you can't say that isin't impressive sims!!!
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-21 01:45:29	Every time I have to tell someone "no, I can't hang out with you" it kills me inside
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-21 01:49:16	@Chloe_Kouts ... *dies inside*
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-21 01:52:12	@Chloe_Kouts @TroyTruman15 ... I'm sorry. I don't mean it. I'm not trying to be rude
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-21 01:54:20	@TroyTruman15 @Chloe_Kouts headers for days http://t.co/OL4gvWlQAO
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-21 01:55:34	@TroyTruman15 put a corner into this mans head and you have a goal every time. You can't say those stats aren't impressive
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-21 01:57:27	@Chloe_Kouts I love you tho❤
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-21 01:58:48	@TroyTruman15 more like springs. That trash can got hops
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-21 02:42:04	@trevdep and even less often you're left tweetless
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-22 01:53:11	I really wish I had more control over my life...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-22 02:27:57	I honestly don't think you understand how important you are to me...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-21 21:26:24	@brandongh_419 bro. We should go to the park sometime

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-23 20:13:29	Ate a large bowl of cereal. Some tea. And a bowl of ramen. Bc I just needed food
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-22 22:18:12	@JakeGruben @Bshan2143 I feel like you've been waiting till summer so you could say this without offending @macycampbellxo
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-24 02:55:27	@RioJanellex ugh, first diet then mcchicken. I'm not sure we can be friends anymore
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-24 02:57:45	@arian_hayes if smoking is what I gotta do to get the ladies to leave me alone then you just inspired me to start smoking
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-24 03:00:21	@RioJanellex I've worked at McDonald's.... Everything
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-24 03:01:05	Jk, it's better than the grilled chicken. That stuffs nasty. I'm just not a fan
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-24 03:02:16	Is it strange that I enjoy the fact I occasionally have to pull your hair out of my clothes?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-23 00:28:17	@RioJanellex that's sass. I didn't add the ay
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-22 22:22:42	@RioJanellex you're gross. Diet is gross. So you're gross for being gross bc you like gross stuff. Gross

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-25 04:01:48	@Madison_Grace9 "talking" is the stupidest term ever
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-25 04:04:37	@Madison_Grace9 haha, he afraid you'll ruin his chances of being a player with the other ladies
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-25 04:06:14	@Madison_Grace9 haha, not all guys strive to be players tho. I hate that being a player is even a thing
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-25 04:09:18	@Madison_Grace9 haha, when shelbie first met me she didn't talk to me bc she thought I was a player bc of how I looked and my confidence
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-25 04:09:44	@Madison_Grace9 then she got to know me and we laughed about how wrong she was
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-25 04:10:47	@Madison_Grace9 haha, it happens
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-25 04:12:26	@Chloe_Kouts @Madison_Grace9 haha you've been stalking this conversation with favs for awhile. I was curious hot long till you joined

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-26 02:42:40	@JakeGruben bruh. Look at my tweet about my new cleats. Any thoughts?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-26 02:44:06	@JakeGruben just bc you're the only guy on twitter rn that cares about cleats and I want opinions before I get them
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-26 02:44:39	@JakeGruben but they're durable. Nike falls apart
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-26 02:47:53	@JakeGruben I used to have a white and purple Adidas ball with like gold accents but it disappeared end of last season, it woulda matched...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-26 02:53:15	Fav ball I've ever owned but it disappeared one day... Upsetting http://t.co/Ewfdy618E5
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-26 02:53:34	@JakeGruben lol, I guess it wasn't Adidas😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-26 02:56:52	@JakeGruben haha, for the one season they're still in one piece, If that
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-26 02:59:40	@MarquardtTyler @JakeGruben quite defending Nike. It's so bad
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-26 03:03:39	@JakeGruben lol, I was right the first time😅 http://t.co/4Eo8XDU1RG
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-26 03:04:46	Haha, I just google my old ball to find out the brand😅 you'd think I'd have better things to do
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-26 03:08:00	Saw these cleats and was like. Wow. I want. Then I saw they were $300 http://t.co/9GQet5Zmn5
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-26 03:08:46	@Madison_Grace9 if you pay half
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-25 02:27:02	@Chloe_Kouts you've been up at 6 tweeting Moines awake the last two days. It's only a three hour difference
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-25 02:35:51	@Chloe_Kouts lol, no. My haha got autocorrect end to just hah. I've never typed just hah in my entire life😅
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-25 02:38:25	@Chloe_Kouts haha, I feel great actually. But thanks for the concern there
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-25 11:41:05	I watched a movie with my girlfriend for her birthday Saturday, and it was pretty much the best time ever
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-25 12:48:23	Some guy kept rematching me in soccer stars and I beat him 12 times in a row, haha
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-27 03:55:38	@CauseWereGuys @TroyTruman15 they can't ever find sweat bands that fit? http://t.co/pg3jSX0QRA
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-27 03:59:18	@TroyTruman15 @CauseWereGuys I figured😂
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-27 04:02:37	You know what they say about guys with big foreheads #pickuplinetuesday http://t.co/Jb8s8nkdCJ
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-27 04:07:15	@Sw3gDaddy they look weird in visors
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-27 04:07:41	@Sw3gDaddy or sexy it's opinionated
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-27 09:08:34	I love how we can comfortably talk about anything really
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-26 02:31:04	Might get these cleats bc.... Well I mean look at them😍 http://t.co/QQDRxuKLVT
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-28 02:03:07	😒- the emoji of being annoyed but not voicing your opinion
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-28 02:08:11	There is a right and a wring time to voice your opinion. Some people don't understand it, but sometimes it's better to keep quiet.
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-28 03:01:31	@zacharyferguso3 @audrey_imholt I enjoyed it. These pictures remind me why you're one of my favorite leaving seniors
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-28 04:39:16	@Rera_Luvs_Pie would you mind giving your sister a hug and telling her it's from me please?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-28 04:47:01	I sneezed so mound I woke up Trevor....
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-28 04:47:20	He mumbled then fell back asleep...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-28 04:53:09	@trrhyans so loud* lol. I guess I sneezed out the part of my brain that lets me type correctly
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-29 04:57:17	Up all night listening to music that make me think of you🎧
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-29 17:29:09	@trevdep @Bshan2143 tried to do a kick flip with my car.. I don't think I've ever heard such an original and quality joke about a car crash
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-30 04:30:37	@kyleigh_p this was the highlight of my feed tonight. You are pretty darn velmae-like
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-30 04:33:13	@kyleigh_p like even just your facial structure. It makes me think of Velma. Haha, and the attitude sometimes
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-31 03:39:50	@Chloe_Kouts said everyone to themselves every night ever
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-31 03:41:16	@Skylar_J nothing at all. #YOLO
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-31 03:43:15	@Skylar_J depends how good your body is underneath those clothes😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-31 03:43:36	@Chloe_Kouts shhhhh, don't reply to me do to bed!!!!
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-31 03:44:17	@Madison_Grace9 children these days
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-31 03:46:21	@Chloe_Kouts @Madison_Grace9 climb onto your roof and attempt to dive head first into the dirt. You'll sleep like a dead rat
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-31 03:47:25	@Chloe_Kouts @Madison_Grace9 or just put away your phone. The bright light messes with your brain and it makes it harder to fall asleep
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-31 03:47:45	@Chloe_Kouts @Madison_Grace9 either works
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-31 03:52:59	@kyleigh_p @Sw3gDaddy you two. Just saying http://t.co/UKaGO4ATj2
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-31 03:53:40	@kyleigh_p @Sw3gDaddy that's a bad picture of shaggy but you get what I mean
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-05-30 22:05:37	My new cleats just came in😍 Someone needs to go play with me at the park once it gets dry
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-02 02:29:45	@jason_baker98 I got these😍 http://t.co/SjN8zeAf9y
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-03 02:32:45	@KevBaumgartner ..... I won't judge
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-03 02:33:16	@trevdep $$$$$$$ I'll be there
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-03 02:34:11	@trevdep .... Sound pretty solid
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-03 03:21:07	#PickupLineTuesday anyone? Late at night but that's when the fun happens right?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-03 03:24:48	*At cedar point*
All these roller coasters and I still want to ride you the most
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-03 03:29:50	Are you made by apple? Because i-want  you
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-03 03:37:16	I Want You
For My Girlfriend http://t.co/EY2SGBzFtH
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-03 03:41:32	@alexisnicole334 use the line. Get some dudes
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-03 03:43:31	@alexisnicole334 guys'll be like. "Girl you can ride me all you want. And guess what, no long line"
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-03 03:43:54	@alexisnicole334 wow. Ur lame. Look at my tweets
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-03 03:46:08	If anyone goes to cedar point and uses my line I want to hear about it. That'd be the best.
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-02 17:32:02	@angie_rollins lol, no. Depends on the guy
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-02 17:33:44	@angie_rollins haha, the one week later pic on the girl side would be me on the first day, one week later, and always.. Casually eating food
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-02 17:34:54	@angie_rollins usually with a smile. Bc food is something to smile about
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-02 17:36:45	@angie_rollins haha I feel like a girl made this. Bc that side is the accurate one. The other is kinda just what one would like to think
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-02 17:38:27	@angie_rollins 1/10 times I'd assume. But it'd probly be like that for 1/10 girls too
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-02 17:39:44	@angie_rollins good for you😄
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-02 17:41:12	@angie_rollins honestly the best way to revise the guys side is to put a picture of a guy playing video games in every slot available
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-02 17:41:53	@angie_rollins no relationship = more time for games. That'd be 8/10 guys
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-04 18:10:27	@brandongh_419 are the fields muddy? I wanna test out my new cleats
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-04 18:11:34	@brandongh_419 you wanna play at the park in town?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-04 18:14:13	@brandongh_419 cool. I have to mow my lawn first anyway so it works out
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-04 03:19:58	“@FutbaITweets: Retweet for Messi- R.I.P Boateng's ankles https://t.co/Il7Ju6t8rH😂😭”@sims215

2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-05 16:37:03	@JakeGruben you wanna pick me up since we're so close? If not ill walk it's not far
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-06 11:53:03	Should not have stayed up until 2 when I have an 8 hour shift in the morning...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-05 18:41:33	@Rera_Luvs_Pie ... Sorry what?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-05 18:58:06	@Rera_Luvs_Pie you should be telling her to stop not me
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-05 18:59:50	@Rera_Luvs_Pie haha, yeah I've come to realize she likes sharing stuff
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-05 19:12:46	Just fried some eggs... Mmmm😋😋
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-06 05:49:44	@brower_maia just the one time
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-06 17:35:45	@brower_maia I stayed up later after you fell asleep. Netflix got hold of me
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-06 17:37:57	@brower_maia daredevil. It was pretty good. And I'm really not that tired... It's probably all the dr. Pepper I drink here
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-07 00:17:01	@ShelbieMorghan bing met me down... Now I'll never know your snap
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-07 00:17:24	@ShelbieMorghan let me down... I guess autocorrect let me down too....
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-07 00:18:46	@ShelbieMorghan bing let me down http://t.co/u7I7AzlPOe
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-07 00:20:21	@ShelbieMorghan if only I knew Dutch...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-07 00:20:52	@ShelbieMorghan lol, that's twitters translator. It's not like I chose bing. Bing chose me
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-07 00:21:21	@ShelbieMorghan bing chooses all of us.... But none of us choose bing
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-07 00:31:54	@ShelbieMorghan shhh, what did bing ever do to you. It's not bings fault it couldn't translate you. You're a girl. Girls are confusing
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-07 01:01:39	@JakeGruben ask you mom😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-07 01:02:04	@JakeGruben she'll probably say "nothing... Sleeping I guess"
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-06 21:31:54	@zacharyferguso3 fascinating
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-08 02:59:17	@audrey_imholt @drvgfuII that's gross
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-08 03:01:42	@Bshan2143 @TroyTruman15 best thing I've seen on tweeter.... Ever probably
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-08 03:07:23	@trevdep or she'll think she's in trouble😅😂
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-07 03:56:07	@Chloe_Kouts sure you're tired😉😉
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-07 03:57:14	@Chloe_Kouts where's the emoji for acid?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-07 04:25:09	Still pretty even with a hand in front of your face http://t.co/2AM2h7Y3kS

My life is a lie
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-08 04:59:37	I really wanna watch a movie with you...
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-08 05:38:05	@Chloe_Kouts well it's only been an hour and a half and you probably feel that way bc you need to sleep, your day shouldn't start this early
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-08 05:39:43	@Chloe_Kouts I was gonna not tweet that but you had the tweet about being ignored so I was like. Ehhh, sarcasm is better than nothing
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-08 05:40:02	@Chloe_Kouts today? Or yesterday?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-08 05:42:04	@Chloe_Kouts at 1-4 I was mowing my lawn. I'm allergic to grass and it was misrable
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-08 05:43:36	@Chloe_Kouts not like I'll die allergic. Just I'll sneeze so much I wanna kill myself allergic. And I can get hives and rashes sometimes
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-08 05:44:26	@Chloe_Kouts did you know not throwing away your trash could endanger the world? http://t.co/pinrcZFG4X
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-08 02:57:55	@drvgfuII @audrey_imholt eww. He's playing football. Has he ever heard of FIFA?
2610233343	trrhyans	2015-06-08 03:05:22	@trevdep call your girl by her first name, she'll enjoy hearing her name come from your mouth😉
