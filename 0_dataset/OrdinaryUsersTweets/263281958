263281958	ChuckNewton9	2011-09-09 21:32:28	@Russostrib @mecb37 But a good one for the Wild and our new players. I can't wait to see how the Seto-Koivu-Heatley line will do.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2011-09-20 15:39:39	@1500ESPNJudd @1500ESPNPhunn @1500ESPN I love what Chuck has done with our team.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2011-09-21 18:04:16	@mnwild  I love listening to these interviews but I can't stop laughing because I always count how many " and a" there is when they talk.LOL
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2011-09-24 03:58:18	@Russostrib the most underated line this year will be Clutter-Brodz-Powe no question, It's going to be a fun year.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2011-10-03 01:04:51	@1500ESPNJudd   Offensive line might just be the worst in the NFL...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2011-09-27 21:33:52	@Russostrib What is your take on Brendan Shanahan's opening week as NHL sheriff? I like what he is doing and the video explanation.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2011-10-03 14:44:52	Everyone talks about the A.Luck sweepstakes. But they should be talking about O'Line sweepstakes. O'Line is AWFUL!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2011-10-04 05:14:36	@Dsetoguchi10 Hey Devin, Just want to say Good Luck this year and welcome to GODS country.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2011-12-08 04:23:44	@JJN1196  whats up
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2011-12-09 15:58:45	Brodziak major and ejection for hit on Kopitar was a brutal call
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2011-12-23 20:15:35	@NHLShanahan Don't matter, Hes in a vulnerable position without an attemp to slow or put his stick around him and ride him into the boards.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-02 17:54:17	@Russostrib is Seto on the ice still?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-09 15:31:16	@KFAN1003 Hey Russo you jinxed us with your missing of Vancouver with the new realignment. I think it stinks they are holding off.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-03 16:42:05	I hope Rick Spielman can do the job for the Vikings sake.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-03 16:59:08	Can't wait to get Seto back in the line-up tomorrow nite. Fingers crossed!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-03 17:22:48	@mnwild @houston_aeros wish he could stay and they would reassign Staubitz.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-03 18:55:44	http://t.co/uopuF0Vz I really hope the NHL on down changes the rules so you can't drive someone straight thru the numbers when u check.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-10 20:57:20	@TerriClarkMusic  I thought that was pretty normal to me. NOT=) Besides who watches Soap Opera's when they are working out anyways seriously
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-06 14:13:21	@TerriClarkMusic Are you coming to MN?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-12 17:21:39	@TerriClarkMusic Wait What????
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-07 19:13:27	@NHL The NHLPA can blow it out there you know what, This is a joke! Without the fans you would have nothing!!! This is a great way to losem
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-19 19:58:45	@TerriClarkMusic now that's funny =)

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-17 15:19:35	@TomPelissero @BradBiggs How many teams that run the Tampa 2 defense have made the playoffs recently?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-18 14:37:21	@TerriClarkMusic Agreed!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-23 22:52:52	@TerriClarkMusic Now that I found you #TerriClarkinCITYNAME
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-24 15:15:50	@WCCORosen @VikingsTD AGREED, I sure would. There is a reason MN  Gov't is the laughing stock of the country, One word " VENTURA".
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-24 20:40:40	The Vikings should leave,our politicians are idiots. Let's build it on the Metrodome site so we can go thru the same BS 30 years from now.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-01 21:19:24	@Russostrib so it was you who jinxed'em!!!! LOL
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-02 14:43:13	@TerriClarkMusic one of lifes many simple pleasures =)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-02 22:01:42	@blakeshelton What's Adam doin to Christina?  LOL
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-01-27 15:15:49	@TerriClarkMusic  The World needs a Drink
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-03 16:57:42	@Russostrib I like the move. I think EC could rejuvante his career here. Good Move.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-03 17:46:13	@Russostrib What does Yeo thinkk of the trade?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-03 19:06:57	@TerriClarkMusic Now that's climbing into bed.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-06 15:06:51	Is hoping the #mnwild make a strong run and make the playoffs.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-06 15:25:15	@Russostrib Excellent...He has really turned out to be a pleasant suprise this season.Shocked by the amount of games and how many blk shots.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-13 15:27:12	I think the Vikings should leave, Our MN Gov't is a joke. I sumtimes think I would be better off not to vote. It would save me the disaptmnt
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-07 19:49:35	@blakeshelton So what you are saying is, you were just run over by a locomotive and  watching a one legged duck swim in a circle. Ouch!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-08 16:45:29	@ElizabethBanks That is super cool.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-16 18:50:22	@TerriClarkMusic I grew up listening to M.R. haven't listened to him in a while. Thx his music will be stuck in my head the rest of the day
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-21 16:04:48	Will the @mnwild 
 be buyers or sellers at the trade deadline?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-10 18:31:49	The #mnwild need to make a trade. Just don't make another Leddy trade.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-10 18:37:31	Hopes that the #Wild will end up with @TuomoRuutu by the NHL trade deadline.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-23 22:17:14	@Russostrib This is the I am sorry we are not going to be able to upgade the team this year at the deadline move.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-26 18:44:20	@WCCORosen @Matt_Berg  Ive been saying that for years.Why do our pitchers always have arm problems since Gardy and Anderson took over?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-25 02:43:16	@Russostrib What a nice trade....I love what Fletcher is doing.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-28 14:58:28	@1500ESPNJudd @Phunnsie @1500ESPN   Because I think he will try to trade Backstrom in the off season and sign Harding.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-25 22:15:00	@1500ESPNJudd Great Move, Help now and for the future.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-02-29 21:36:55	@TerriClarkMusic This is why I listen to u, I love acoustical music like this feels more down home. What an AMAZING voice you have.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-01 16:58:54	@Russostrib Not sure what to think about this guy? He doesn't even resemble the guy that used to play hard and physical when he was in Pit.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-02 14:38:32	@Russostrib I sure hope he get's suspended. That was a total intent to injure a player who was already tied up by another. DIRTY PLAY!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-02 16:29:44	@Dsetoguchi10  The Canandians should be fined for not cleaning the ice very well.  I feel for ya Seto...Next time
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-05 15:38:17	@WCCORosen Whomever took part in such a thing should be kicked out of the league.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-06 15:37:32	Is hoping the #MNWILD can put a hurtin on the Avs tonite!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-07 15:44:43	I am looking forward to the MN Boys State H.S. Hockey Tournament Rocks. Should be a good tournament.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-09 01:21:59	@VikingsZap just  DIRTY!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-12 16:49:13	@NHL Take away the trapizoid,bring back the 2 line pass,no touch up offsides and no touch icings should take care of a lot off the problem
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-23 13:58:40	@1500ESPNJudd @Phunnsie @1500ESPN  Who r they going to get that's better than Tubby,
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-19 19:30:37	@DanBarreiroKFAN  I guess the move to L.A. won't be such a big thing after all. Not the way Speilman wanted to start his career as a GM.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-21 17:17:07	NFL suspends New Orleans Saints Coach Payton for one year without pay.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-21 17:40:00	@FrankCaliendo Saw you last night on Leno, you were awesome and the look on Ron Pauls face was hilarious...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-21 21:20:07	@1500ESPNJudd They were to busy trying to figure out which free agent fullback to sign first.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-23 21:01:44	@Russostrib What a JOKE! Someone should put Tanguay into next year. The system is a JOKE.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-30 16:50:56	@mnwild Because Hockey makes me happier.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-03-30 17:43:03	@johnkriesel It's like drinking if you don't want to drink, don't drink.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-05-01 20:00:25	@TomPelissero @dbrauer  NO ROOF!!!! NO SUPER BOWL!!!! NO NCAA FINAL FOUR!!!! NO MLS SOCCER!!!! NO EXTRA REVENUE!!!!!

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-05-08 21:20:03	DO NOT VOTE for Sen. Marty check!!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-05-14 13:54:43	@Russostrib The WILD really messed up when they let him go.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-05-14 16:41:00	@KFAN1003  #Twins I have never seen so many pitcher injuries. This didn't happen under Kelly and Such...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-05-15 16:36:35	@TwinsPrez @KenDavidoff  Would much rather have a World Series here  instead.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-05-24 21:24:37	@Russostrib @KFAN1003 Love it!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-05-25 16:13:40	@Russostrib @KFAN1003 Do you think that there will be a labor strife in the NHL next year? I am afraid if there is it might kill the NHL.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-14 20:31:08	@TerriClarkMusic Have you ever fished Lake of the Woods? It's a blast and so peaceful.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-15 14:31:53	If the #MNWILD can sign Parise and Suter, they become a instant contender,especially with the addition of Granlund and Croyle.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-13 15:07:31	@FSNGorg  I think that if you get Parise it will attract other FA's. It shows that they want to win and have a LOT of young talent coming up
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-13 15:09:11	@KFAN1003I think that if you get Parise it will attract other FA's. It shows that they want to win and have a LOT of young talent coming up
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-13 16:19:59	@mnwild I sure we can get Zach Parise. We need to become the new Detroit Red Wings of the NHL as we are the state of hockey.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-19 15:14:25	@fsnorth @MNWild @MNBrianHall Me too, but I am concerned that if the CBA in not ratified. There could be a big impact on the league.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-19 20:33:33	@TerriClarkMusic champagne dreams and caviar!!!! RUBE!!! =)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-19 21:18:57	I listen to this song every fathers day it's one of my favs. Seein' My Father In Me - Paul Overstreet: http://t.co/FutDvd4A via @youtube
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-22 15:20:27	@Russostrib is it possible that the Wild could end up with Ryan, Parise and Suter?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-27 13:59:09	@JennyMcCarthy are you hosting this show?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-27 18:21:20	@Russostrib I hope this stands true. It would be nice to see the season start on time.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-07-02 14:40:23	Hoping and Praying that the Wild can land Parise and Suter today. The Wild would be instant contenders with that roster.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-07-02 15:47:32	I would not want to be Craig Leipold or Chuck Fletcher if Parise doesn't sign with the WILD.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-07-02 19:27:43	Why does the signing of Zach Parise feel like I'm watching Brett Favre on the last play in new Orleans!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-07-03 01:19:22	@brianlawton9  MN w/great up and coming talent the WILD have and the peices that r already here they will make the WILD instant contenders.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-07-03 13:07:32	@Russostrib Dont like the fact that he stayed in Toronto.I really believed that had he of come to MN he was signing here. Now im not so sure
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-07-03 18:10:02	@Russostrib  Your gut still saying Pittsburgh?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-07-03 21:02:52	@kausatoday I bet sparks fly tomorrow over Suter and Parise...I just hope they are the good kind.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-07-04 04:03:47	@Russostrib This is a good sign I hope! Fingers Crossed.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-25 13:46:01	@PowerTripKFAN  Do you know which player got the 1st Hat Trick in Wild history? He might be in the room where you are right now.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-25 17:57:28	@Jason_Zucker16  I hope you all stop by the Hippodrome and Hall of Fame when you are there. One of my favorite hockey places ever.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-25 20:17:23	@NHLonNBCSports   MN WILD.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-25 20:28:22	@NHLonNBCSports I hope it is the GOOD kind. I think he would make the WILD a playoff contender instanly and attract other top UFA's.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-26 15:25:19	@Russostrib If for some reason the Wild dont get Parise, Is there a chance they make a run at Bobby Ryan?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-26 15:49:38	Thanks @Russostrib, Keep up the great work.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-06-26 17:44:42	@DanBarreiroKFAN  WHAWHA!!!!!

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-07-27 21:24:59	@TomPelissero  How does Ponder look?  I still say he is the KEY to the team.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-07-31 19:05:13	@1500ESPNJudd  Nope and until they go out and get a legit #1 Pitcher then I won't bother.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-09 21:25:52	@LauraSchara  Like you need make up =)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-06 14:33:34	@TomPelissero @JLBerry24 I would think if they were going to add a WR. It would happen after final roster movers for a veteran WR.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-13 21:07:20	@fsnorth @MNBrianHall  He is a better pass catcher then Kliensasser
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-15 20:05:50	@NHL   Gary Bettman made it clear the NHL fully understands the NHLPA's proposal. The owners just don't like too much about it.”
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-14 15:14:31	@reporterchris I hope they can figure this out. Cuz I don't think the NHL can afford another lock out. I don't think the FANS will come back
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-23 21:09:29	@mena13suvari I love Frankie Valli
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-20 17:25:03	@NHL@NHLPA I sure hope u can settle this CBA. Finally the sport is growing every year, now is not the time to have another  lock out.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-24 20:03:13	TGIF!!!!! Cheers and Enjoy

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-24 20:52:57	@JennyMcCarthy Ur such a great Mom. Evan is a lucky boy.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-23 16:09:58	@markhmasters POOR economy and the rich fifgting over Billions. If thats what Bettman thinks, it will take years for the FANS to come back.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-23 21:18:09	@mena13suvari R U a fan of the Everly Brothers?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-28 21:15:27	@brianlawton9 @NHL I bet if they went up to 51% it would start to move faster.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-28 21:56:10	@TaraReid  Sweet Dreams to you =)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-30 04:33:16	@JasonBiggs now that made my night.LOL
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-30 18:19:29	@Russostrib @reporterchris  I agree, I would bet that if the owners gave the players 50-51 %  instead of the 46-48% they would get it done.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-29 15:51:43	@mena13suvari I was thinking of this song http://t.co/dJWXW1cZ
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-08-31 13:45:02	@jenniegarth It's like dating you roll the dice sometimes you win some times you lose.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-12 02:53:51	@walsha What do you think is going to happen?

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-10 20:16:15	@ReplaceBettman @UnfollowNHLSept @NoHockeyLockout @NHL@NHLPA Funny,The owners want all this change Yet,They keep signingplayers. HMMM!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-12 19:42:45	@NHL @NHLPA @NoHockeyLockout At least they are talking.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-12 19:52:21	@Russostrib do we know what the league offered? I would like to see a 5yr deal min.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-12 20:10:26	@SteveCarell What store was that? LOL
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-12 20:41:51	@NHL @NHLPAThe NHL will suffer TREMENDOUSLY because of all of the NEGATIVITYandGREED! So much for the nice growth over the last seven years,
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-12 21:36:22	@blakeshelton @zacgrantham  Red Solo Cup I fill you up let's have a party!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-13 00:38:45	@NHLPA should go down &amp; @NHL up, HRR growth based on avg. over last 10 years, player share would drop from 55% to 54 to 53, 52, 51.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-13 02:43:44	@NHL @NHLPA @NoHockeyLockout  The ONLY ones that get hurt here are the FANS.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-06 19:31:17	@KateUpton Great Pic I like a da chicks!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-13 04:40:14	@NoHockeyLockout @walsha @nhl told you many of times it's ALL ABOUT POWER and GREED!only the fans suffer.I love this game.But NOT this much.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-11 16:26:08	@makeupbyjulie @JennyMcCarthy DAMN!!! LUCKY!!! JEALOUS!!!! That would be awesome never been to a BEARS game.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-11 17:49:22	@ESPN_NHL  GREED by both sides as far as I am concerned.  Billionaires vs Millionaires  BOO HOO! What about the FANS!!!  #NOHockeyLockout
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-11 19:09:44	@TaraReid The Paparazzi = Taliban. I hate them both. Kick their A$$ Tara. Wish I could help.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-11 19:21:57	@RealScarlettJoh Right on =)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-13 17:13:42	@NoHockeyLockout I guess it's time for the FANS to show the @NHL that we are united and we will stop supporting them. Speaking of $1Billion
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-13 17:23:00	@NHL I would rather watch College Hockey They don't have lock outs and the ticket prices are much much better.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-13 17:52:08	If I was a #NHL Player I would want Fehr negotiating for me. He does a great job. Owners need to meet in the middle.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-13 18:05:22	I can't imagine that all of the NHL owners are united.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-13 20:06:18	@NoHockeyLockout I like watching Bettman look uncomfortable.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-13 20:15:37	@Russostrib I have said all along that it ahould be 50%
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-14 02:51:23	@NHL This is B.S. what the GREEDY owners r doing to this game. I am official going to boycott the NHL. Where is the WHA when you need them.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-14 04:07:42	@ShaniaTwain Love your music. But what I love most is who you are as a person. Loyal, Friendly, Loving great human being. Live, Laugh, Love
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-14 04:22:37	@oliviawilde I love your work. Super Fun to watch.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-14 04:40:32	@blakeshelton @RaeLynnOfficial Dude she got way more yours then you did hers.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-14 04:58:47	@blakeshelton @RaeLynnOfficial Damn I like my bEer, shit yea

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-14 05:14:37	@mena13suvari I miss my JEEP CJ5 it was the best on nights like tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-14 13:32:05	@NHLwiki Said it all along GREEDY Owners.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-05 16:58:33	@jenniegarth looks like they take after their momma.  You should be proud. My oldest is a senior this year and it hit me dang I'm old. LOL
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-14 14:38:11	@NoHockeyLockout @NHL the NHLPA should bring HRR down to 51% and ask owners for Revenue sharing. If that dont work shame on the owners.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-14 15:14:10	@ESPN_NHL @NHL I think the owners are under estimating the FANS.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-14 16:29:39	@KFAN1003  There is NO Sport without the FANS...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-14 17:55:32	@Russostrib Couldn't agree with him more. Nice Job Russo keep up the great work.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-14 18:09:47	Cullen said Minnesota based NHLers will start a "glorified beer league without the beer" next week
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-14 19:54:41	@jenniegarth 77° in MN today. Great bonfire weather.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-14 21:03:51	@Gambo620  Profit Sharing is on the way.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-05 17:33:20	@NHL@NHLPA without the FANS you have NOTHING!!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-05 19:55:41	@NHLonNBCSports @JoeYerdonPHT   Billionaires vs Millionaires crying wolf when they avg Mid class person can't even afford to go to the games
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-14 21:16:05	@NHL @NHLPA  Can't fix stupid.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-06 14:18:50	@TSNBobMcKenzie  I just can't believe after the growth of the @NHL over the past 7 years the owners and @NHLPA can't figure this thing out.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-07 19:12:17	@SunGarrioch Still meeting is a good sign
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-08 05:16:54	@mena13suvari  I'm so jealous... DAMN!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-16 01:29:37	@NHL Nobody wants to play hockey more than I do(Gary Bettman). I call BULL SHIT.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-16 01:31:23	@Jeremy_Roenick  Couldn't agree more. This will be costly and will hurt the league for years to come.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-16 22:44:00	@JennyMcCarthy Darn right, lucky guy =)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-16 22:55:37	@NHL @NHLPA @ @NoHockeyLockout 
I am offilcially never spending another dime on anything that has to do with the NHL.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-16 23:04:32	@NHL in today's economy how can you be fighting over BILLIONS of dollars. You are cutting off the hand that feeds you. The FANS.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-17 14:40:21	@MaStrozyk The New Jersey Devils Owner started it all with the signing of kovalchuk. Then Philly signed Pronger. Don't Blame Leipold.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-17 17:06:56	@PhilRichards6  way to go VIKINGS!!!! Well done.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-18 01:08:52	@NoHockeyLockout I think it's time to send a message to the @NHL. The FANS are holding our own LOCKOUT against the NHL were not coming back.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-18 14:57:41	@walsha @Commish_Gary They are idiot's if that is what they think. They chose to shut it down not the players.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-18 17:29:14	The NFL lost one of its most influential figures and the world lost a great man. RIP, Steve Sabol.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-18 18:02:23	@ESPN_NHL  GOD HELP THEM!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-18 20:17:32	@Russostrib NHLPA told players today that NHL has instructed insurers to cancel all player insurance coverage effective Sept. 16, 2012. #NHL
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-19 13:23:59	@MinnesotaWildMN It's awfully nice that are offering 10% intrest on YOUR money. But I would send a message to the NHL and take my money back
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-19 13:30:27	@walsha @Real_ESPNLeBrun  They should be concerned. It's to close to the last lockout and without the FANS U have NOTHING. WAKE-UP  @NHL
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-19 15:31:37	@JasonBiggs now that would be quite the cat fight. I wonder if Amanda would be the man in the relationship.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-19 18:07:42	@MinnesotaWildMN  Love it!  The FANS need to send a message to the NHL
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-19 21:37:12	@Russostrib In all honesty the NHPLA needs to come down to 52% on the HRR the owners need to give into Revenue Sharing before this gets done
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-20 13:53:48	@jenniegarth WOW! what an amazing view.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-20 15:11:11	@gophersoccer  Why is there no MEN's Soccer Program?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-21 13:13:49	@jenniegarth  Absolutely to just clear the mind and or to be with someone who will just listen to you while you are.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-27 01:51:20	@MinnesotaWildMN  another reason to be ticked off at the NHL. They are killing all of the momentem that they once had.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-24 21:05:11	@ESPN_NHL  Where is the WHA when you need them. I support college hockey anyway. NO Lockouts There.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-20 06:21:18	@MinnesotaWildMN  Fans have put their HARD EARNED MONEY towards the Team with the 4th highest ticket prices in the NHL. They should bail.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-21 14:54:23	@Russostrib Love Bobby Orrs take on the lock out.Orr: “It would be outrageous not to have a season” http://t.co/VjRopHzo  via @HalfordPHT
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-27 19:20:08	@Russostrib Do you think that they might make progress this weekend?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-27 19:21:23	@WhoOwnTheChiefs  It's owns, owns da cheifs. Love that line.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-22 00:02:37	@NHL @NHLPA @NoHockeyLockout when the league comes back the fans should walk away for as many days the lockout last. create lost revenue
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-22 00:10:22	@TheRealXtina MY OH MY =&gt;
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-27 20:47:07	I love it. What a great picture of Aaron Rodgers after the Seahawks game. http://t.co/sV6aq5MI
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-28 14:30:35	@NoHockeyLockout  Let's hope they make progress this weekend.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-28 14:39:37	@NHL Get it done this weekend...PLEASE for the LOVE OF GOD!!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-28 15:54:40	@jrodfromoz TGIF! Here is what's on my mind, Margadaquiriscrewalottaonthebeach Hey,Hey.....
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-25 14:11:23	@ESPN_NHL I guess that's 10 Games I will NOT be atttending when they come back.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-22 05:09:23	@Russostrib why did the Boogaard family go after NHLPA and not the NHL?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-02 13:39:48	@ESPN_NHL  17 Days of the Lockout. Means this is how many games I will not attend nor purchase any merchandise affilated the @NHL
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-02 18:46:16	@walsha KHL can be a dangerous player in all of this.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-02 19:59:40	@NHL @NHLPA !!!!!  QUIT taking ADVANTAGE of the FANS!!! Get IT DONE!!!We the FANS DO NOT deserve THIS crap.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-25 16:41:27	@Russostrib That's good to see let's hope we get to see him play this year.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-25 16:55:56	@TSNBobMcKenzie  Let's hope they can pull there head's out of you know where and get the ball rolling.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-25 18:56:15	@DarrenDreger If they are smart and had any COMMON SENSE at all, they would sit down and figure this CBA thing out.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-25 19:09:32	@Russostrib I heard there was going to be a meeting this week.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-25 19:16:54	@SportsCenter ALL Green Bay Packer Fans =) LOL
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-28 19:59:53	@ESPN_NHL This is awesome!!! Maybe the NHL will realize that they now have competition and need to get this done.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-28 21:23:44	@KateUpton Hey Kate, I wonder if there is a way to Dougie Amish Style....LOL
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-09-26 05:36:54	@TSNBobMcKenzie  This league was on the rise but will take a huge step back. Franchises will be lost over this lockout!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-03 15:42:28	In today's economy the @NHL and @NHLPA should be ashamed of themselves.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-03 16:20:54	@MarneyGellner @KFAN1003  I thought you wrote Brow on LOL!!! Sorry PA
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-04 14:04:53	@NHL the more I look at this the more I am for the players. Who continues to ask for 24% reduction in wages 2 CBA's in a row. NOBODY
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-04 17:20:30	@DarrenDreger Not Postponed like Daly said?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-04 18:10:50	@NHL Blame the Dumb owners on this one. What employee would take a 24% salary reduction 2x in a row.Especially after the last lockout.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-04 19:40:05	@NoHockeyLockout Let see if we can get as many people as possible to unfollow the @NHL and send them a message we mean buisness.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-10 17:54:28	@NHL @NHLPA I blame the Ownership. PLEASE STOP THE GREED!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-10 18:07:15	@NHL @NHLPA Bettman says it's 50/50 on who the FANS blame for the Lockout Let's see what the FANS say to that. Who do you blame?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-10 20:23:10	@NHL  @NHLPA @NoHockeyLockout  Nothing like using public money to fund arenas. Then you lockout the FANS. This is B.S. and you know it.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-10 20:31:22	@Russostrib  Coleman should tell the NHL that they can pick up the publics share of the financing of the arena until they ratify the CBA.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-11 14:21:40	@FrankCaliendo Man what I wouldn't give to watch you impersonate Gary Bettman,Bill Daly, Don Fehr, Steve Fehr over the NHL Lockout.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-11 15:36:43	@walsha How about all of the local business owners around or near the arena that are suffering. I can't imagine how they must feel.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-11 16:53:10	@walsha  FUNNY! Bettman's way of reducing ticket prices was by not raising them. They weren't reduced, they just didn't go up.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-11 17:03:39	@walsha  WOW!!!!  Thanks
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-11 17:20:50	@walsha I would think that there would be a lot of animosity between owners right now.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-09 20:31:17	@walsha @CNL77 Greedy Basrtards are wrecking the start of my winter.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-10 16:43:01	@NoHockeyLockout @walsha Who would continue to take it in the rear and act like it is ok. Seriously the owners are clueless.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-11 00:08:35	@walsha @KatieStrangESPN  wasn't $300 million that they were looking to recover? funny they almost have made it.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-11 19:09:39	@walsha @what_the_puck1  which is why there is no way in hell all the owners are united in this lockout.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-12 15:47:52	@Russostrib Do you see Brodin making the team once the season gets going?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-05 19:10:07	@Real_ESPNLeBrun Let's hope the Owners came to their senses.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-05 19:29:55	@Real_ESPNLeBrun  The more they meet the better it will be.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-12 19:48:17	@NHL  Owners. Who is going to be the whistle blower and stand up for your FANS and get this thing settled.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-12 20:03:20	@walsha The players did the right thing in hiring him.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-11 19:00:52	Needed a laugh  during thisl lockout Slap Shot (1/10) Movie CLIP - The Finer Points of Hockey (1977) HD: http://t.co/LkM28sLy via @youtube
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-12 15:54:28	@Russostrib Do you think that they will go with 6 or 7  "D"  and who do you think it will be?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-15 19:37:25	In NHL lockout, owners hold key to ending, or not ending, labor battle - http://t.co/T82gtlIF http://t.co/uXjSGfUp via @newyorkpost
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-15 20:49:45	@Russostrib Right on Mike.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-16 16:47:13	@Real_ESPNLeBrun  with revenue sharing I hope
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-16 16:54:28	@Real_ESPNLeBrun  What's your gut say do the players take it?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-16 18:12:43	@Russostrib Let's hope the owners didn't try to sneak anything past the NHLPA  and we can gat on with this season. Mike as always great job.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-16 19:40:57	@Russostrib Well do you think the NHLPA will accept it?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-16 21:24:00	@Real_ESPNLeBrun  what is the word from the players?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-09 14:08:50	@MinnesotaWildMN  I think the FANS are starting to give up on the NHL.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-09 14:48:28	@walsha @Kevin_LeGrand I bet after this Lockout Bettman will be fired. You know darn well not all owners are on board with this Lockout.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-09 15:16:28	@NHL Good Luck with your Greediness, I will NEVER spend another dollar on you. Nice Job Bettman I would rather watch College Hockey no greed
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-17 18:24:00	@walsha  Oh wait a place to work, Oh yea they already have that with the KHL.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-17 20:33:22	@walsha The players want what's fair, but the owners are to darn greedy. They are chasing the fans away.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-17 21:05:31	@TSN_News I agree with the players. But I think it was riight move by the owners to jump start this deal. As fan not sure I want to comebak.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-19 06:30:19	@walsha They should have taken the 50/50 split and honored the contracts that they hurried to sign after FA started. I blame greedy owners.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-19 06:32:31	@NHL @NHLPA To all season ticket holders please start cancelling your season tickets if you want this madness to end.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-19 14:05:58	@bcostellothn  PA offered owners 50/50 split as long as current contracts were honored. How is this unfair exactly?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-19 14:07:55	NHLPA offered owners 50/50 split as long as current contracts were honored. How is this unfair?  Great offer by the PA.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-19 14:16:23	@DougMaclean PA offered owners 50/50 split as long as current contracts were honored. How is this unfair? Greedy Owners
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-19 15:04:21	@Real_ESPNLeBrun  except the owners of course
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-09 17:31:43	@walsha I AGREE, Love it.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-09 18:10:45	@Russostrib So much skill but just doesn't know how to use it.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-18 15:08:24	@brianlawton9 @NHL @NHLPA  couldn't agree more. The owners still have to budge a little and the players need to stay with the 50/50 HRR
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-18 15:30:39	@brianlawton9 @NHLPA  They need to honor the all current contracts with no rollback. They are the ones that paid them.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-18 15:46:52	@DarrenDreger I don't blame the players one bit. Good move by the owners though. Stll need to honor all current contracts.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-18 16:15:41	@TSNBobMcKenzie If season is lost this sport will never recover.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-18 16:25:59	@TSNBobMcKenzie Foolish and Ugly lol
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-19 16:18:30	@KFAN1003 NHLPA offered owners 50/50 split as long as current contracts were honored. How is this fair exactly?  The owners created this..
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-19 16:29:57	@walsha The only way to make a dent in the armour that Bettman thinks he has,is for season ticket holders to start cancelliing their tickets
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-19 17:32:04	@NHL set to announce cancellation of games through Nov. 1,  We the FANS do not CARE anymore.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-19 17:40:46	@walsha @NHL Owner: Let me give u a raise for your hard work. Employee: Thank You Owner: I overpaid u I want my money back. WTF!!! Really
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-19 18:36:19	@walsha AMEN been saying that all day and to try and get the FANS off there back a some against the @NHLPA. Not gonna work.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-22 16:02:03	@walsha Can't beleive the owners didn't accept that offer. Great offer by the PA
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-22 20:22:17	@NHLPA @kuklaskorner Big Mistake by the owners
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-22 21:11:09	@FrankViola16  Agreed.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-23 14:11:55	@NHL I am really disappointed that you didn't accept the @NHLPA 50/50 offer and honor the contracts of the players YOU signed. SHAME on YOU!

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-25 14:23:03	@NHL the only one you are hurting is the FANS. So go ahead with your billion dollar buisness and take a crap on FANS. Bettman YOUR WRONG.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-24 14:10:28	@NHL  @NHLFANS Please start cancelling your season tickets or this will never get done To Sponsors that support the NHL plz stop
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-24 14:13:30	@NHL @NoHockeyLockout. I have the NFL, MLB, NBA WCHA, KHL and Nascar. We the FANS can find another sport to watch. We don't need you!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-24 16:07:54	@Real_ESPNLeBrun  are you sure you want to put yourself through this...LOL
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-24 16:08:43	@strombone1 Now that's AWESOME
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-24 17:01:53	@walsha So the owners drive the prices up on each other when trying to sign a UFA, How is this the players fault? Yet don't want to honor it
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-25 21:24:50	@NHL @NoHockeyLockout  I really hope the Hockeys Fans send a message to the league and don't show up to the first 40 days of the season.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-25 21:48:13	@walsha please send him back to the NBA PLEASE!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-24 17:52:34	@KatieStrangESPN You want reality Bettman!  Your losing all of your FANS to other sports.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-24 17:53:49	@NoHockeyLockout #CBA Bettman on lockout: "Unfortunately, 82-game season does not seem to be a reality."
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-24 17:57:23	@Real_ESPNLeBrun  Here is what is most laughable. Yet the owners are the ones driving up the prices on each other when it comes the UFAs.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-24 20:05:13	@NHL @NHLPA @NoHockeyLockout  We need to lock the Don/ Steve Fehr in a room with Gary Bettman/Bill Daly and not feed them until we a new CBA
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-26 03:02:05	@NHL I will NEVER EVER EVER buy another NHL anything,
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-26 03:04:52	@ESPN_NHL Who Cares anymore.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-26 14:06:11	@walsha Absolutely Correct Allan,I have a lot of friends in MN that have said they are going to cancel their season tickets because of Ownrs
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-26 14:07:56	@walsha @Rupper17 @DarrenDreger Greedy Owners are to blame this time around. Players can only cave so much.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-26 14:41:40	@Russostrib  Here come the cancelled season tickets.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-26 14:44:03	@NHL offically a college hockey fan only. There are no GREEDY Owners in college hockey. Good Luck with your lockout.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-26 17:21:09	@Russostrib I couldn't agree more. Salary Cap will be coming off the table now. Look out this going to get much worse before it get's better
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-26 17:59:52	@Russostrib Season ticket holders are really getting their money's worth.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-26 19:46:16	@NHL @Jeremy_Roenick 
 Can the state tax payers that voted to build you an arena get their money back since you are not using the arena!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-26 20:30:37	@ESPN_NHL Not when the FANS don't come back it won't.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-31 15:26:24	@DarrenDreger @walsha  PA is not questioning the PA Leadership at all, This is why they hired Fehr. They didnt want to take in shorts again.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-31 19:45:09	@THNRoryBoylen Go KHL!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-01 14:01:04	@walsha who are the gang of 4 owners?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-01 14:07:49	@1500ESPNJudd An NHL owner speaks out: Sens' Melnyk: We should be playing hockey - sportsnet.ca http://t.co/RI4vJyPS …

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-18 17:24:04	@Real_ESPNLeBrun  Let's see if they even get to the table.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-18 17:43:09	@aaronward_nhl  I hope that is true otherwise they can lock the doors.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-30 04:40:43	@LauraSchara @chuckwicksmusic You will kick his butt.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-01 16:59:12	@NHLPA Is it true that you offered a 50/50 split through the length of the conctract as long as they owners honor the current contracts.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-01 17:27:17	@aaronward_nhl Unfortunately  Bettman has played the wrong Card. It's going to take a REALLY LONG, time to get the fans back if at all.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-01 19:24:49	Congrats to Mikael Granlund of the Houston_Aeros, today named the ahl Rookie of the Month for October: http://t.co/jorKhu5u
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-06 17:54:16	@walsha is it possible if they settle in the next few days that the Winter Classic could still happen?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-06 19:22:58	@canusaSD  Let's hope that progress has been made. I believe that if the owners honor contracts that it could get done in the next week.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-06 21:27:26	@sirobbins I voted to end the NHL Lockout.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-05 04:13:54	@ESPN_NHL Game has already been destroyed the NHL has NO idea  the damage to the FANS they have done. Bettman thinks were will coming back.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-05 14:42:03	@KFAN1003 Bill Musgrave needs to go. What has he proved as an NFL  O.C. ? Nothing!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-05 15:37:39	@KFAN1003  They Miss Sage Rosenfels, just like I said when they cut him. Veteren Presence needed.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-07 14:48:08	Let's hope that the 7hrs of meeting yesterday doesn't go to waste today.  #NHL #CBA
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-07 15:29:19	@JSportsnet Let's just hope the 7 hrs yesterday don't go to waste and they can still move forward. Maybe still have Winter Classic?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-07 15:51:36	Vikings need to take a look at Bill Musgrave as a OC, great QB coach not a very good OC in the NFL. He has proved nothing.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-07 16:45:36	@walsha @nationalpost No pun intended but they need to reach across party lines and compromise.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-07 18:17:51	@Real_ESPNLeBrun Owners just need to honor the contracts and this will be a done deal.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-07 18:19:18	@walsha @nationalpost AMEN!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-06 01:57:20	@johnkriesel hey John tell them to go ______ themsleves, does that make them one. LOL
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-02 14:00:22	anyone who would continue to be a @NHL fan at this point is an idiot. I hope FANS all cancel there season tickets and send a message.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-02 14:44:31	Rumors barring any  last minute change of heart by top league officials, It is expected that the Winter Classic will be cancelled today.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-02 15:23:41	@walsha @CLavallee I agree with u. The owners are destroying the league. W/@NHPLA offer of 50/50 split and contracts honored is a fair deal.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-02 15:49:22	@MinnesotaWildMN Nice Try Craig. U should be ashamed, Players come down to 50/50 split and want  u to honor the contract that you signed 2
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-02 15:53:49	Nice Job @NHL way to go and tell your FANS and sponsors to go F#&amp;% themselves we don't care about U. We DON'T NEED U!!!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-02 16:38:49	@ESPN_NHL May as well cancel the league and start a new WHA. The NHL needs some competition and the publicly owned buildings need to be used
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-02 17:15:39	@JSportsnet The @NHL should just fold the league or file bankruptcy since they only have a $3.3 billion dollar profit problem
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-02 17:15:45	The @NHL should just fold the league or file bankruptcy since they only have a $3.3 billion dollar profit problem
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-07 20:55:51	@brianlawton9 @NHLPA @NHL  do you think an Winter Classic could be back on?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-02 19:57:21	@walsha Yea Right!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-02 19:58:07	@walsha Fehr will go after the Cap. You know it's coming.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-02 20:01:48	@NHLbiz  @NHL BAD decision by the NHL. The players are going to come after the cap now. The owrers should have honred the contracts 50/50
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-02 20:14:58	@NHL all I keep hearing is that you are sorry for the FANS. Well what are you going to do to keep me a FAN. Not seeing anything on your part
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-03 02:43:14	@Russostrib @TomGazzola all the frustration is starting to settle in. Owners was it worth it? Here we go just what the Wild didn't need.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-08 18:08:11	@Real_ESPNLeBrun Hopefully they don't foul it up. C'MON  Hockey Gods..
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-08 18:33:47	@DarrenDreger C'MON Owners! Let's get this thing done.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-08 18:47:32	@ChrisBottaNHL ABSOLUTELY!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-08 20:48:51	@myNHLTradeRumor Players need to be at a straight 50/50 from the start to the ed of the CBA. Owners need to honor contracts.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-08 21:22:11	@TSNBobMcKenzie If the PA is not at 50/50 and the owners do not make whole then you can kiss the season goodbye.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-08 21:24:18	@mirtle  Florida should relocate to Seattle anyway one problem solved.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-08 21:26:46	@EricOnSportsLaw @yahoomac couldn't agree more
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-10-31 14:09:44	@walsha YES,YES,YES... I hope they do.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-09 16:31:57	@NHL &amp; @NHLPA  You are digging your own grave.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-14 17:23:52	@DarrenDreger @jamalmayers The NHL said NO to that already.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-14 21:43:08	@NoHockeyLockout I wouldn't give the owners the satisfaction as all they see are $ signs.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-12 03:16:51	@SportsCenter @ChicagoBears  There will be a fine for the hit that caused it. Should have been a helmet to helmet hit.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-12 14:22:50	@NHL Owners You should just fold the league. It's a take it or leave it offer from the soon to be EX-FANS!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-15 17:51:03	@NHL The damage of this Lockout will be permanent this time around. Season Tix holders and Sponsors will not becoming back,To many to soon.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-19 16:25:34	@krider1010 Now that sounds like a lot of fun, BooYa.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-16 15:01:34	@NHL  you are drowning your league in a pool of ice. U have no idea the long term permanent damage u have done. But you will soon find out
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-16 16:58:12	@walsha Why have so many people forgotten what Bettman said last lockout.He is such a hypocrite, I have been arguing this since lock started
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-19 21:08:44	@michaelgrange Actually yes they have.  But I don't want to stir the pot.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-12 20:34:47	@TSN_News @ NHL , Owners already destroyed the game. Players have made one concession after another. Now it's your turn to "Make Whole"
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-13 15:47:12	@KFAN1003 That's why I thought they should have had a veteren QB on the sidelines.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-13 18:27:09	@NHLbiz @ChecktheTicker  Bettman only has Ice in his veins. That guy doesn't have a soul!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-21 15:57:16	@mirtle @Russostrib  How much $ do the Billionaire Owners need? I mean c'mon already.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-21 16:06:23	@mirtle Gary Bettman is a "LIAR" and is taking advantage of the FANS, Look at what he said during that last lockout and tell me his not.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-21 16:39:05	@Russostrib What will be the excuse next time? We had to do to control ticket prices. Then proceed to raise them by 39% over the next 5 yrs.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-21 19:20:19	@brianlawton9 worth negotiating
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-21 20:05:31	@brianlawton9 Besides taking $ from the PA. What are the owners doing to help the other weak franchise owners with revenue?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-21 20:22:20	@NHL is this ur way of telling the FANS that you are doing this to control ticket prices again and then proceed to raise them 39%. U BLOW!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-21 20:56:45	@NHL I will do everything in my power to make sure you lose fans. Way to sign players not in good faith. You said you fixed this last time.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-21 21:26:27	@JoshYohe_Trib  you wanns fix the problem then contraction is the way to go.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-21 21:28:42	@michaelgrange That was your choice Bettman, You should have worked this out during the season.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-19 21:57:36	@walsha How's that working for them? Great deal Huh!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-20 02:01:29	@DarrenDreger That wasn't a very long meeting.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-20 02:09:05	@PaulCharchian He looks good, sure knows when to step up in the pocket and let'er go.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-20 02:50:57	@CraigJButton  Thank you Craig, I have been saying this since the Lockout started.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-20 22:14:04	@NHL I sure hope the FANS make Bettman feel stupid once this is settled. By not going to the games, which he says the fans will come back.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-26 22:32:47	@fsnorth @MNBrianHall  what about the hit on Rudolph? I thought that hit was an intent to injure and it worked.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-27 20:31:09	@Russostrib I hope that's not a sign
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-28 14:36:32	@MinnesotaWildMN They should brace for a lot more then that. This league is going down like the Titanic.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-28 14:38:54	@NHL Capsules: Wild staff brace for 20 percent pay cuts http://t.co/oQ9rRlv1   This league is going down like the Titanic.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-25 20:47:48	@johnkriesel @JeMiHamilton @cponder7 C'mon really! Bill Musgrave should resign or be fired.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-28 21:31:44	@VikingUpdate @APkrawczynski  I think that's crap. What aboout the cheap shot that Rudolph took that knocked him out of the game. Same hit.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-23 03:43:32	@AdrianPeterson Good Luck on Sunday go get them Bears.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-29 18:02:26	@TomPelissero Hey Tom, Why was the blind sided hit on Rudolph by the Bears LB any different then the hit Allen made. I don't see the diff...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-29 18:09:00	@TomPelissero I hear ya, My point being still a lot of room for rule changes in the NFL if they truly care about the health of player safety
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-29 20:24:07	@PaulCharchian Green or Starks
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-29 21:31:57	@Real_ESPNLeBrun  Big Suprise Right! "NOT"
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-29 22:11:36	Dear Owners of the @NHL, I have been life long fan sine the 70's. I have no time for a SPORT that has NO TIME for it's FANS!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-29 22:47:16	I'm a was a FAN of the @NHL. Who cares about me?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-29 22:53:40	@Proteautype I can't imagine how Suter and Parise must feel after all of this B.S. !
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-26 16:52:54	@SunGarrioch Sorry Mr. Daly, but you and the billoinaire owners have permanently damaged the game. Good luck getting it back.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-26 18:36:18	@TomPelissero  Musgrave has a terrible resume as a OC! end of story sometimes you should just stick with what you are good at QB coach.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-26 16:05:29	@NHL It's sad to see the GREED of the owners. The game will never be the same as it has been permanently damaged. Thought is was fixed 04-05
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-22 13:21:19	@SportsnetSpec neither are the owners. The game has been permanently damaged. It is going to take years to get it back if at all.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-22 13:40:55	Happy Thanksgiving to all except Gary Bettman and the owners.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-30 14:50:59	@simmonssteve how about honoring a contract that the owner signed and offered to you. I highly doubt you would just take it up the ying yang
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-30 15:04:28	@jessespector I think all the cities that've used  tax $ to help fund the arena's should start asking for their money back from the owners.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-30 16:08:38	@Proteautype Let's put the owners  in front of ALL their season ticket holders and ahave a Q&amp;A. Let;s see how that flies?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-30 16:13:59	@NHL @NoHockeyLockout Let's put the owners in front of ALL their season ticket holders and a have a Q&amp;A. Let's see how that flies?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-30 16:21:38	@JSportsnet The rich keep getting richer. While the poor keep getting poor. Sounds awfully familiar.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-27 14:47:46	@HockeyyInsiderr They  may as well file bankruptcy too. From what I here and see in the social media. They NHL is not winning over the FANS.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-27 21:33:31	@ESPN_NHL The NHL will suffer for years to come. This lockout was way to close to 04-05 lockout. FANS are furious!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-27 21:36:27	@ESPN_NHL hard to put faith in a league that doesn't care about it's fans.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-27 21:39:34	@NHL Gary Bettman/Owners where does the feelings of the fans come into play w/lockout. When you need a new arena built or a practice (1)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-27 21:42:12	@NHL facility or some arena imrpovements the people are there for you. Where are you for the FANS right now Mr.Bettman/Owners. (2)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-27 21:44:49	@NHL you do not know how to negotiate. You said this was fixed after the 04-05 season. Well thank you for making me choose a different sport
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-28 14:27:51	@Proteautype Couldn't agree more! Been saying that since they locked us out. And yes I mean the FANS cuz this is who they truly lockedout.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-28 19:24:08	@TomPelissero Time for Musgrave to go...He is still an unproven OC. Should've stayed a QB coach.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-28 21:59:54	@ChrisWasselTHW  when you shut the fans out of your equation. We really don't give a rip about there headache.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-30 19:08:21	@SBJLizMullen  Let's put the owners in front of ALL their season ticket holders and see how that goes....
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-11-30 22:06:36	@HouseManChad @TwinsPrez  Now go and get Zack Greinke PLEASE!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-03 15:55:52	@StribDW I agree, but with this coaching staff it wasn't the right chance. Frazier &amp; Musgrave have never done anything to prove they can win
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-04 20:15:45	@StribDW Bummer "NOT"
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-04 20:40:02	BREAKING - Bret Bielema will be the new head coach at Arkansas; not known if he'll coach Wisconsin in Rose Bowl.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-05 15:54:27	@dstaples How many fans voted?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-06 15:13:40	@scottcarefoot Depends on what concessions the owners are taking in order to make it a 10 yr.deal.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-06 18:17:26	Player sources say they're determined to continue to negotiate for what's right. But there will be a deal and a season.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-06 18:22:22	the #NHL &amp; #NHLPA have now tentatively agreed to meet this afternoon.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-06 20:00:53	@adater Not at all,  the owners still want everything. They have not conceeded anything in this CBA. Don Fehrs job was to help and he is.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-06 21:38:57	@NHLOwners But you are not honoring what you have signed me too...You said in 04-05 that you fixed all of this now you want more? HMMM!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-06 21:57:26	@ChrisBottaNHL It's obvious the PA can't think for itself right now. I think this shows a split in the union.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-05 17:14:38	@aaronward_nhl  as a former player what are your thoughts on that ?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-05 17:33:03	Per: Nick Kypreos an NHL Insider says Bettman wants this deal done by Friday...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-05 17:42:52	@dstaples sad part is he crippled the league. I personally think he a long recovery ahead of him. I bet contraction will be in the future.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-05 17:58:50	@StribDW Rumor has it that if Musgrave is still the OC next year Percy is a a goner.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-03 14:31:56	@PaulCharchian  Loved ur take on the Purple this morning. I am with you. The Coaching staff has to go.  I'll judger Ponder under new regime.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-05 21:59:16	@drosennhl  What's ur gut say Dan?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-07 07:17:43	@sn_nhl  If you blame Fehr you are a idiot. Bettman locked out the Fans in 04-05 and told the people it had to happen to fix the economics
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-07 07:21:42	@NHL we need fix help the struggling franchises by taking money from the players WOW what a great concept. The NHL owners are laughing@Fans
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-07 07:26:14	@NHL The FANS don't mean anything to the NHL. All they want is ur $. Sponsors should jump ship. Wish I had 3.3 billion $ problem.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-07 07:26:47	@Dustinpenner25  AMEN!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-07 07:30:36	@abdulmajidAH @Dustinpenner25  who screwed up? Fehr is protecting the players. Have you ever been a part of a union? U have no idea?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-07 07:38:12	@DobberHockey Wow great take, only 1 problem, this was supposed to be fixed in 04-05 remember so this wouldn't happen again. NHL Lied!!!!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-06 15:36:56	@TGfireandice  because players are the ones giving the concessions. When is the last time an owner had a concussion. Jacobs needs one!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-06 17:26:03	@iMinnesotaSport  Signing #1 Starting Pitcher  will drive Ticket Sales. Not social media.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-06 19:24:13	@KFAN1003  Really bummed the Superstar is not with you anymore. Time to find a new station in the morning. BYE KFAN! It was fun.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-07 14:20:24	@ChrisRBarron No they weren't,  They  believe in Don Fehr.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-07 14:24:57	@MNState0fHockey You are wrong, not the case at all. He is protecting his constituents. All the owners keep doing is moving money around.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-03 18:51:22	@TomPelissero  he should be fired for that alone
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-07 00:54:06	@NHL @NHLPA  I will never be back as a FAN, I am sad to let go but enough is enough. The Owners/ Players are to blame. Not a good buisness.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-07 00:55:43	@drosennhl  should have never locked out the fans then.  The game will be damaged forever.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-04 16:55:01	@walsha This is about being STUPID and GREED! Who pays to come see the games? Who pays for the merchandise? Who is not being thought of?

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-06 16:31:41	Bettman and Jacobs have crippled the @NHL!  Don't think it will ever be the same.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-06 16:50:55	As promised, I will now miss a full 82 game season. As I said for every day the lockout goes I would miss that many games and here we r #82.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-06 21:00:14	@NHLOwners What concessions have you made to the PA?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-06 22:23:49	@NHLOwners  somebody has to protect the players. Just like Bettman and the Owners.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-06 22:52:15	@NHLPA Get It Done! Get It Done! Get It Done! Get It Done! Get It Done! Get It Done!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-07 14:22:26	@MinnesotaWildMN He should be working on the CBA instead.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-13 19:03:58	@KellyWong19 @NHLOwners  The Owners created this problem.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-13 20:59:46	@PsychoPuckLady  He should be tweeting the owners not the players. The Owners are the ones that locked him out. Gotta Love It!

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-10 15:59:05	@ChrisBottaNHL @DarrenDreger  The NHL is OVER! It's OFFICIALLY DEAD!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-14 23:16:16	@NHLOwners @NHLPA  Not players fault you don't know how to run a buisness. Good Luck getting a tax payer to help support getting new arenas
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-12 17:37:18	@JSportsnet The way it should be.  Now we just need some common sense.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-12 18:22:43	@BabesDigBalls Yes, Games will be played on New Years a 50 or 48 game season.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-12 18:47:43	@anderson19_jill  Why is Fehr to blame? Bettman told us this wouldn't happen again last time they Lockedout the FANS.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-12 19:24:08	@miss_deyo  I hope it all goes well. My Buddy just gave his sister one his kidney's.  Best of Luck!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-12 19:26:06	C'MON  Owners/Players let's get this DONE!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-12 22:17:26	Bettman/Owners = Richards
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-12 23:02:08	I am beginning to think that the big owners are hoping to lose the season on purpose. This way they can use damage to contract.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-13 00:49:28	@NHLOwners The FANS are going to be the ones who cave. I bet that there will be a lot of empty arena's when this is over.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-13 01:25:45	@NHLOwners I think your owner is the "BITCH" according to Jacobs. HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! Small time in Winnepeg!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-16 01:16:15	@NHL U can take your ur league and shove it.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-17 03:37:44	Let's see how long the @NHL  can last without the FANS!!! Who is joining me enough already!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-17 04:45:21	@Russostrib How bout Kapernick. Is it coaching or is he just better then Ponder?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-17 03:33:12	@HockeyyInsiderr  Let's see how long the NHL can last without the FANS!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-17 03:53:27	@AdamSchefter He is a machine, plain and simple.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-17 18:17:58	@NHLOwners Dont care about your BILLION DOLLAR PROFIT problem. Put your $ where the sun don't shine, as u hold the FANS hostage!  BOYCOTT!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-17 18:38:01	@NHLOwners Right now you don't have a demoraphic!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-18 19:47:55	@Nick_Prospero @HockeyCanada There's water in coffee.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-18 14:39:40	@EricOnSportsLaw That's why the owner's need better revenue sharing. I have said all along that this is a way for them to contract teams.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-18 14:41:19	@FrankViola16 Love that show.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-18 14:51:15	The people I feel bad for are the employee's and bar/resturaunt owners that are struggling because of this @NHL LOCKOUT. It's not the League
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-18 15:04:40	@myNHLTradeRumor I can't believe that some of the MAJOR Sponsors are still hanging around. No good Advertisement with the lockout.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-18 15:16:54	@myNHLTradeRumor  I agree to an extent.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-18 20:46:53	@NHLOwners @Real_ESPNLeBrun  Now that's funny =)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-18 18:09:12	@MinnesotaWildMN  They can't /won't explain it, They NEVER intended to pay them in the first place.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-20 19:22:52	@walsha  it is a take it or leave it offer &amp; unless the players accept there offer there is no reason to meet. Where is the give by the NHL?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-19 17:48:29	@SNHockeyCentral as they should why does it have to be a take it or leave it thing. Daly danced around the? when asked what's in it for PA.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-19 18:01:12	@NHLPA @NHL in interview w/ SN 590  gotta LOVE the way Daly danced around the question of what is better in this CBA than the last one. (1)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-19 18:09:30	@NHLPA @NHL  then when McLean asked him about losing the season because of 3 Key issues Daly basicallly said it is a take it or leave it.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-19 20:33:48	Great piece in Time Magazine that illustrates what's really at the heart of the NHL lockout &amp; why it wont be solved http://t.co/iJg7Bxoy …
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-19 21:05:23	Watch Mr.Daly dance in  full interview from today. #NHL may need to cancel more games before Christmas. Watch: Great http://t.co/3FZgZgFQ …
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-19 21:40:02	@miss_deyo AMEN to that, One of my very good friends gave his to his sister  a few years ago and that was a very tough recovery. Stay Strong
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-18 20:47:50	@AmeliaRayno Absolutely NOT! It's my favorite.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-18 20:52:28	@candacecbure Prayers sent.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-19 18:11:19	@SNHockeyCentral He needs to show me what is better from the prior CBA cause I don't see a thing.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-21 17:50:03	@TheFanOnStrike I was a loyal fan, I've had enough of the lockouts. I will not spend a dime on the @NHL for @least a couple years.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-20 19:24:42	@walsha  tis the giving season and the only ones I see giving is the players. Is there anything better for the players in this CBA?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-22 05:03:18	If @NHLOwners  think the government is on your side you are sadly mistaken as gov't authorities are ripping NHL for mis-management.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-25 16:37:00	I don't want to be the Grinch, Lockout has now become of who can puff out there chest the farthest, Fehr or the Owners. No CBA any time soon
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2012-12-25 18:23:42	@cponder7 same to you and your family. Nice game this past week.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-03 14:53:27	Happy Trails to Team Canada after being spanked by Team USA last night 5-1. Our boys will be playing for the GOLD! Nice Job Boys.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-03 16:40:47	@JulieRobenhymer @jenny_leeann The North Dakota Fighting Who...LOL.. Honeslty Ralph Engelstad is turning in his grave right now.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-01 22:33:51	Let's start off the new year with an NHL season!!! @Git'er Done
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-03 17:55:56	NHLPA executive board will begin the process to have players approval to disclaim if no agreement is concluded by today.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-03 18:00:11	@NHL @NHLPA  STEAL the thunder from the NFL / Playoffs and get this done today.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-03 18:47:14	@Real_ESPNLeBrun  Is that a good or bad sign? TBD
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-04 05:32:31	@sn_nhl The OWNERS are a JOKE. Cap 70.2 Mil yr 1 then 60 mil yr 2 give me a break who would agree to that!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-04 15:16:12	The @NHL is making a mockery of the game and it's FANS, used to be a blue collar sport  FANS could afford to go to. But not anymore.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-04 15:48:26	@NHLOwners has anybody seen the movie starring Gary Bettman Liar, Liar from 04-05?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-04 15:59:06	@NHL has anyone seen that movie from 04-05 called Liar, Liar starring Gary Bettman ?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-02 21:20:23	@ChrisBottaNHL I just wish it hadn't taken this long to figure out how a negotiation worked. I hope they can get it worked out. Big Day!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-04 16:31:07	@NHLOwners @AlCimaglia Not uncommon in union negotiations. Once the person gets a feel for how things work then they will join the comittee.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-04 16:57:15	@walsha Souds like Bettman should have a conversation with Selig to get his head straight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-04 17:26:37	@NYP_Brooksie So it's the players fault that they work hard / talented  and  the GM's  try and out bid each other and jack up  prices. HMMMM
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-04 17:30:26	@NYP_Brooksie  Don't pay them if you don't think it's worth it. Do what the New England Patriots do, say gbye to that player and draft well
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-04 17:33:26	Bettman tells players GMs want to dismantle teams because of regretful contracts. Other details from Thurs http://t.co/5dDkOIKW
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-04 17:46:57	@AngryNHLFans  Disagree!!! Should be @NHLOwners take to much!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-02 22:12:35	@AngryNHLFans @Flyer_Bully Pensions are very important for NHLPA where the average career is less than 5 years.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-04 20:49:03	I know a lot of @NHL FANS that r just fed up with Bettman/Owners and their lies. They basically have told me they just DON'T care anymore. 1
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-04 20:50:23	that they will not spend another dime on the @NHL again. This is going to be a LONG road to recovery I am afraid.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-04 20:57:23	@TSNBobMcKenzie Reinhart's said his stick Trocheck's stick and just came up. I have watched the replay over and over and it never touched it
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-07 18:37:17	@HockeyyInsiderr @strombone1 Going to be an interesting week and a half. I think there are  going to be quite a few trades after Wed.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-06 16:48:03	The @NHL is going to have to wait a season before I spend any of my $ on you.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-06 17:31:53	@miss_deyo AMEN to that....
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-12 14:07:27	More details starting to emerge on CBA as MOU gets closer to finish line...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-11 15:42:24	@styleswild so what do u do with the sticks with they didn't like?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-11 17:47:40	@candacecbure I would think that it must be more uncomfortable for you to fo do than for your husband to watch.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-11 18:31:42	Give @NHLexpertpicks  a follow.  Good Stuff.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-11 18:54:27	@Russostrib   r u saying we are going to see Paul Mara sooner than anticipated?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-11 21:01:12	@FrankViola16 NOBODY! and I mean NOBODY! Threw the high fastball like you did.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-09 17:13:51	@Russostrib The only thing that scares me about Heatley is can he keep up with that line.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-01-07 05:02:51	@TomPelissero They missed Rosenfels I don't care what anyone says. Didnt like that they cut him after camp and it really hurt them yesterday

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-04 18:55:58	Multiple sources say the #mnwild has traded Darroll Powe to the #nyrangers for Micheael Rupp
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-04 19:00:11	@Russostrib better deal for the #NYR
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-04 19:04:54	Don't like the deal Mike Rupp for Palmieri and Powe.  The #MNWILD should have at least gotten a pick thrown in.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-08 16:48:21	@Russostrib @Prt_Tme_Goalie1  He is the real deal.  Been one of the best D-Men to this point.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-11 16:12:12	@PAKFANVikes , no team was hurt more by the lockout (no preseason, short camp) given the nearly 40 percentroster turnover.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-11 16:13:19	@ChuckNewton9 @PAKFANVikes  Takes more than just a oouple weeks for a team to gel.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-12 15:46:57	@1500ESPNJudd  Vikes should pick up Knox like they always do with ex Bears.  NOT!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-11 22:38:54	@blakeshelton when are you coming to MN ?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-12 18:19:38	@FSNGorg  KG doesn't granny need to play more physical like he did against Nashville? I thought that was his best game thus far.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-14 15:52:02	@KFAN1003 @pavikesvox BOOGAARD most popular by far.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-12 20:20:15	@Russostrib Do you see PMB being moved possibly?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-13 15:21:17	@Russostrib @PeterRip2 They need to find a way to get J.Iginla from the Flames.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-11 22:32:41	@walz3737 REALLY like the line Heater-Granny-Seto..
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-10 09:13:33	@Russostrib hopefully this gets Seto started. I really like him Heater and Granny together...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-13 15:52:00	@Russostrib @PeterRip2 Absolutely He needs a change. The Flames are terrible team, he aways looks good against us I think he just needs out
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-20 20:52:54	@TerriClarkMusic AMEN!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-13 17:15:04	@Real_ESPNLeBrun Do you think MN would have any intrest in him?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-19 16:24:22	Will the @mnwild trade PMB or Seto?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-14 16:17:39	@nathenstridge Same to you ;)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-21 15:12:30	@MorganLorrie I'm in,  Oh I could use one right now.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-14 16:19:22	Happy Valentines Day to all!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-14 16:41:24	@Russostrib R they brining someone up?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-21 17:18:25	@ChrisKuc They shouldn't be mad they have player just like that in Burrows.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-21 18:43:55	@walsha @ut_pez  depends where they are happening the most? is it open ice, blind side or from behind. they need to allow more interference
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-14 19:55:14	@nathenstridge UM excuse me I don't think you need to lose weight. Just sayin =)

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-20 15:16:12	@SNHockeyCentral @Sportsnet  How good could Lindy Ruff be if he had top talent to coach. He has thrived for years without top end talent.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-22 14:33:13	@Russostrib DIRTY,DIRTY,DIRTY.  He had no reason to hit Clutter. He should be suspended for a while.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-22 14:37:25	@Russostrib any word on what the injury is yet and how bad?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-22 15:35:11	I keep reading all these tweets that Hall's hit on Clutterbuck was not DIRTY. If  u think that then you don't know the game.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-20 17:07:55	@IATEMYBROTHER @SNHockeyCentral @Sportsnet  He get's the most out of what he has, his time has probably run out like Lemaire's did in MN.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-20 17:09:05	@PhilBrowns He get's the most out of what he has, his time has probably run out like Lemaire's did in MN.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-20 22:57:04	@Russostrib who has more swagger? I think Bruno does
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-22 17:46:58	@Russostrib @dstaples BIG difference in the two hits,   Clutterbuck just  pushed Hall. U NEVER go after someone's knee DIRTY,DIRTY  hit.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-22 18:49:06	@usahockey Buzz Schnieder
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-22 21:13:35	Hall must have something against the @mnwild 1st Brodin &amp; now Clutterbuck, I wouldn't want to be him the rest of this season.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-26 17:39:43	@CCtsn Richard should be one of them
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-28 14:31:34	@AmeliaRayno had to be one of the greatest games you have ever covered as a Gopher BB beat writer.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-02-28 15:50:47	@JohnQHockey @TomPelissero Biggest mistake they made was keeping Webb and letting Sage go. Sage is the perfect vet backup.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-05 15:49:27	@mnwild @fsnorth @KFAN1003 really like the way they are playing right now. Let's get the Hawks tonight boys!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-05 18:58:26	@AmeliaRayno @travistwinstalk  toughest schedule in the country and you end up a 10 seed.  Not sure I agree either.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-05 20:42:16	@johnkriesel they should start taxing clothing instead of gas for sure.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-05 21:01:19	@TheHawkMobile Should be a good game tonight. The Wild are starting to look like the team we thought they would be. CHEERS!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-05 21:04:57	@MissyDeyo If had to rank your 3 most favorite sports in order, what would they be?

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-06 15:10:28	@1500ESPNJudd @JeffDubay @1500ESPN  I thought they got it handed to them in the first played much better in the 2nd and outplayed them in3rd
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-06 15:27:18	@Vikings @wobby Best fit would be Jennings, he already knows the west coast offense.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-06 15:31:14	@Russostrib @MN507Nice I could see them trading PMB for a Veteran Defenseman.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-06 17:47:27	@TheTourneyy  Should go back to Private and Public School Tourney. Same Teams Over and Over.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-06 18:07:32	@Soderboobs @FollowThePuck I have IE and mine is not working either.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-06 18:14:11	Maybe I am old fashion, But I love waking up to the same women I went to bed with. If you know what I mean.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-04 16:19:04	@HockeyyInsiderr Only way a team would be intrested is if the Leafs were to absorb some of the $.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-04 19:44:14	@PaulCharchian CANCER!!!! No Thank U!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-04 19:50:13	The @mnwild  R starting to gel....Look out Blackhawks here we come!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-04 21:23:37	@AdrianPeterson if he didn't worry about trying to beat ur record,  his team might actually win..... Who cares about what CJ has to say...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-12 14:09:09	Still NOT sold on Musgrave! I believe that Musgrave is the reason for the short comings of Ponder. Which is why Harvin is gone.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-12 14:10:12	@PAKFANVikes @PeteBercich @ProFootballTalk @cponder7  Musgrave is the problem in my eyes NEVER proven as a OC.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-12 14:40:31	@PaulCharchian How much of this has to do with Musgrave. Remember they had to change the routes the recievers were running mid-season.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-12 15:30:01	@Russostrib headed back to Houston?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-12 16:11:18	@1500ESPNJudd Need a top FA WR or it's going to be a LONG season / wasted year for AP, Probably why he made comments he did yesterday.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-12 17:38:56	@StribDW Peterson gets the shaft in this whole deal if they don't go and get a #1 reciever. Thus his comments yesterday.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-12 21:05:04	@AdamSchefter Nice move for Andy Ried.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-13 01:29:18	@TomPelissero tough pill to swallow if your AP and JA , If they don't sign him. I would ask to be traded if they don't not fair to them.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-13 01:32:18	What a BS hit on Zucker by Perry. It was so late the Wild already won the cup.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-13 01:34:13	@martinamcbride  I hear ya, My wife likes those types of days too. Nothing wrong with that you deserve it. When are you coming to MN again?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-13 01:39:14	@Russostrib DIRTY, DIRTY,DIRTY!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-13 03:12:28	@johnkriesel Cheap shot changed the game.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-10 07:41:06	@martinamcbride @Pink  My family LOVES listening to the both of you. Your music is amazing.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-10 07:44:55	@Pink Father time know where he can put his spring. HAHAHAHA =)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-13 13:25:24	@SNHockeyCentral @Sportsnet He can say all he wants, hit to the head that was way to late. NO EXCUSES!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-13 15:48:45	The @Vikings should throw in the towel. Don't know how u look at #28 &amp; #69  and tell them they have a chance. What r u replacing #12 with?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-13 16:47:50	@SportsnetSpec Would be great pick up for the @mnwild
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-13 17:06:54	@Russostrib Now that Ben Eager is on waivers, would he be a player the Wild would look at?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-14 15:36:25	@Russostrib @PAKFANVikes @JoeNelsonKFAN @KFAN1003  Do you think the Wild would have interest in recently waived Oiler Ben Eager?

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-14 16:38:54	@fsnorth @KFAN1003 @PAKFANVikes @walz3737 Possibly Heatley to New Jersey was the speculation earlier in the week.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-14 16:53:38	@GregJennings PLEASE sign in MN. Would be awesome to finally have a #1WR on the roster. I  would love to see Jennings,Simps, Wright &amp; Rudolf
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-14 17:44:30	@mnwild Chicago,  because of the history between MN and Chicago going back to the Northstar days.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-14 19:36:15	@PaulCharchian  I love it!  Now they just have to sign Jennings.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-14 19:37:33	@PaulCharchian Not a bad recieveing core if u have Jennings,Simpson, Wright and Rudolph. Way better then last year. If they can sign him.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-11 13:55:04	@kerinoble1 @Pink @cities97radio OH MAN my wife would love those tickets. DANG IT.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-15 13:48:28	@PAKFANVikes @GregJennings  crossing my fingers hoping he signs with us.  Ain't no mountain high enough.............
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-15 18:35:56	@Russostrib He already is.  LOTS of potential in that young man.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-14 20:46:26	@Pink I hear ya! Karma is a BITCH!!

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-21 13:12:53	@Russostrib There was no full body contact at all. Kronwall has gotten away with these types of hits for years.Shoulder to Head are only.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-21 15:03:52	@HockeyyInsiderr That is the exact type of hit that the NHL says they are trying to get rid of.  Kronwall is a PUNK!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-21 16:44:47	Heyt @1500ESPNJudd  can u ask Louie what his thoughts were on the Kronwall hit on Coyle.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-19 19:07:52	@Russostrib who do you think the Wild will go after at the trade deadline? 3 Names
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-19 19:15:36	@Russostrib I agree, why mortgage the future when they are playing like this. I bet this has been a nice change for u after the past 5yrs.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-03-21 20:46:19	@NHLexpertpicks Kronwall is a punk!

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-02 15:05:02	@PAKFANVikes  They need to find a way to get Ryane Clowe.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-02 15:08:42	@PAKFANVikes  Can you ask Russo about Jagr possibly as a rental?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-03 19:37:25	Way to go @mnwild on aquiring a player who has avg. 62pts per season  in @JasonPominville. LOVE IT!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-03 19:42:42	@FSNGorg Agreed! He has such a quick release on his shot. I just hope they can sign him for a couple more years.  A lot to give up if rental
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-03 21:44:33	@Russostrib biggest concern is if they can sign Pom to a contract extension.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-02 20:10:16	@walsha @Deadspin He should NOT be allowed to coach. PERIOD!!! What a BUM!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-05 20:18:17	@AndrewOnHockey @Russostrib I was happy to see him leave MN. Not a team player. I coach u12 girls team that r more physical then Gabby.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-03 15:13:27	@Russostrib What's ur gut tell you, do the #Wild  make a move today?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-04 15:21:08	@Russostrib  anyword on Heater's wrist injury?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-03 16:41:34	@Russostrib That would be a nice addittion to this squad.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-03 19:17:28	@FSNGorg KG do you like the move or is it to much. He had  G:30 A:43 last year.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-03 19:19:42	@PaulCharchian They aquired a real nice player here. He is really going to help the squad.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-03 21:06:32	@DanBarreiroKFAN  at least he has year of HC experience. Could have went after an asst. that had none.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-08 20:36:18	@PAKFANVikes loved it when you asked Pom if he was a Packer Fan today, Then asked him if he was sure of it,  love ur show, listen everyday.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-10 19:42:59	@AmeliaRayno He'll be fine, lesson learned I am sure. Great person to have on the staff if they can recruit out of NY.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-14 04:26:24	Koivu has to quit passing up shots. He is the reason that they lost tonight in my opinion.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-14 04:27:44	@mnwild should have held on to Kassian. He would have been better than Rupp just sayin.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-12 16:00:40	The @mnwild have lost their physical play over the past 4-5 games. Must get back to it if they are going to start winning again.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-12 21:32:06	@Russostrib will anyone be sent down?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-11 16:00:35	@Russostrib @BReynoldsMN 
Taylor Hall is not becoming a dirty player, he is a dirty player. What a chump!!!

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-11 19:36:01	@SNHockeyCentral @Sportsnet He is a punk and a dirty player who doesn't have to be.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-11 20:31:42	@myNHLTradeRumor Intent to injure for sure. He should have been punished. He better keep his head up cuz it's coming.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-11 20:39:29	@myNHLTradeRumor That's how Koivu broke his leg a few years back in Vancouver. What's gotten into this kid. He doesn't need to play that way

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-15 16:45:31	@mnwildPR @fsnorth @KFAN1003  fingers crossed c'mon  boyz.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-22 14:37:38	The @mnwild Defense must get tougher in front of our own net. I won't blame Backstrom after he makes the first save.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-22 20:46:28	@Russostrib @TheMultz The defensive pairings have not been good in my opinion. We need to get a little more nasty in front of our own net.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-23 16:02:58	@Russostrib Do you think Dowell and Velliux help this team the rest of the way?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-23 16:08:15	@JoeNelsonKFAN That would be nice. #NEEDIT
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-23 19:43:43	@Russostrib weird stat of the of the day. @mnwild are 11-6 with Nate Prosser in the line-up. #justsayin
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-24 05:44:15	@BigKennyTV  I said who do you love.....
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-24 05:45:52	@Russostrib I liked Dowells speed tonight. Should have kept Kassian.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-24 05:51:01	@Russostrib @NHLbyMatty  AMEN to that, I will argue with anyone on this, superstar in the making.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-24 05:59:34	@NHLexpertpicks Dustin Brown is a douche bag.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-24 13:18:52	@russostrib Do you think that Brown will be suspended?  Do think concussion for Pominville?  #hopenot
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-24 13:48:22	@PAKFANVikes @JoeNelsonKFAN  PA EVERYDAY!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-24 14:08:03	@myNHLTradeRumor Yes, If he had led with his shoulder and not his elbow then it would have been different.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-24 14:24:45	@MuoioMatt @myNHLTradeRumor  C'MON watch the video. He clearly threw his elbow into Pominville's chin.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-24 14:46:52	@MuoioMatt @myNHLTradeRumor Agreed. 1or 2 games.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-24 18:47:19	@Russostrib I'm sorry but how in the H-E dbl hockey sticks does an NHL ref miss that. #whatajoke
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-25 17:36:08	@Russostrib I assume Pominville out for regular season. ? for playoffs if we get there.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-25 19:03:31	This @leannrimes song/video is one of my favorites should of been a #1 #justsayin...: http://t.co/CffBn9P9PU via @youtube
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-26 21:02:19	@FSNGorg any reason Yeo doesn't give Prosser more playing time, Wild is 11-6 with him in the line up this year.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-26 16:12:34	@Georgette_Jones I am so sorry for your loss.  Prayers to you and your family.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-26 19:40:18	@FSNGorg BIG Game tonight! Let's end this magnificient day with a "W"
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-04-29 20:13:12	The @mnwild is one of 7 teams to beat the Hawks this year. If Backstrom can get HOT look for the Wild to take this series in 7.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-03 14:21:26	LET'S GO @mnwild !!!!!! 
LET'S GO @mnwild !!!!!!
LET'S GO @mnwild !!!!!! 
#GAMEDAY
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-03 15:06:23	@MinnesotaWildMN  YES!!!! He can still score.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-02 16:09:07	@Russostrib  had to be Clutter, He most always shoots high.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-06 14:18:54	@Russostrib  What a joke! I would put him against anyone of them players.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-06 14:23:05	@Russostrib like listening to the announcers on NBC yest. they had their heads so far up the Hawks butt I had to turn it off and listen KFAN
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-06 16:52:48	@Russostrib  I wish they would have played Dowell in this series. Rupp is just to slow.  I can see why NYR let him go.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-08 18:02:40	@blakeshelton  Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-08 18:04:47	Zucker has the best nose to the net right now and he is not on the @mnwild PP. HMMMM!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-08 18:25:31	@Russostrib He is right but he needs to play better, any reason Zucker is not on the PP? #hothand
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-07 18:28:19	@EJHradek_NHL AGREED!!!! #BURROWS
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-07 19:39:30	@DTE3 @CareyPenaTV  Wow! Big Surpise there......
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-09 16:33:33	@PAKFANVikes Can you ask why Zucker is not on the PP?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-14 21:39:29	@BUrlacher54 are you going to join the purple people eaters? Cuz we would love to have you. SKOL VIKES!!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-22 20:07:49	@SNHockeyCentral @Sportsnet Bring Back Crawford!  Bring Back Crawford!  Bring Back Crawford!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-21 20:42:09	@mnwild should have hired Phil Housley and made him a special assistant for the PP. The PP killed the wild against the Hawks.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-05-31 14:21:53	@1NatalieMaines  a bug. LOL =)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-06-04 21:13:53	@DarrenDreger Need to get rid of the Trapezoid.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-06-28 18:14:55	@Russostrib  any ideas on who will take over the Iowa Wild not that Torch is gone?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-07-03 16:39:01	@Russostrib  any idea on the potential FA Defensemen  the Wild might look at?

Slow dancing, just me and my girl
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-07-01 03:52:51	@1NatalieMaines why I awtta!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-07-01 04:21:15	I love what the @mnwild  did today. I know they will be the team to beat in years to come.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-07-01 04:29:17	@MissyDeyo MN is nice. Come see the Mall of America. You can stay right there and  maybe take in a Twins or Wild game.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-07-01 17:43:52	The @mnwild should pick up Keith Ballard.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-07-02 17:26:34	@Russostrib @walz3737 @KFAN1003 Would the Wild have any intrest in Keith Ballard?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-07-16 21:08:08	@TheRealAliL No Barbie.... When my wife was with her sister there they kept calling her Barbie. LOL
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-07-18 04:21:58	@leannrimes Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-07-29 14:55:17	@martinamcbride HAPPY B-Day!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-07-30 04:03:04	@GuyFieri I live in MN. Is Smalley's in Stillwater worth it?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-07-30 18:33:43	@boyband25 Can't wait to try it.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-07-31 17:33:08	Will Justin Morneau be traded today?  #needmorepowerfromthecornerspot
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-07-31 21:51:30	@Vikings I see #4 and I get the chills. What would Favre have done with a team like this.  #icanonlyimagine
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-07-31 19:47:24	@StribDW  to be cont..........
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-08-13 15:43:41	@candacecbure  before you know it they will be graduating H.S. , and you thought  M.S. is tough. I had a lump in my thoat all yr.  #sotough
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-08-13 15:18:17	@Russostrib will he be traded this year?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-08-22 02:24:23	Looking forward to seeing the unveiling of the new @mnwild  white jerseys at the @mnstatefair .

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-08-27 20:19:39	Jared Allen was VERY upset about league ruling on Kevin Williams low-blow! "He had intent" to harm. #dontblamehimforbeingupset
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-08-27 20:51:40	@KFAN1003 @AjKFAN  Don't Blame him. I would stand up for my teammate as well. DIRTY,DIRTY play.

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-10 19:50:46	@AccessVikings It's not enough, are they going to wait until he ends someones career before they do something harsh like he did. C'MON!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-10 20:07:14	@PAKFANVikes It's not enough, are they going to wait until he ends someones career before they do something harsh like he did. C'MON!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-10 17:35:33	@JayGlazer he should be suspended, Multiple offender.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-12 17:27:13	@Russostrib  Welcome back Russo!  Do you think the Wild will be able to re-sign him to a new deal?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-13 15:07:19	@Russostrib Speaking of Ballard, does he have anything left in the tank.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-13 20:08:40	@Russostrib did Jonathon Blum get invited to camp?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-17 16:01:01	@walz3737 Can't wait, wish I was going tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-17 23:51:12	@Russostrib  will Konopka make the roster this year?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-18 02:25:32	@Russostrib  how does Ballard look?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-20 01:22:19	@MnWildGirl r u watching the game?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-20 02:10:29	@MnWildGirl Thx awesome
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-20 02:40:31	@Russostrib Nice game for the boys tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-20 05:10:22	@mnwild looked really good tonight. Granlund, Coyle, Dumba and Haula were very good tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-20 05:12:30	@mnwild  I wish you would wear the MN Fighting Saints Jerseys at least once a year since you are playing on the same surface as they did.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-20 05:38:08	@Russostrib Yeo has some tough decisions to make. I thought Haula, Granlund and Dumba were very good tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-18 03:19:33	@AWKD @Russostrib  I have always liked Ballard could be a very nice pick up for the Wild. Best hip checker in the game.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-18 03:47:52	@Russostrib  If Dumba makes the squad who is the odd man out on D?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-25 16:32:40	@Russostrib Seems like to many Centers on this team. Who is the odd man out?  Konopka?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-23 04:12:09	@TSNBobMcKenzie I get it but being a former hockey player and Kessel fan, a stick should never be used as weapon.  NOT COOL!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-23 05:04:07	@MissyDeyo Me too! Did you happen to see the Brawl tonight between leafs an Sabers?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-23 14:51:34	@KFAN1003 I guess the starters should have played more in the pre-season, it's quite obvious they were not prepared for the season.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-23 14:59:21	@PAKFANVikes Sorry, But this team is to talented to not be ready to play.I am on the FIRE Frazier band wagon now.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-23 15:02:26	@chipscoggins @1500ESPNJudd Unbelievable!!! See ya Frazier!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-27 19:19:46	@Russostrib Do you think they will sign him? I think he is a better 4th line Center than Konopka.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-01 15:12:39	@PAKFANVikes  can you ask mike if they plan on picking up any players to fill Rupp's roll
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-01 15:48:47	@imheathergraham totally agree.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-30 14:07:21	@Russostrib who do you see being available?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-28 01:15:28	@imheathergraham to much!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-28 01:19:22	@Russostrib Setting up to be a  nice rivalry
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-28 02:21:32	@Russostrib is Pom okay?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-09-30 16:11:17	@MNSportsTalk I won't watch the Twins until the owners start showing there Fans that they are willing to win.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-02 21:40:59	Who was the first @mnwild player to score a hat trick?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-03 14:04:50	@MinnHockey @mnwild @XcelEnergyCtr  BOOM!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-04 20:20:53	@AdamSchefter Have you heard anything on who is intrested in Josh Freeman?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-04 20:25:31	@VikingsReport  I agree! You always hear GM's say they will do whatever makes the team better, Well Josh Freeman will make tis team better.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-03 14:33:29	@Vikings @nflnetwork Josh Freeman
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-03 18:17:17	@AdamSchefter  I hope the Vikings pick him up.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-07 16:32:52	@PaulCharchian Aren't they both bitten by the same bug. To many different OC and coaches every year.  No stability.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-11 16:53:00	@Russostrib He has not looked good to me, I thought he looked decent in pre-season though.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-09 14:45:25	@KFAN1003 I blame Schiano for Freeman's trouble.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-16 04:08:21	@ZooeyDeschanel You are one of favorite actresses. So talented in so many ways.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-14 15:19:07	@PAKFANVikes  This is exactly what happens when players don't believe in their coaching staff. HC,OC,DC  not one of them has proven anything
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-14 15:21:10	@PAKFANVikes Neither of these coaches has proven anything at there postions.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-16 15:35:22	@PAKFANVikes I would love to have Jon Gruden as our coach. No knock to Frazier just think there are better coaches out there.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-17 20:57:18	@joshturnermusic Can't wait to see this weekend at T.I. Casino. We are taking my daughter Ellie Newton for her B-Day. She is so pumped.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-18 16:30:48	@blakeshelton Sayin' don't you know me I'm your native son
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-22 04:34:27	@thesuperstar68 mike u know there r better coaches out there. 2 much talent 2 be this bad.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-22 04:36:08	@thesuperstar68 bring on Gruden please...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-23 17:48:18	@boyband25 @Vikings Man I am so over it. This team has enough talent to win with the right coaching staff.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-25 17:09:49	For the first time in my life I have NO intrest in watching the @Vikings play the Packers.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-29 17:36:11	The @vikings organization is a JOKE! Hire a proven winner. Can't stand it anymore.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-30 14:01:03	@boyband25 That looks like it would be a fun job.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-10-31 19:56:25	@joshturnermusic You concert @ Treasure Island Casino MN was amazing.  Went there for my daughters B-DAY and she loved every  minute. Thanks
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-01 15:52:40	@TSN_Sports Nice story line for tonight. Wild were looking @ Michel Therrien as a replacement for Richards but went with Yeo instead.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-01 16:16:33	@Minnesota_KICKS  Century's Men's Soccer Team, Regional NJCAA Champs, play Joliet JC on 11/2, 12 pm, Park HS, (not Mahtomedi HS),
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-01 20:57:26	Let's go @mnwild !!!  Should be interesting Parise and Koivu on seprate lines for the first time tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-04 17:10:30	@MissyDeyo That is so so so nasty.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-06 19:36:55	@Russostrib The 'C" word icky!  I thought he seemed a little out of it when he and Stoner ended up on the same side of the ice.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-07 17:33:06	Watched @OITNB last night for the 1x, it was awesome. Can totally undertand why @TaySchilling wanted to play that role. What a story.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-08 21:27:16	I just saw @AmeliaRayno strutin her stuff in front of the podium... Stay local Reid... for Petino's sake.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-08 21:46:34	@WCCORosen Sid says Good Luck getting job in the Twin Cities when you come back. What happen to loyalty in our state?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-11 19:09:08	@AjKFAN @KFAN1003 Still the right thing to do.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-11 19:14:26	Thank you to all my family and friends for the sacrifices you have made to keep us safe. God Bless you all and Happy Veterans Day!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-08 22:33:18	@WCCORosen I agree Rosie, Just having fun. The ONLY way Petino get's that recruit is by winning, we all know that. Bld.it and they will come
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-13 22:21:48	@WCCORosen Happy B-Day Rosie! I hope you have a great rest of the day.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-15 18:08:27	@AccessVikings @PatrickReusse To much talent on this team for it to look this bad. Coaching staff has to go maybe even GM.Bring in a winner.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-14 14:25:28	@Russostrib They were a dirty team last night. I liiked how fiesty Brodz got late in the game they needed more of that from that line.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-14 18:14:43	@Russostrib What if it was Raffi Torres? What bothered me about the hit was him coming up to hit him in the head and leaving his feet.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-14 18:15:49	@AWKD @Russostrib  Brodz needs to play like that more...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-14 18:20:41	@AWKD @Russostrib  I agree!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-18 20:49:57	@realmikefox @MrsThing1  and a hockey game to boot.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-18 22:09:27	Nice WIN!! by the @mnwild last night. Looks like this is going to be a nice rivalry for years to come.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-19 16:29:20	@AWKD @Vikings @Twins  If the Vikings don't go out and get a proven winning head coach and the Twins don't start spending some money im done
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-19 16:32:21	@AWKD @Vikings @Twins  at least we have the @mnwild and @MNTimberwolves to look forward too. Very similar situations. Wolves get proven(1)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-19 16:34:37	@AWKD @Vikings @Twins @mnwild @MNTimberwolves winning head coach and are now winning. Wild spend money on some top players and are winning.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-19 16:50:21	@AWKD @Vikings @Twins @mnwild @MNTimberwolves I agree but they also haven't spent the money they promised they would if we built the stadium
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-19 17:05:13	@AWKD @Vikings @Twins @mnwild I am not saying that either but how can the Twins not have at least 1 ACE pItcher. Someone to guide the youth
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-19 17:06:35	@AWKD  @Twins @mnwild The @Vikings need a proven winner as a coach. They have way to much talent to be this bad IMO.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-19 17:32:56	@AWKD @Vikings @Twins I agree but some of the Twins best yrs were when they had the 1 ACE that they knew gave them a chance, Radke, Santana
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-19 17:35:42	@AWKD  @Twins I bet if the @Vikings had Gruden as a HC and a decent DC they would be in the playoffs.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-19 17:39:09	@AWKD @Twins @Vikings You are reading my mind!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-19 18:15:55	@1500ESPNJudd C'MON it doesn't matter who the QB is, Favre would suck in this offense. Not one good coach on this staff.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-22 18:31:28	@WiebeSunSports @Russostrib Same old story for Seto, All the potential in the world with no drive to be the best.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-23 16:24:11	@AmeliaRayno oh how I wish I could be there.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-21 15:28:46	What are the @Twins doing? Where is the promise? We need this new stadium to be competitive, REALLY!!!!!! #DONEWITHTHEM
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-20 17:51:34	@MNSportsTalk Hire Gruden and go after Johhny Football!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-25 18:23:16	@Russostrib Could it be the result of the hit he took against Toronto?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-11-25 18:28:07	@xtina @AGreatBigWorld  it was obvious how much passion you have for this song. #awesome
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-02 17:13:51	@Russostrib Haula has looked awfully good.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-02 21:49:49	@Russostrib @OBrandser Shooting where the goalie isn't....
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-03 14:42:15	Nice WIN by the @mnwild  last night. Physical and Fast.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-03 18:09:41	@1500ESPN I would much rather have AJ.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-10 04:01:35	@LaVelleNeal are @Twins  serious about Arroyo? That would really help this team with 3 legit starters. #needitbad
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-10 17:08:15	@TonyDean1204 @G_Olsen90  Tony hit the nail on head, no pun intended.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-10 17:48:59	@thechrismcnally He should hang'em up.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-11 17:47:58	@PaulCharchian I am in a pickle, who should I start  Rivers or Brady this week?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-11 17:48:35	@PaulCharchian would you start Donald Brown or Shane Vereen this week?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-12 01:53:07	@TonyDean1204 @mnwild  must be physical if they want to win in Anaheim tonight. We always seem to get pushed around there.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-11 06:58:55	@GopherSports pretty awesome. I love what Richard is doing. They will be fine I just hope he sticks around.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-13 04:44:27	@JJN1196 @Russostrib what a joke? Worst crew I've seen all year.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-12 06:05:29	@TonyDean1204 they always seem to swallow there whistle when we play there.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-13 05:51:04	@TonyDean1204 I agree
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-18 21:17:44	@SNHockeyCentral This is the type of hit that has to go away. He never even made an attempt to play the puck.  The game needs to change.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-16 18:55:32	I really hope the @Twins add Arroyo. That would be an excellent rotation with experience and youth.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-23 15:09:10	The @mnwild just aren't physical enough and get pushed around by other teams in front of their nets. And we aren't tough enough in our zone
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-23 15:44:15	@Proteautype @ZachLowe_NBA  AMEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2013-12-29 21:22:24	Maybe I am alone on this, but the @Vikings have so many needs, with a coach on his way out, so let's win and loose draft position.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-02 20:31:33	@NHLPlayerSafety @TSNBobMcKenzie Same thing Steen did to Spurgeon earlier this year. What a chump, if u want to do something drop the gloves
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-06 02:21:09	@TonyDean1204 @Vikings I still want Manziel he's a winner.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-06 03:23:30	@TonyDean1204 @Vikings @TonyDean1204 @Vikings I agree, I just think Bortels is a lot like Ponder was coming out of college IMO.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-06 15:37:37	C'MON @vikings go get Wisenhunt you know he is the right guy. Proven HC and a WINNER!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-06 17:09:43	@DarrenDreger I wish the @mnwild would do the same with Dany Heatley....
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-07 14:37:28	@1500ESPN  I would say #1 Wisenhunt proven Winner and a HC, #2  Jay Gruden good OC and also has some HC exp. as Arena League Champs twice.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-05 22:35:42	I am with @PaulCharchian, I REALLY hope the Vikes hire Ken Wisenhunt.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-07 15:37:39	@PAKFANVikes I totally disagree look what Wiz did with Rothlisberger when he was drafted. He can draft his QB this year. He's a WINNER!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-05 23:13:09	@iMinnesotaSport I hope Ken Wisenhunt. He is the perfect coach for this team.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-05 23:18:31	The @Vikings would be making a huge mistake if they don't hire Ken Wisenhunt. He is a great coach, been to the Super Bowl as a HC great OC.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-06 00:51:25	@TheRealCarlG @DanBarreiroKFAN Sorry Carl, NOT!!!!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-06 00:58:20	@PAKFANVikes is there any reason the @Vikings don't go after Ken Wisenhunt?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-08 06:22:44	What a nice win by the young bucks tonight. Way to go @mnwild  @TonyDean1204
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-08 14:51:21	@1500ESPNJudd @JeffDubay one of the best games ever by a Wild goalie IMO. WOW was he confident in the shoot out.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-08 16:08:00	@KFAN1003 @PAKFANVikes  Pete Carroll is a retread!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-08 17:55:35	@JayGlazer Hopefully for the @Vikings ! Love Johnny Football
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-08 18:16:29	Will the @vikings have to move up to take Johnny Football? Would anyone want Kubiak and Phillips as Coaches?  #couldbeafit
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-09 06:02:38	@johnkriesel no kidding, what gave that away?  the way he speaks? Cuz I can't understand anything he says either.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-09 15:22:36	@PAKFANVikes A great Offense is the best Defense now in the NFL. If Zimmer comes here with a great OC, It will become the OC carousel.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-15 15:34:09	@RapSheet I would think that the @vikings would want to know who the OC might be before they hire him. I keep hearing Linehan (good  pic)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-16 15:43:35	@JASully65 @Vikings What do you think of Norv Turner?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-16 15:56:13	@RapSheet I hope the @vikings keep him. He has done a great job.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-16 17:30:13	@DanBarreiroKFAN @PAKFANVikes Looks like he did, HAHAHAHA!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-15 19:30:17	@StribSports @AccessVikings @SouhanStrib  I hope that they retain STC Mike Preifer
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-15 20:31:21	@HilaryDuff I'm with you, the only ones that need to know the truth do anyways.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-20 05:47:09	@RapSheet @MikeGarafolo @Seahawks right, wrong whatever terrible interview, what a douche....
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-27 02:26:02	@kerinoble1 feel the same way about Swift, but I love Pink.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-26 06:39:11	@Pink me, my wife and kids love everything about you.  I hope someday to see you in concert with my family. Cheers!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-26 05:08:02	@mnwild r getting their ass kicked. And nobody is sticking up for Parise. Arrrrrgh!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-29 19:20:12	@TonyDeanTHW I still think he ends up in @mnwild uniform next year.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-29 20:23:43	@TonyDeanTHW @mnwild Agreed, also one of his best friends is Jason Pomenville.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-30 06:54:56	@1NatalieMaines good bye earl!😉
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-30 21:01:24	@Buccigross @brianlawton9 Agreed, I would pick him too. I actually think he should be the Captain of the @mnwild IMO.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-01-30 22:26:36	@GregJennings @philmoredaley With coach Turner at the helm, this offense will be much improved. I see Mr. Jennings having a very nice year.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-05 16:21:20	@PAKFANVikes  Who would you rather have Cassel or McCown.  I think they are both serviceable.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-05 15:01:56	@PAKFANVikes  I think he just wants to be paid like a starter,don't blame him. I think he would do well under a Turner offense.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-05 21:39:39	@Russostrib I hope the @mnwild make the same choice for Mikko if he is not 100%.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-05 22:09:47	@PAKFANVikes @FSNGorg @Russostrib LOVE IT!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-05 22:11:01	@PAKFANVikes @FSNGorg @Russostrib 9-0 for Mike Yeo! 9-0 for Mike Yeo!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-05 18:09:50	@TonyDeanTHW @HockeyyInsiderr @mnwild I don't think it matters who he goes too. He is still going to test FA and his wifes family is from MN
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-05 18:11:52	@TonyDeanTHW @HockeyyInsiderr @mnwild  also did I forget to mention that Jason Pominville is his best buddy.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-06 21:16:08	@mnwild could really send a message with a big win tonight. LET'S GO WILD!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-06 04:25:41	@AmeliaRayno still like the direction our program is going under Pitino.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-07 19:15:58	Feel so bad for Mikko Koivu right now.  He is just a great guy. #atruecompetitor
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-06 05:37:26	@VikingsReport not that big a deal. I wish Cassel would stay, but McCowan would do just as well.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-07 21:48:31	@JaredAllen69 @LeadTheWayFund Very cool, I really hope that you stay with the Vikes, I would love to see what you can do under coach Zimmer.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-08 00:35:59	I do feel bad for a friend of mine who's family has had season tickets since day 1 of @Vikings but now will have to give them up because SLB
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-07 17:16:48	@russosfilter He was already assigned to the minors.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-07 17:19:22	@russosfilter LOL!!! The other teams should be giving him the choke sign for missing on so many breakaways this yr.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-10 19:00:01	@TonyDeanTHW @usahockey If they do,  do you think the @mnwild will have to think about giving Parise the 'C" ?  I do....
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-10 19:13:54	@TonyDeanTHW @usahockey @mnwild Don't get me wrong, I think Mikko is very good player. I just think the team takes on mellow personality IMO
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-13 18:54:34	@SNHockeyCentral I think that he will stay as Buf is going to want to much for a rental.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-14 20:38:08	@AccessVikings Ponder will be a much better QB under Norv Turner that is a fact, but he is still a back up.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-15 14:16:57	USA must kill this penalty off.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-19 04:52:22	Watching Titanic on AMC for the millionth time and still can't stop watching...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-19 15:44:25	@PAKFANVikes I don't see the difference between Ponder and Bortles, Not a strong arm but can keep plays alive with legs. Why the hype?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-20 15:55:35	@vikings Speilman to talk with Matt Cassel's agent later today to see where they stand.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-20 15:56:32	Spielman - "We are going to have to address that QB situation...Lots of issues to address as we go through this process...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-20 16:54:15	@Tessab25 USA Gold in Womens Hockey ;)  LOL. Should be a great game can't wait to watch it. #GoUSA
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-14 16:17:34	@TomPelissero Boy it really shows that in the report. The NFL is like a cat, except it has more then 9 lives.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-20 18:29:02	@TonyDeanTHW @pfspot Agreed as long as they can get a veteran UFA QB like Cassel or a McCown.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-23 04:56:57	@FollowThePuck It's time to go back to a private school tourney and a public school tourney. Joke same teams always making the tourney!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-23 05:02:40	@FollowThePuck They are when they recruit players. Don't tell me it doesn't happen.  Need to change. What happen to being loyal to your (1)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-23 05:04:18	community the brought you up?  Doesn't happen anymore.  May as well make it the H.S. Elite Tourney!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-23 05:05:18	@FollowThePuck  Same teams every year now getting OLD!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-23 05:09:23	@FollowThePuck totally agree with u, I know for a fact that Edina recruits no question, However they do to compete with Private schools
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-23 05:11:05	@FollowThePuck either way IMO
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-23 05:38:04	@FollowThePuck @tomsachi we can go on forever.. However the schools with money win. You can't argue that one. My point exactly, what happen?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-23 05:51:01	@FollowThePuck they think that anyway. We can just agree to disagree.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-25 15:27:37	@PAKFANVikes If Bortles falls to the @vikings, I liked Mayock's take on him staring down recievers. Sounds a lot like Ponder to me.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-25 15:29:31	I really like the @mnwild Brodziak but would love to have Steve Ott as a 3rd or 4th line Center.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-25 15:33:04	@PAKFANVikes @Vikings However if he was playing behind Cassel or McCown for a year or two would be perfect.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-25 16:13:52	@canusaSD not going to happen. He wants to win the cup and is not going to do that with the Sabers rebuilding.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-26 05:20:23	@1500ESPNJudd same surprise really!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-27 17:33:14	@DerekWetmore Cassel will be a Texan, he has a history with O'Brien being the N.E. OC ... I wouldn't mind if they brought in Josh McCown.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-27 17:43:32	@DerekWetmore agreed! but sure is fun!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-28 21:03:34	@TomPelissero no suprise there, He can't stay health, but was good when he could.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-28 22:01:47	@ShannaMoakler I didn't want to do it but I got too lonely, I had to call you up in the middle of the night....
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-01 03:23:39	@Russostrib what a joke? Why no replay ?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-26 22:24:31	@Russostrib What does Winchester do for this team?  Do you see anyone else being moved?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-01 03:28:20	Someone from the @mnwild  needs to put Bieksa out of his misery.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-01 03:29:43	@TonyDeanTHW @NHL why no replay?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-01 04:36:54	Should be 2-1 @mnwild....
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-01 05:34:08	@Russostrib looked like they went shoulder to shoulder?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-01 05:50:12	@ChadGraff @WCCORosen  Wild should have won in regulation. Refs hosed them.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-28 04:08:12	@TonyDeanTHW @SportsnetSpec Hall gets what he deserves! The kid could be a stud if he focused more on scoring and back checking.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-28 04:10:48	@TonyDeanTHW  where did you hear that?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-28 04:34:08	@TonyDeanTHW I hear ya, not ready to give up yet way to young. They would rather wait and get Vanek IMO.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-28 04:42:59	@TonyDeanTHW  I love speculation and the trade deadline... NHL is the best one usually out of all pro sports.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-28 05:32:24	@walz3737 love what I saw out of stoner tonight. Stuck up for his mates, reminded me of Willie Mitchell...#loveit
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-28 06:09:47	@TonyDeanTHW @SportsnetSpec @mc79hockey  watch it again RNH butt ended Ballard in the chin 1st...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-28 06:54:47	If I'm the @Vikings I draft the best available player then draft Derek Carr.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-28 08:34:49	@TonyDeanTHW Nice work, I wish I was as good a writer as you are. I played HS Hockey in MN and some JR. Understand the game better then most
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-28 08:37:29	@TonyDeanTHW You can totally see the writer's that have never played the game. No knock to anyone it's just obvious.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-27 02:15:03	@Russostrib I figured, What do you think the Wild would give up for Miller? Murray basically warned the fans they might not like the return.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-27 04:16:18	I have a friend who has been a season ticket holder of @Vikings since it's 1st season and has earned their seats. Now is going to have to(1)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-02 03:42:10	@Russostrib Why wouldn't the Wild make a run at Kesler?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-02-27 04:20:27	to let his tickets go due to the seat licensing prices which are ridiculous. I was in favor of a new stadium but not anymore #feelbad4them
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-03 18:31:14	Is John Tortorella today's Mike Keenan?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-04 15:45:10	@1500ESPNJudd @lChristianson12 @MNState0fHockey I agree with Judd, why give up prospect now when you can get him for nothing over the summer
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-04 16:22:36	@Russostrib  I see what Van is asking for Kelser and the way the draft, wouldn't the #wild be a good fit?  Same age as #11 &amp; #20...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-04 17:42:52	@Sportsnet @Dixononsports  The Wild would also be a great partner.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-04 19:56:04	@Russostrib do you think they will  make anymore moves?  If so any idea's on who they might be looking at?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-04 21:54:06	@PumperNicholl @TSN1050Radio Tortorella is today's Mike Keenan you have worn out your welcome.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-04 03:30:33	@Russostrib can tell Scandella is rusty...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-05 15:01:42	@1500ESPNJudd They need to add a goal scorer.  ie Vanek, Moulson, St Louis...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-05 06:57:55	@walsha he is a lazy player.  Plays when he wants. When he plays like he cares he can be one of@the best.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-05 07:49:35	@Russostrib I would love@Vanek, However I would also love Ales Hemsky.  https://t.co/LEEvJ4ZGdC
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-04 15:08:16	Would the @Vikings have interest in Mark Sanchez if he becomes available? @PAKFANVikes
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-04 18:09:43	SHHHH!!!! Per source the @mnwild are in trade discusions for Halak and Broduer. WOW like everyone didn't know that a few days ago.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-04 18:13:46	Will Jason Zucker be with the @mnwild after the trade deadline?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-06 15:53:04	@1500ESPNJudd  lost Parise and Koivu for some long stretches,any team would go through that if they lost a couple of their star players
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-05 15:51:54	My prediction is @mnwild stay status quo, however I wish they would give Tyler Myers a look. He would solidy the D for years to come.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-05 21:06:00	@Russostrib What happened with Stafford?  Thought he might be on this team as well.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-06 16:00:35	@1500ESPNJudd Plus throw in the Goalie situation they ran into, this team could have really folded, instead they have best record in 2014.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-06 18:52:48	@MnWildGirl ooops forgot about Heater,  He is on the 4th line Heatley-Haula-Fontaine/McCormick....
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-06 15:50:58	@1500ESPNJudd If the Wild were in the east you wouldn't even be talking about Yeo,  He has done a great job when you think about it.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-09 03:56:08	@mnwild bad call
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-09 04:11:09	@LifeInTheSinBin he was tripped into the goalie. Hard to give him grief for that. He was trying to peel off.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-09 04:17:03	@Russostrib horrible play by Ballard bad call by the officials on. Haula.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-10 16:20:42	@1500ESPNJudd @Russostrib @CScarrella  the Wild needed to get bigger and did. It showed last night
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-12 19:37:48	@BleacherReport  C'MON @Vikings go get'm!!!!! We need him in our secondary.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-14 03:03:42	@PAKFANVikes Vox in the box needs to go on the road my friend.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-11 03:31:31	@ErvinSantana_54 I hope you sign with the @Twins we love watching you pitch and would solidify our rotation. We need you.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-14 16:21:06	@Russostrib I like that a lot, Nino has earnd it. Is there any reason Yeo won't put Haula on the 3rd line and move Brodz back?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-11 19:38:48	@GregJennings @uk_vikings I guess GOD is a Vikings fan then.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-13 15:49:12	@mnwild I know Brodz is a great guy, But Haula is a much better player already and should be on the 3rd Line with 24-22 . #hehasearnedit
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-13 16:47:17	@thesuperstar68 @bobsansevere I was listening @105theticket.Thats awesome @Jabs_13.Says alot  about what type of person @MichelleDBeadle is
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-13 17:44:05	Why are the @Vikings dragging their feet on signing a CB?  Last time I looked this was a huge area of need.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-13 17:59:33	@RapSheet wonder if the @Vikings  would be intrested?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-14 19:08:26	@AjKFAN anyword on some potential linebackers or scat back?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-14 20:45:08	@RapSheet @nflnetwork cause he is a worm burner.... hahahaha
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-14 21:14:13	@VikingUpdate @mattbarrows Thank God!!!! I hope we play them.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-14 22:01:10	@CourteneyCox @CVTSoftServe Twist cones are my favorite. YUMMO!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-12 04:20:52	@DarrenWolfson what about Cromartie?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-12 04:24:09	@Russostrib I would put Nino on 2nd line and put Coyle on the 3rd. #struggling
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-13 20:14:30	@TomPelissero do you think the @Vikings will sign a FA CB? If so who?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-12 01:32:54	@SeifertESPN @AdamSchefter BIG loss for the @Vikings here. Really needed him. Plan B
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-12 03:19:40	What a terrible, terrible loss by the @mnwild tonight.  Team not the same since Koivu has been back.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-12 03:22:54	@PaulCharchian now with Talib off the board. Who do the Vikes go after at CB?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-14 02:13:48	@PulledGoalie old time hockey mike...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-14 02:24:31	@PaulCharchian what do you think of Derek Cox?  must be something that Zim likes.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-18 02:08:00	@mnwild I don't understand your line combinations. Why wasn't McCormick in the line up tonight? Bryz needs to get a start.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-18 02:36:06	@plbarnes84 I hear ya, I thought the effort was the tonight he just needs to finish.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-17 13:48:53	Happy St.Patricks's Day Everyone!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-17 15:54:11	@1NatalieMaines That's one hell of a Tea Bag.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-18 02:17:31	@plbarnes84  if nothing else Haula should be moved to the 3rd line. Play a physical team tonight no McCormick c'mon.Koivu did play better..
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-19 19:39:36	@kerinoble1 I bet  the @thesuperstar68 is laughing his arrrs off right now.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-18 20:35:34	@VikingsReport for the right price MJD would be agreat fit here.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-19 14:00:22	@Russostrib Love watching Zuck play, but has a history of being injured often.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-20 14:54:23	@PAKFANVikes what a great interview with @Vikings HC Mike Zimmer. If you missed it check it out on FAN ON DEMAND.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-20 16:13:31	@RapSheet any word if he will visit the @Vikings? He would be a great fit IMO. Could be big as a 3rd Down Back + insurance if AP got hurt.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-24 14:25:55	@PAKFANVikes  REALLY like having Haula on the 3rd line....
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-24 17:35:01	I thought @JonBlum7 had a great game for the @mnwild last night.  #welldonesir
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-27 17:45:18	@Russostrib the @mnwild always force the puck to the net and try to make a play about a foot in front of the net. Wish they would shoot (1)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-27 17:53:43	@Russostrib @mnwild I am all for the garbage goal. But they need to find ways to get better shots from the top of the house not outside it.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-28 00:54:35	@Russostrib all started with ANOTHER Heatley turnover.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-28 16:57:59	@Russostrib Great Article Mike.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-27 17:47:11	@Russostrib @mnwild like Coyle and Nino's goals last night. (2)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-27 04:39:02	@katyperry but dancing to your music does =)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-28 03:05:18	@Russostrib reminds of watching H.S. Hockey where the coach plays his favorites. The teams that win play there best players.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-28 03:50:42	@Russostrib when your PP can't score and your PK can't stop anything, it's a bad combination. = buttes whooped
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-28 00:42:57	Shattenkirk is real tough. Nice cheap shot buddy.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-28 17:15:59	@ProFootballTalk Don' t forget to add the @Vikings to the list.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-03-31 17:24:54	Well let's see if the @mnwild can make this a streak tonight. Usually a pretty physical matchup with LA. GO Wild!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-01 02:33:27	Why does it always feel like the @mnwild is on bad side of the hits. We don't have a guy who can hit like that, hope @thelnino25 is ok.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-01 02:46:35	@JJN1196 @mnwild @thelnino25 @NHLPlayerSafety I agree , but they will say he went through the body.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-01 03:27:11	Spurgeon WTH were you doing out there. Who were you covering AARRRGH!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-01 03:31:12	@mnwild he should be suspended.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-01 03:54:49	I hope so @AnthonyLaPanta  the @mnwild need to get on a streak in the worst way.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-01 03:28:59	Someone from the @mnwild needs to step up and put Muzzin in his place. 2nd head shot tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-04 03:46:04	@mnwildrubes @Bollig87 @NHLShanahan The will make up some reason not to suspend him.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-08 01:22:48	@DerekWetmore @Twins need a change. Gardy and Anderson need to go.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-08 02:50:26	Don't think anyone expected Bryz to be this good, especially the @mnwild . Let's hope they can count on him for a long run in the playoffs.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-08 02:53:28	@Russostrib there's NO DOUBT!!! He has been stellar since coming over.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-09 02:19:20	if the @mnwild would play physical all the time they would win the game. #tosoft
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-09 03:09:28	The @mnwild should be a team to look out for in the playoffs. 7-0-3 since Bryzgolov trade.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-09 14:05:45	I would assume Christian Folin will make his @mnwild debut these last two games, now that they have clinched.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-09 03:06:37	@lou_nanne @plbarnes84  how big has the Bryz pick up now. All I can say is wow. The team looks like they can beat anyone now.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-12 19:10:47	@mlghockey @GopherPuckLive Good Luck tonight coach. Go Gophs!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-10 19:41:30	@RadioFalness @bobsansevere I call UND the WHO!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-10 20:43:39	@Russostrib How do you think Yeo has done as HC this year? I think he has done a great job considering he lost both  #11 &amp; #9 ext. time.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-11 19:59:45	@NHLPlayerSafety Please show me the difference between Rupp's hit on Oshie and then Muzzin's hit on Pomenville. Same exact thing but no (1)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-11 20:00:38	@NHLPlayerSafety suspension or call. You are way to inconsistant with your calls. http://t.co/6Jp9Vyvlz9 via @YouTube
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-11 20:03:17	Please show me the difference between Rupp's hit on Oshie and then Muzzin's hit on Pomenville. Same exact thing but no suspension #whatajoke
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-11 02:39:08	@Russostrib what did you think if the hit@on Oshie? Big debate on NBCSP...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-12 06:01:09	Funny I send a copy of Muzzin hit on Pominville to NHL and no response. What a joke....
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-16 14:25:37	@TwinsPrez % chance the game happens tonight?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-17 16:57:23	Patrick Roy HERE WE COME!!!!!
Wild vs. Avalanche 2003 Game 7 Overtime: http://t.co/XQRAJ6YHva via @YouTube
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-17 20:15:31	@PAkfanvikes  BOOM!!!! 8:30 can't get here fast enough.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-18 04:53:11	@Russostrib Spurgeon cost us IMO! Don't understand why he was on the ice in that situation.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-21 21:27:12	@Russostrib @lou_nanne is this going to be a pay per view event. LOL!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-22 20:09:51	@MinnesotaWiId Bickells hit is actually worse, look at Bickells feet then look at Cooke feet at least 24 was trying to lean into hit Barrie.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-22 21:44:58	@kfraserthecall @RealBBrothers How do you not have a hearing for Bickell and have one for Cooke?  Doesn't make sense. Bickel hit was worse.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-22 21:46:34	@PAkfanvikes NICE!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-22 21:59:08	@MNWILDerness20 @adater like this is any better.  //www.youtube.com/watch?v=35dz2E0f__8
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-22 22:04:02	@MNWILDerness20 @adater Now that is how you can end somones career.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-22 23:45:05	@TheHockeyNews @JKTHN the @mnwild have dominated 2 of the 3 games. They don't need the refs help.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-22 23:45:40	@g_taylor19 @TheHockeyNews @JKTHN 10x worse he gets nothing.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-23 01:21:53	Milbury is such a hypocrite! He says Cooke hit worse then Bickell. #whatajoke
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-22 03:35:08	Gotta love how many people are complaining about Matt Cooke's hit on Barrie! Watch the replay Barrie tries to avoid the hit. (1)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-22 03:36:25	That's what happens when you try and hide. (2)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-22 03:39:12	@HackswithHaggs @NBCSN Milbury should no better then to say anything!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-22 03:43:51	@JesseLamboo and you never played the game at a high level. Watch the hit he led with his shoulder and Barrie tried to duck the other way.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-22 03:44:33	@JesseLamboo not intentional is all I am saying.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-21 13:27:52	@TheVikingAge @mattvensel  I think they want Carr and can get him later as well.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-22 14:29:14	@Russostrib ? for Yeo, why no quality shots from the house. Shots are always from the point or 1' in front of the net trying to jam it in.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-22 15:24:04	@BleacherReport you can see by the picture he leads with his left shoulder and is leaning into him.I know Cookie has a past but this was (1)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-22 15:27:54	@BleacherReport was not intentional. IMO, Watch Bickell hit Sobotka now that was obvious as he stuck his leg out to the left to get him.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-21 16:04:08	I hope the @mnwild line up changes will help them score goals. Because they won't be very physical tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-24 02:07:36	@Russostrib  will Cooke appeal?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-24 03:01:16	Sorry 7 gms is way to long for @mnwild Cooke susp. How does Bickell not even get a call. NHL is a joke. No consistency!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-24 05:17:53	@1500ESPN_Reusse @GopherPuckLive I am assuming Mike  Antonavich was there
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-27 04:41:02	The @nhl refs for tonight's @mnwild game game should be fired. Plain and simple! Nice job Bettman!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-27 04:42:41	@MinnyPuckPanda has nothing to do with Yeo he is a great coach.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-27 05:23:20	@Russostrib how many players get away with pushing a ref. WTH he should be suspended.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-24 13:40:48	@Russostrib Do you think 7 games is to long? What do you think would have been the right amount of games?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-24 14:03:12	@Russostrib I am nervous about the @mnwild to stay physical tonight. I would of put Veilleux in Cooke spot and left Nino where he was.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-24 14:05:25	Iam nervous about the @mnwild chance to stay physical tonight. I would of put Veilleux in Cooke spot and left Nino where he was sit Heater.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-27 12:45:34	The @mnwild missed Veilleux last night.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-24 17:50:30	@walz3737 are suprised that the @mnwild aren't playing Veilleux istead of Heatley tonignt? Who is going to pick up the physical play tonight
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-28 13:38:22	@Russostrib @adater Wild vs. Avalanche - Game 5 NHL Fan Department of Ref...: http://t.co/IqCWb0DF1e via @YouTube  True Facts, Just Sayin.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-28 14:14:07	@stevemit30 who was behind them?  They were the only two racing for the puck. Please tell me you are a referee!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-28 14:55:28	@Russostrib @PAkfanvikes @KFAN1003 Loved watching you and @adater last night with @WCCORosen. #goodstuff
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-28 15:44:28	@PAkfanvikes it's a big difference when the goalie is pulled.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-27 19:37:53	@TonyDeanTHW @LifeInTheSinBin  what most people don't realize is with an empty net, that should have been an automatic goal.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-27 19:42:12	@TonyDeanTHW @LifeInTheSinBin exactly. Still shocked a pro ref misses that. They were the only 2 guys at the puck.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-27 19:45:18	@TonyDeanTHW @LifeInTheSinBin totally agree with that.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-28 16:48:50	@stevemit30 That is not the rule. http://t.co/hy0pDUCOFy
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-28 17:28:28	@stevemit30 are you reading the Local Association Rule Book.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-30 15:48:45	@Russostrib same line up tonight?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-28 05:11:05	@blakeshelton you mean Pepsi Clear. Now that's old school.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-28 05:23:32	@stevemit30 @9modano @Russostrib @mnwild could care less about the off sides. The obvious hold with no goalie is an automatic goal!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-29 01:55:42	Shortys are game changers. How is there no one letting Suter know the penalty was over.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-30 18:05:10	@GoMinnyWild I think it would have been for Heatley, but he has played better the last 2 games and can be used on the PP. IMO
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-30 18:11:59	@GoMinnyWild I hear ya, But Heater has been the last 2 games. Don't get me wrong. When Cooke comes back Fontaine will be in and Heater out.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-29 04:38:33	@Mikey6665545 @stevemit30 Amen Mike, I know what all the rules are, I played the game for 21 years of my life. I agree with JR.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-29 04:39:59	@JJN1196  I guess
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-30 21:03:53	Velliux will play for Fontaine tonight. The @mnwild must be physical but discipline tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-04-30 21:33:15	@AnthonyLaPanta  The key for the @mnwild tonight, they must stay away from 4 on 4 situations as much as possible but stay physical.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-01 03:35:23	@Russostrib nothing better!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-04 19:20:55	What a terrible version of the national anthem IMO!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-02 17:15:57	@walz3737 said it best, the @mnwild have taken on the Parise never quit attitude. Go Gettem Boys!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-01 05:19:53	I remember Yeo saying in training camp what  surprised  him the most in training camp. How heavy @thelnino25 shot was.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-01 05:23:18	@adater now that I know you better and understand you. You are hilarious.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-01 05:47:39	@PAkfanvikes don't be crabby tomorrow.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-01 05:49:56	@PAkfanvikes I need me some Hall and Oates. You make my dreams come true.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-05 13:33:50	@plbarnes84 @Russostrib @wiggij3 Our big guns started off the last series the same way. Need Cooke back in the line up. Really miss his PK.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-05 14:02:22	@DarrenWolfson @ArifHasanNFL I think Barr upside is huge. Look what he has done since moving from FB to LB in just 2 yrs. #couldbeastud
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-05 14:29:22	@Russostrib @SouhanStrib It's the way they try to score that is the problem,always with in 2' of Crawford. Trying to jam it home. (1)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-05 14:31:54	@Russostrib @SouhanStrib (2) They need to shoot out further like the McCormick goal and the one Crawford got lucky on Parise.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-05 18:35:06	@AnthonyLaPanta Stoner has been playing his best hockey as a Wild player these playoffs.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-04 19:29:14	I hope someone knocks Leddy into next year. After the elbow to Heatley's head last game.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-04 20:54:27	@Russostrib we need some puck luck in the worst way...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-06 20:11:25	@PaulCharchian I really like Anthony Barr considering he has only been a LB for 2 years,his upside is huge. IMO
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-06 14:08:31	@KFAN1003 Hell with finishing your checks, Their big guns need to start finishing.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-08 21:10:45	@105theticket I hope not. I think he is injury prone. I would rather have Barr or Johnny Football
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-07 18:25:14	@TonyDeanTHW BryzWallov was very good again. He is not getting enough credit IMO.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-07 18:29:26	@TonyDeanTHW Agreed, I have been saying all year. Haula is the most underated player on the Wild team.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-07 19:12:52	@GuyFieri Welcome to Triple G,  Guy Gets Grillin' now thats a show for ya
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-10 06:16:18	@Russostrib what's the word on Ballard? Dirty hit by Bollig in my opinion. Could have slowed down big time before the hit.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-10 01:36:31	What channel is the game on Direct TV?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-12 21:45:55	@AdrianneCurry I'll take a soda with a slice of lemon. #westcoastproblems
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-13 19:26:25	@PAkfanvikes @KFAN1003 That would be so freaking awesome!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-15 14:48:19	@teddyb_h2o Welcome to the @Vikings Touchdown Teddy!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-16 14:13:17	@TonyDeanTHW @TSNBobMcKenzie @Russostrib They won't be out of work for long. Washington should hire them both. Now that would be fun to see.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-16 14:51:12	@TonyDeanTHW @TSNBobMcKenzie @Russostrib I agree a mess but still  would be fun to see. Imagine the look on PIT Brass if it happened.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-20 19:45:10	It's official, the 2018 Super Bowl will be in Minneapolis!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-21 14:26:49	@Russostrib Will the @mnwild have any interest in FA Paul Stastny? I think he would be a better fit then Vanek.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-23 13:39:18	@TheHockeyNews @Proteautype ABSOLUTELY should be suspended for that hit. These are the type of hits that need to leave the game.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-23 18:49:45	@SNHockeyCentral Brad May should be on the same list as Bertuzzi when it comes to sucker punches. Dirty, Dirty player.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-05-23 19:22:40	@GuyFieri @guyfierivegas My Wife and I will be in Flavor town Oct. 14-18. We will check it out.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-06-17 17:43:05	@MinnesotaWildMN Jack Dougherty will be a stud in the NHL. He is skilled and is also tough.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-06-25 19:42:13	@PaulyWalnuts26 would be a great fit  4 the @mnwild style of play/team. He is the right age for a good mix of vets and youth #StanleyCup
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-06-26 04:09:29	@Russostrib I would rather have Stastny he would be a perfect fit in @mnwild uniform. We have guys like Frolin and Dumba coming in as Def.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-06-26 13:33:59	@thoen88 @Russostrib I really don't think it would matter who plays the 3rd spot. But I would assume it would be Koivu. Brodz is a goner.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-06-26 13:39:18	@thoen88 If you think you are a cup contender you will. that would be a huge advantage for the Wild or maybe trade bait at the deadline.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-06-26 13:44:20	@thoen88 I agree, but I would rather have Stastny then Koivu personally.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-06-26 14:18:34	@thoen88 I guess the fun part is we can all speculate. But GM CF is a smart man and knows what it takes to get better.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-06-24 17:51:28	I think the @mnwild would be getting a Scott Stevens type D if they were to draft local boy Jack Dougherty. Kid has potential to be stud.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-06-25 14:47:58	I believe the @mnwild will be more active in FA this year rather then making trades at the @2014NHLDraft .
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-06-25 14:59:46	I would draft @AdrianPeterson  number one overall in my FF Draft. I think he can break the all time all purpose yards record in this OFF.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-01 14:12:53	I wish the @mnwild would just go after Stastny and Mtichell and be done.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-01 16:43:03	with Stoner gone the @mnwild must sign either Mitchell or Orpik in my opinion.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-01 17:17:56	Have a bad feeling about the @mnwild  chances of  landing a top UFA.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-01 17:30:36	After seeing the moves in the west @mnwild will need to sign at least 3 Top UFA or they take a step back IMO.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-01 17:44:01	Vanek signs 3 year deal with @mnwild per @HockeyyInsiderr
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-01 18:11:38	Really going to miss Cody McCormack. @mnwild must find a replacement.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-01 19:33:31	The @mnwild definitely got weaker today. #loststonerandmccomack
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-01 20:35:33	@Mikey6665545 @mnwild losing Stoner and McCormick are  a big loss. The team has no toughness now.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-06-30 18:21:32	@KatieStrangESPN Makes you think Stastny is a goner.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-06-30 20:32:23	@Russostrib when its all said in done, what UFA's do the @mnwild end up with?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-03 05:35:08	@TonyDeanTHW Tony I agree, I always like making conversation when I can. Let's face it we have to be real, but we can still have our opinion
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-02 16:36:08	I wish the @mnwild would make a run at @otterN9NE I think he would be a great fit in MN and would be a nice replacement for McCormack.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-02 17:38:03	@BMileskiKFAN @KFAN1003 @Russostrib What about @otterN9NE as a possible replacement for McCormack
.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-02 19:40:32	@Russostrib I hope so, he has history with Pomenville and Vanek.  He would be a great fit.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-02 19:44:19	I sure hope the rumor is true @otterN9NE might be coming to MN. I would feel sorry for the opposing team. Cooke and Ott. great PK..
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-02 20:14:21	@Twins PLEASE cut ties with Correia!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-07 16:57:36	My Thoughts &amp; Prayers go out to Ottawa Senators General Manager and President of Hockey Operations Bryan Murray.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-09 13:21:34	@HockeyMom_Jody  Absolutely and back atcha!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-09 17:25:54	@DarrenDreger I wonder if this makes Patrick Sharp expendable?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-09 19:22:52	@MeatSauce1 @BMileskiKFAN Fiestada all the way, Okay Daddy!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-11 20:36:08	@TonyDeanTHW How was Folin today?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-10 14:37:26	@jprutherford @Russostrib He would have looked good in a @mnwild uniform.  I would much rather have him then Brodziak and his 3 mil. per. yr
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-10 15:11:16	@Russostrib True,  I like Brodz, I just think he is not worth the 3 mil. I hope he takes on a true 4th line roll that McCormick left behind.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-10 20:50:50	@TonyDeanTHW I think Folin can take the place of Stoner, although he may not be as tough, he can hit and shoot the lights out of the puck
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-10 20:57:25	@TonyDeanTHW He is filled out too, 6'3 220 pounds.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-10 21:04:58	@TonyDeanTHW I think people had the idea that was just another Casey Wellman signing much different. IMO.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-10 21:22:37	@Mancini1979 @TonyDeanTHW he was a late bloomer,always had potential but didn't really fill out until the last 2 years in college.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-15 04:20:42	@TonyDeanTHW @Gaber_29 NICE!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-15 16:16:21	@AjKFAN Why didn't it work out in Oakland then? HMMM..I think each  person has a right to their religous beliefs. either way 2 big egos.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-15 16:47:07	@martinamcbride The Everly Brothers Cathy's Clown .
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-14 21:11:39	@ColbieCaillat  every women should see this video. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Amazing video. I will show this to my Daughters.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-24 04:17:37	Just watched @jimmyfallon  and @RealRobinWright  laughed my butt off.   Jimmy and Robin rocked it tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-22 17:38:53	@TheKnollApts  Twins, Saints, Loons and Dukes.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-22 19:46:18	@TheKnollApts DANG!!! I thought the Millers were gone in 1960.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-24 04:32:08	I must say @RealRobinWright is AMAZING!  Have always enjoyed her work all the way back to her day time show Santa Barbara. # welldone
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-24 04:34:42	Yep I'm old and sexy😜.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-27 16:44:57	@AccessVikings  that's why Felton will stick around 1 less hit A.P.  has to take.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-29 17:19:28	@TonyDeanHB @thoen88 @SOTSOHockey I can Fontaine being trade bait for a Defenseman.  Especially if he starts off hot again.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-29 17:25:17	@thoen88 @TonyDeanHB @SOTSOHockey I don't think they would be looking for a top 4, It would be someone to replace Stoner # dropthemits
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-29 18:01:28	@TonyDeanHB @SOTSOHockey @thoen88 Problem is every great team has a Defensemen like a Stoner / Willie  Mitchell type.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-31 15:35:07	Very nice trade by the @Twins today.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-07-31 20:18:48	@Twins this is a real roster. 3 AL MVPs (Verlander, Cabrera x2) and last 3 AL Cy Young winners (Price, Verlander, Scherzer) on SAME roster.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-08-24 05:04:23	@GregJennings not picking on anyone person, but it's nice to watch a team that is well coached. #youguyslookgreat
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-08-27 16:40:22	@PAOnTheMic  Can you ask him about Folin?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-08-27 18:25:19	Is Josh Gordon the next Chris Carter?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-08-27 18:27:09	Is Josh Gordon the next Cris Carter?

263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-09-12 19:15:53	It's finally Friday! I'm free again, got my motor running for a wild weekend.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-09-12 19:46:16	@RobSchneider WOW!  How many kids does Tom have?  How much protection does he need.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-09-12 20:00:26	@KFAN1003 He could be?  We will have to wait and see how he finishes his career.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-09-17 13:27:12	This is why I am an @NHL fan.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-09-17 14:20:05	@VikingsReport  The @Radisson can blow it out their REAR, They tried ripping me of and I will not stay there anymore.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-09-18 15:57:28	@PAOnTheMic AMEN PA!  I have been taking heat for saying that all over the office this week and I have never personally met AP.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-09-18 16:00:11	@PAOnTheMic  what if I said I would never purchase a Target,Radisson or Nike product again if one of there employes had dine somting illegal
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-09-17 16:44:05	@murphPPress @bobsansevere  It's pretty obvious that southern black men have a totally different outlook on this situation.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-09-17 20:20:06	I am going to ask @Target @Nike  @Radisson if they have any employees that have done anything illegal? if so I will not purchase ur product
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-09-30 15:14:44	@NHLonNBCSports He has progressed every year and looks the part, Folin just doesn't have it yet, but will get time as the yr goes on.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-09-29 20:31:34	@AjKFAN The Pohlads still have to open up the check book if they want the fans to come back. Not all Gardy's fault.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-09-30 20:46:13	@MeatSauce1 @JoeBringMN will watch you in 2 weeks @WCCORosen, Congrats Sauce.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-09-30 21:54:33	No Surprise, NFL Blackouts lifted by FCC.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-10-03 00:24:52	@mnwildLIVE is the game on any live stream?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-10-03 19:10:33	@ColbieCaillat what are they feeding you?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-10-10 16:53:19	@FSNGorg  The @mnwild  looked like champs last night. Let's hope they can sustain it for the whole year.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-10-17 05:01:16	Going to see the @zacbrownband for our 20th anniversary at MGM in Las Vegas  all the way from MN.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-10-19 06:30:05	I just watched DVR of the @mnwild Ducks game. I hope somebody rips Keslers head off next game. #ducksrdirty.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-10-28 01:12:56	The @mnwild are getting out muscled the last half of this game. The @NYRangers are dirty.  No excuse to play that way.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-10-28 01:14:32	The @mnwild  REALLY miss a guy like Stoner tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-10-27 13:40:16	@JoeBringMN He knows Norvs offense but a 2nd Rd pick is to high. He would really upgrade our receiving core that's for sure.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-10-28 14:48:11	@TSNBobMcKenzie  they want to eliminate fighting in the NHL. Its because of hits like that &amp; the one on Haula that u need guys like J.Scott
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-10-28 14:49:53	@TSNBobMcKenzie The @mnwild didn't have a player in there line up to protect them and this is what happens.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-10-28 21:31:11	@TonyDeanHB @jeffdubay The MNWild got man handled last night . They REALLY missed a guy like Stoner with his size and physical presence
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-10-28 21:45:06	@TonyDeanHB @jeffdubay  YES! The future for sure. It was so obvious that there was no enforcer in the line-up last night.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-10-29 15:48:16	@blakeshelton Neked, HAHAHAHA you bastard. Gettin paid to be durnk neked.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-10-29 21:22:54	@Sportsnet That should be a minimum ,  He should be out as long as Haula is out. Then these career ending hits will stop.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-10-29 21:25:05	@RobSchneider are you with Gerge Michael? Do you have to give for what you take?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-11-07 03:09:23	@Russostrib The Wild lack a punishing defenseman like Stoner Big Time.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-11-07 16:07:20	The @mnwild really miss Stoner! The just aren't finishing there checks like they did last year. When teams get physical with us we lay down.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-11-18 14:50:37	@KFAN1003  I am just done with @NFL period!!! The rich get dummer!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-11-18 14:54:58	@KFAN1003 @nfl  You employ a bunch of thugs,  what do you expect. Anything to make a buck or billions. #NFLISAJOKE!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-11-15 20:39:46	@Russostrib they need to continue the physical play. Good mix in the lineup today.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-11-19 17:45:11	Watch the  @NFL  and you get the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus show!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-11-19 21:33:27	@mattvensel I called that, I think he could fit in quite well in this offense. At least hey have a veteran back now.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-11-20 20:41:54	@NHLonNBCSports He would be a perfect fit with the young 'D' @mnwild  has. He brings toughness, skill and leadership with him.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-11-20 21:37:07	@JLnomeland @NHLonNBCSports @mnwild I know everything has a price, but he would make this team a legit contender.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-11-20 21:47:17	@JLnomeland @mnwild Could you imagine every other shift you get Suter then Phanuef. Top 4 D would be Suter, Scandella, Panuef and Spurge.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-11-20 15:19:03	@Kimwilliamspais Picked mine up from confirmation class last night in mine, great minds think alike.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-11-20 21:52:05	@JLnomeland @mnwild for sure! But that all starts on the back end.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-06 01:34:50	The @mnwild are not big or tuff enough to win the cup.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-06 02:26:51	Boy what a difference when the @mnwild start standing up for each other.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-06 05:55:36	Getzlaf against Spurgeon really! @mnwild must get more physical and skilled defesively! Hmmm Phanuef!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-08 18:38:59	The @Twins Pitching staff is an ACE away from being good. Every team needs an ACE Pitcher,a feared power hitter and a stud CF.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-10 15:11:31	The @mnwild really miss Matt Cooke! They need a player that can lay the lumber and finish checks.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-10 16:20:23	@TonyDeanHB @T_Vanek26 @EHaula I always liked that line.  They seem to have chemistry right off the bat.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-10 19:17:43	@DarrenWolfson He would be a great addition. Now let's see if the Twins can land him.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-10 21:03:36	@Russostrib  He leaves his feet when he checks him, doesn't matter if he turns or not,  Martin hit him high and left feet left the ice. #BAD
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-10 21:09:05	How Martin doesn't get suspended is beyond me. The @NHL  should be ashamed. He left the ice surface to make the charge in my opinion. (1)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-10 21:11:49	@NHL wants to get rid of fighting, when the real reason people get hurt are from hits to the head like the one Ballard took last night. (2)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-10 21:14:40	Not only did Martin charge Ballard his skates left the ice surface to hit him  Doesn't matter if he turned or not http://t.co/Pjs2246nCJ (3)
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-10 03:07:12	When is CF of @mnwild  going to get a clue and get tougher. The @mnwild are week but skilled. Guess we know who won.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-10 17:54:18	@TonyDeanHB @T_Vanek26 They really miss Cooke's PK and physical play . He and @EHaula  are a great PK.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-15 22:46:37	@RWitherspoon I have not yet but plan to, however I did watch one of my all time favorites, Just like Heaven again with my kids.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-17 03:15:45	@TonyDeanHB the @mnwild D are not physical enough on their forwards. They must start laying the lumber.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-17 05:45:41	The @mnwild D need to start pounding other teams forwards in our zone. There is no price to pay when they are in our zone.  MAKE THEM PAY!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-18 03:44:08	Don't understand why you go the front of the net and cover no one!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-18 15:32:49	@MinWildshow They miss a tough mean Defensemen like Stoner was. The @mnwild D are not physical enough with there checking on opp. frwds.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-19 13:56:24	@God_Loved I know this is cliché, but some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-21 03:14:14	The @mnwild D are to soft. They played their best hockey when they had Cooke, McCormick and Stoner. Not enough grit on this team.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-21 04:11:34	The @mnwild need a change. They need a leader with more passion. I love Mikko but he should give the C to Parise.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-21 04:13:52	The @mnwild get out muscled all over the rink. Knocked around not mean enough.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-21 04:21:30	@dumbMNsportsguy @TaylorWildfan25 Goaltending is not the problem. The wild don't play mean enough. They lack team toughness.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2014-12-22 17:31:30	@NHLonNBCSports That's only part of it.  They lack team toughness. They are not physical enough in their game. They need a touch of nasty!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-02 18:27:38	The @mnwild  dont have any team chemistry, but have a lot of talent &amp; lack team toughness, looks like a team that don't support one another.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-02 18:28:59	The @mnwild must make their playoff run now.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-07 18:15:27	@Russostrib What's the latest word on Granny?  I think the @mnwild  are just to young Defensively and in the Net.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-08 16:22:49	My thoughts and prayers go out to Zach Parise and his family on the passing of J.P. All my best.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-09 17:14:11	@TonyDeanHB That's because they know they are on the hot seat. The biggest mistake made this year was not landing an above avg vet D'Man.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-09 17:16:07	@TonyDeanHB  Never was a Backstrom or Harding Fan either. Love Kuemper but he is to young. Should of kept Bryz or went after Marty.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-09 17:25:36	@TonyDeanHB @MinnyPuckPanda Agreed! The you can't expect much when you have such a young D core and a goalie as young as Kemps"
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-13 16:12:44	Take the "C" from Mikko &amp; get a D or a goalie. Maybe that will send a message to spark the @mnwild. If it fails Yeo is gone either way IMO.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-14 17:06:54	Would you give up Granlund and Brodin for Kessel and Phanuef?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-14 17:11:32	@JW1929 I am not sure they would,  Every team is always after up and coming talent. But the Wild need to win now.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-14 17:12:16	@JW1929 But it would never happen cuz the salaries don't match up.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-15 02:52:01	@TonyDeanHB  AMEN!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-15 02:55:49	@NHL_Updates  you suspend Suter, but a guy runs all the way across the ice and shatters the face of our player and nothing.  #prettyweek
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-16 05:28:23	I know it was Buffalo and Suter was out, but it was the best D play we have add so far this year!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-16 05:30:10	@TonyDeanHB I know it was Buffalo and Suter was out, but that was the best D play  we've had so far this year.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-16 05:32:27	@TonyDeanHB And as I've said Dubnyk was on terrible teams, but  here he could be a decent goalie. Nice spark tonight
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-16 06:08:03	@RWitherspoon took my wife to see Wild tonight for her B-Day! She loved it. Amazing Work!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-14 22:14:24	@garik16 @TonyDeanHB He has played on some pretty bad teams with a pretty decent sv% .918. I'll take it and he is only 28yrs old.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-15 05:25:16	@Sportsnet what a joke! NYI player runs across the ice and sends our player into convulsions and no suspension! F'ing joke.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-16 14:49:07	@Russostrib I know it's Buffalo, but that was the best defensive showing by our D group all year IMO. Great gap control and Physical.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-16 16:23:32	@AccessVikings I hope so! I think he has learned his lesson.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-16 18:34:08	@TonyDeanHB Agreed
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-16 19:30:22	@Trembleyemtp @FSGonePuckWild I agree, Said the same thing yesterday.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-18 04:48:20	The @mnwild were very lucky to win tonight.  Way to go into your shell and quit controlling the play. BRUTAL!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-20 16:39:45	The @mnwild are in a tough spot, but they must rattle off a 8 or 9 game win streak to get back into this. All you have to do is get in!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-22 16:47:13	I really wish there was a way the @mnwild could trade for @DionPhaneuf_3.  We need a "D" Man like him BIG time.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-28 17:48:09	Any hockey player out there knows how difficult this is. Coyle scores breakaway from behind net: http://t.co/MXsJ4ZcWuP via @YouTube
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-30 04:22:02	HUGE save by Duby Duby Doo!!! #mightbesaveofthegane
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-28 22:16:21	@PAOnTheMic @Russostrib @Tbyrnes2 I am here so I don't get fined!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-01-30 20:01:28	@AdamSchefter His name should be DUMB MODE!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-03 17:30:23	@Russostrib Will they make a move to replace him? That is a HUGE loss.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-03 18:38:15	@walz3737 Really going to miss Cooke though. They need to find a replacement. They have really missed his physical play this year.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-03 18:40:23	@walz3737 Would Ryan Malone fit that role?  He is on waivers.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-03 20:21:13	@FoodNetwork  Creamy Limburger Cheese!! limburger cheese and onion sandwich was my Grandfathers favorite.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-03 21:46:14	@FSGonePuckWild  EX-Penguin too.  Yeo is familiar and vice versa.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-04 16:51:31	@Russostrib Loved how physical Brodin and Suter were last night.  MAN did they frustrate the Hawks FWDs  last night. Finally led by example.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-04 05:11:46	@Russostrib  he looks like a more experienced Kuemper! IMO!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-04 05:14:41	@thoen88 all you need to do is get in!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-04 19:17:58	@hockeynight FINELY!!!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-04 15:01:20	What will the @mnwild be at the trade deadline? I say buyers.  But if the team played that physical every night they will be tough to beat.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-04 15:19:42	That was the most physical I have seen the @mnwild play as a team. They were all over the Hawks last night.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-05 15:32:13	@patmick2626 @Russostrib Is there anyway the @mnwild would make a run at Phanuef ?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-05 15:46:03	@markdrustad13 Always love it when @Russostrib  fills on the @KFAN1003
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-05 16:28:40	@NHLJets are thought to be seriously shopping Evander Kane.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-05 20:19:35	@FSGonePuckWild Depends on the exchange rate.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-06 19:01:19	@RWitherspoon KC and the Sunshine Band
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-08 02:36:01	Love the physical play of the @mnwild the last 8 games. #makingadifference
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-08 15:35:47	@TonyDeanHB team def and physical play has been huge. Back to playing as team and not individuals IMO. Oh and DUBY has been amazing.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-09 17:05:41	Devan Dubnyk named NHL's 1st star of the week!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-09 17:53:16	@Russostrib @JCraw4991  That line has been very good.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-09 03:07:41	@PAOnTheMic never miss a Vox in the box!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-09 03:08:17	@PAOnTheMic or the sounds of hockey.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-10 01:14:51	Would someone please drop Burrows, he is such a hack.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-10 01:37:04	I am a little worried about Zucker!  The @mnwild need him.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-11 15:33:04	The @mnwild may have to add a Top 6 FWD if they are going to make a run.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-11 02:35:57	That was a lazy play by Suter!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-10 05:17:28	Another HUGE win by my team @mnwild  tonight!  Let's keep it rolling against the @NHLJets tomorrow night.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-10 05:35:00	@Russostrib I am assuming collar bone and shoulder.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-10 05:37:10	@Russostrib I could see them putting Shroeder in for Zucker and Graovak in for Carter.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-11 03:19:56	Way to finish your check Parise! Made that goal happen.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-11 22:23:40	Should the @mnwild  go after @PKessel81 now that they have lost Zucker for the year?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-11 03:53:25	@RussosFilter not a fan, he is just to small.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-12 21:26:13	@Sportsnet  I wouldn't count out the @mnwild . They do have assets they can move.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-13 01:22:21	The Granlund , Vavek, Schroeder line looks real good.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-13 02:40:10	The @mnwild starting to look like the team they were before the win streak. Not finishing checks etc...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-11 15:16:45	@BleacherReport Kanye is a very disrespectful human being.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-11 17:02:11	The @NHLJets  just got a whole lot better.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-11 17:42:12	@Rupper17 @NHLJets  just go a whole lot better in my opinion.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-11 18:01:25	@FSGonePuckWild  Agreed!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-13 14:56:15	Would Antoine Vermette be a good fit for the @mnwild ?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-15 02:42:04	When the @mnwild "D" play physical (finishing checks) they win.  Go back and look at the game against Hawks. Suter &amp; Brodin led the way.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-15 03:29:48	Sorry to be a Debbie Downer but the @mnwild "D" are pathetic tonight in front of Duby. How many guys are they going to let screen him.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-17 03:22:44	Really really like the 22-3-10 line. Have looked strong since being together. Go @mnwild!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-17 04:35:56	The @mnwild have lost their touch of nasty,  same ol take it up rear when teams get physical. CMON finish your checks.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-17 04:37:11	@TonyDeanHB  when teams get physical with the @mnwild  they lay down.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-17 04:57:33	The @mnwild are afraid to get hit.  If they want to win they must start dictating the play.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-17 05:27:24	@Russostrib they miss some toughness right now. McCormick and Stoner set the tone for a lot of games last year. @mnwild lack it this year.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-17 05:36:39	@TonyDeanHB  that was brutal! They lack toughness IMO! They don't have that checking line like they had last year with McCormick IMO.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-17 05:50:04	@Russostrib  gotta love some of these clowns Russo.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-19 04:04:04	MAN do I miss Stoner. I'm sorry Mr.Yeo but if we don't start protecting Duby he is going to get hurt.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-19 04:09:21	@TonyDeanHB  is it just me or does this team need to start protecting Duby?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-19 05:01:44	@Russostrib what are the hit stats for the game after regulation?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-19 05:36:43	Thanks @Russostrib I appreciate it.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-19 05:39:08	@EskomoKisses @MinnyPuckPanda taking a play from Gardenhire is he😜
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-19 05:43:37	@Russostrib do you see the @mnwild making a move before the trade deadline?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-19 06:18:34	Koivu makes great back check and gets the game winner tonight. Great to see.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-23 03:08:38	Nice play by Folin!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-23 03:22:33	Not a lot of Coyle and Schroeder tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-23 03:23:04	That a boy Steph!!!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-23 03:25:16	@FSGonePuckWild  what a nice play!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-23 03:35:35	@TonyDeanHB Dumba has been brilliant and obviously deserves to stay. IMO
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-23 03:40:11	6 goals on 15 shots by the @mnwild who was losing 1-0 after 2
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-23 03:50:28	Everyone was calling for Yeo's head a month ago. Was it really his fault?  I never thought it was him at all.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-23 03:51:48	@PAOnTheMic @Jeremy_Roenick @NBCSN AMEN to that PA.  Just said that very thing to my wife.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-23 04:07:20	@RussosFilter he should at least get #1 star.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-25 04:29:52	@thoen88 I am concerned the @mnwild lack killer instinct. We will find out what they are made of Thursday night.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-26 18:19:50	I see Bergenheim as guy that will put a hurt on the other teams star players if they touch one of ours.  He can hit and forecheck well.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-26 18:21:41	@Russostrib  would you say Bergenheim is a good mix of Fonzy &amp; Cooke.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-26 21:06:39	The @mnwild  can redeem themselves tonight with a win against the Preds!  LET'S GO WILD! LET'S GO WILD! LET'S GO WILD!#Becauseitstheplayoffs
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-26 21:26:02	I wish there was a way the @mnwild could land Phanuef. They need a Dman that can get in the craw of opposing team best player + he's skilled
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-27 01:22:01	@walz3737 I hope they play with an edge to them, always seem to play better when they do.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-27 01:50:35	When the @mnwild get out hit they lose, plain and simple, look at the stats.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-27 02:04:30	@mnwild must get better scoring chances.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-25 14:47:02	@thoen88 Agreed, Scrivens stood on his head the last 2 per. I think with the addition of Bergenheim  and sounds like poss Vermette.will help
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-27 02:19:57	Now the @mnwild are playing physical! BOOM! When we dictate play we are dangerous!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-27 02:56:35	WOW! What a play by the @mnwild !!! BOOM!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-27 03:07:04	@AnthonyLaPanta  Haula looks like a different player against playoff teams
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-27 03:52:33	Wild look good! But we need another!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-25 15:08:25	I know everyones mad the @mnwild  lost to the Oil, but I mean c'mon how many times in a row are you going to beat someone. They'll be fine.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-25 15:11:46	I really hope rumor is true that @mnwild are looking at trading for Vermette. MUST be solid up the middle if you want to win in the playoffs
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-27 04:02:03	@FSGonePuckWild  gotta shoot the puck there. Worst case a rebound goal.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-27 04:04:00	@PAOnTheMic @mattvensel @AccessVikings I love AP he made a BIG mistake! But cmon already move on. I hope he stays here. #playwithachip
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-27 04:09:13	BOOM!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-27 04:13:01	@walz3737 BIG GAME by the boys tonight. They dictated play for most of the night.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-27 04:23:32	@1500ESPNJudd BIG confidence booster tonight!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-25 17:18:18	@SportsCenter I am going to go out on a limb and say he ends up in Denver...
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-25 17:35:04	@mnwild  Love the Make-A-Wish foundation.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-02-25 15:58:30	@MinnyPuckPanda @thoen88 I think they will go after a scoring winger not a center. IMO.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-01 03:42:07	Is it just me or are they cheering for DUUUUUB!!!😆
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-01 04:57:00	@Team_STL @MinnyPuckPanda  not for long!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-01 05:01:22	@TonyDeanHB I agree a better wing player with his shot.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-03 04:06:38	@Cstew_80  WELCOME to the state of hockey.  I hope it all works out for you and the @mnwild. Would love to have you here for years to come.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-01 13:26:10	@myNHLTradeRumor Maple Leafs have no power, they have plates that don't want to be there. Who is going to give up all that.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-01 13:40:22	@myNHLTradeRumor @ChuckNewton9 I hear Ya just not at their asking price. Way to high in my opinion.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-01 13:44:01	@myNHLTradeRumor darn auto correct. I meant players not plates.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-01 13:45:35	@myNHLTradeRumor this should be an interesting next 2 days. Looking fwd to it.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-01 05:48:55	Patrick Roy should be ashamed! Classless @Avalanche!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-01 05:53:16	@Russostrib I hope so. Nice reaction to Bergenheim hit on McKinnon. Roy and McLeod should be suspended!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-01 06:12:47	Roy and McLeod should get suspended for that BS!  Super Classy!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-01 06:51:38	I am VERY proud of Coyle tonight for sticking up for his teammate against a thug like McLeod. Takes BALLS!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-02 16:36:19	@Russostrib You are such a tease to all these RUBES!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-02 16:44:59	@NHLexpertpicks The price will continue to go down on Dion and Phil.  The LEAF's are in rebuild mode and the vet's don't want to be there.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-02 16:46:15	@TonyDeanHB  Totally Agree!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-02 18:22:14	How enjoyable will it be for the @MapleLeafs  fans watching  hockey the rest of the year.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-02 19:33:20	@TonyDeanHB I would be surprised if the @mnwild  make it past the first round. They lack a big "D"... A Dink so to speak.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-02 19:48:49	@thoen88 They still lack a hard hitting Defensemen.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-02 20:51:25	@gilesferrell @EskomoKisses  If the Yeo can get him to buy in he can be huge asset, He is a great replacement for Cooke who I think is done
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-02 20:54:20	@EskomoKisses @gilesferrell It depends on who is playing the best. He can be a BIG asset to the PP. We could have used him last Sat.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-02 20:55:08	All I know is I went to lunch and came back with Stew and Leo!   BOOM!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-02 20:57:30	If Yeo can get Stewart to buy into the system. He can be a STUD for the player they need him to be.   Nice job GMCF!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-02 21:07:04	@EskomoKisses @gilesferrell Depends who is playing the worst of the Bottom Six in my opinion.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-02 21:19:15	@myNHLTradeRumor Great job again this year!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-02 21:45:37	@walz3737 Love it,  I think Stewart was a sneaky good pick up. If he buys in to playing Defense he can be a force.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-02 21:52:27	@Mattkrebsbach21 @Russostrib Change of scenery good for both players more than likely.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-03 18:29:26	@Real_ESPNLeBrun Agree 100%!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-01 14:01:53	@myNHLTradeRumor agreed!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-04 15:48:17	@FSNGorg I remember it like yesterday!!! This is why WE ARE THE STATE OF HOCKEY!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-03 15:21:47	@Russostrib Sunday is going to be INTENSE! I just hope know one gets hurt.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-03 19:03:55	@Vikings Suh would make the @Vikings Defense one of the best in the league.!  Could definitely make up for some of the weakness at LB.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-03 20:48:32	@Russostrib What a BUM!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-03 16:11:18	@carrieunderwood those look like hockey player hands. Congrats!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-03 17:30:12	@sn_nhl What about Roy?  I thought that there were rules in place that the coach gets fined too?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-04 21:05:51	@Kmclaughlin19 @MaryOski Sunday is going to be fun!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-04 21:08:43	@Russostrib Thank you for the coffee!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-06 21:18:53	@ChadGraff Roy is an idiot! He should go back to juniors. That's where he should be coaching.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-04 02:15:47	The @mnwild just got tougher in a hurry. Last time we played this team, they knocked all over the ice.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-04 02:43:13	@Russostrib agreed!  They need to just be simple not fancy.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-04 03:49:59	BIG BIG game by the @mnwild Matt Dumba tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-04 03:52:13	@Russostrib BIG game for Matt Dumba tonight. The kid is taking the next step.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-04 04:14:38	@Russostrib I thought Leo played well considering he was a little rusty, but that was to be expected I thought.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-10 06:01:28	@Sportsnet @reporterchris should have cleaned house at the trade deadline. Did anyone really expect anything else.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-11 01:08:04	Matt Dumba has turned the corner. WOW!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-11 02:55:10	@Russostrib I think he is having fun here.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-15 01:14:33	BOOM!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-15 01:18:56	OKAY now BOOM!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-15 01:41:14	If the @mnwild don't start playing more physical, they will lose. Getting pushed around and chasing way to much.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-15 01:43:33	@Russostrib they are getting out played and out muscled. BIG TIME!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-15 01:45:02	I love Suter, but he is way to soft.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-15 02:28:37	That's what I call a BOOM!!! BOOM!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-15 02:46:58	BIG win by the @mnwild tonight. First win in @StLouisBlues since 07.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-18 02:31:51	What a dominating 3rd period by the @mnwild.  What a big point on the road in Nashville.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-18 02:52:35	@patmick2626 @plbarnes84 @PAOnTheMic it must of been the sounds of hockey ringing@in someone's head. HMMMMMM!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-18 03:03:51	How good is the future for the @mnwild  "D" core. Dumba, Brodin, Folin, Spurgeon. WOW!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-18 03:07:12	@ @mnwild great call @thoen88, totally slipped my mind. I personally think Spurgeon night be the odd man out.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-18 03:10:39	@thoen88 @mnwild I totally agree!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-18 03:11:30	@thoen88 @mnwild Super fun to be a @mnwild fan right now.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-18 03:14:41	@thoen88 @Mikey6665545 I agree with that as well. Biggest concern is Scandella stay healthy. He has had at least 2 concussions already.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-18 03:20:03	@thoen88 @Mikey6665545 agreed! I hope we can sign Stewart to a reasonable deal for a few years.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-18 15:05:47	@Russostrib That 3rd period last night had to be one of the most dominating periods of the year.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-17 17:57:52	@ESPN_NHL Kadri can say whatever he wants, but he has a long history of these types of hits. He is a GOON just not with his fists.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-18 20:24:01	@Russostrib @BMileskiKFAN The future @mnwild "D" core is pretty impressive. Not sure there is another team out there with this much talent.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-24 23:33:59	The @mnwild must get more physical if they want to get into this game.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-24 23:40:49	The @mnwild look like a team just trying not to get hurt tonight. They must start dictating play.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-29 01:22:50	Muzzin is a cheap shot artist.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-29 02:37:49	Really liking @Cstew_80 game. I hope resigns with the @mnwild. He gives this team a boost that you don't always see in the score book.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-31 20:57:46	@patmick2626 I like Lucia but I think his message is starting to fade.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-03-31 21:13:57	@patmick2626 I agree with that to an extent, but he still has to get the most out of his players and I didn't see that this year. IMO
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-02 17:12:36	@TheHockeyNews @THNKenCampbell He should never lace them up again! Does not respect the game,
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-05 01:03:45	@thoen88 Suter has been awful in front of Duby! He plays way to much in my opinion. I love his game but not great defensively.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-05 01:06:59	@Russostrib Suter has been brutal in D-Zone. He must become more of a dink in front of DUBY.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-05 01:41:11	The @mnwild get out muscled tonight. No edge to their game.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-05 01:53:58	The whole @mnwild team must play more like Parise! When they play with an edge they WIN!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-08 01:57:29	@thoen88 shoot to score! It's like they live for the redirect instead of the rebound.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-08 01:59:29	The @mnwild PP is so bad. Shoot to score for God sake.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-08 02:38:53	FINALLY!!!! Let's go @mnwild !!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-08 03:22:45	@lou_nanne is it just me or does the PP seem like there not shooting to score rather always looking for redirects instead. Seems simple 2 me
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-08 03:27:19	Congrats to the @mnwild on clinching a playoff spot. Yeo did a great job.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-08 03:29:09	@lou_nanne agree with you on that one. Really In my opinion only mistake he has made was Leddy.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-07 00:23:11	What do the @mnwild have to do to get a call?  These refs are a joke!!!!😡
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-07 00:32:03	Maybe Yeo should go Schoenfeld on the REFS
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-07 00:34:05	@hockeylogic @dakota_case maybe Yeo should go Schoenfeld on the bit. HAHAHA
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-07 01:32:52	The @mnwild D are way to soft.  IMO.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-07 01:34:42	The @mnwild do not look like the more desperate team. Jets taking it to them. Much better scoring chances for the Jets.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-07 02:10:51	Where was the hold on Parise!  Seriously!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-07 02:48:14	Jets earned it. Plain and simple.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-07 15:29:26	It's really pretty simple for the @mnwild. If they dictate the play they win. If they don't like last night they will lose.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-07 19:39:20	@AnthonyLaPanta I still say it's an easy fix for the @mnwild. When we dictate play we win. When we pressure the opponent we win!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-13 14:05:04	@Russostrib There were two teams I didn't want to face in Rd.1. The Blues and Jets.  They seem to knock us around and put us on our heels.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-14 16:08:59	@Russostrib He's just taking the sails off so he can play faster. HAHAHA
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-16 04:21:46	I love the @NHL playoffs!  BOOM!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-17 01:54:16	ZUCKER!!!  I hope someone lays out Reaves!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-17 02:16:24	I love Suter's game tonight. When he plays physical the rest of the group follows.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-17 02:55:50	Why wasn't that interference on Ott?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-17 03:15:46	That a boy @thelnino22! Don't let that Shatt do that Shatt to you!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-17 04:10:21	@PAOnTheMic @PaulCharchian are you going to start the show with.. This is how we do it bay bay!!!!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-17 04:21:56	@johnkriesel @RadioFalness are you for real?  I hope we sweep
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-17 04:36:17	@Cstew_80 I hope you re-sign with us! You changed the game tonight. You are the player we have been looking for the last 3yrs.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-17 04:40:37	Oh yea! @PKSubban1 is a punk. Tuck your tail and run type of player. Dirty! Dirty! Dirty! Disrespecting the game IMO!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-17 04:41:38	@Russostrib watch their bench after he scores. Everyone puts their head down. Hilarious!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-17 04:44:12	@plbarnes84 what knuckle head!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-17 13:38:23	@Russostrib  Bergenhiem had a sneaky good game last night.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-18 20:55:22	The @mnwild can win if they start dictating play! C'MON boys!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-18 21:56:00	The @mnwild still come home with home ice advantages once they won game 1.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-17 20:38:38	@CraigCustance Draft Lottery are a joke.  They do not help any team in a league that uses them.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-23 03:38:00	@AnthonyLaPanta @mrokern not Dubnyks fault. POOR,POOR effort on the part of the @mnwild. Needed to make adjustments and haven't.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-23 03:49:12	I see a @mnwild team that quit tonight. Lost the race and every battle tonight. It is now @StLouisBlues series to lose.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-23 03:52:33	Gotta give it to the @StLouisBlues they won the neutral zone battle tonight. Lots of turnovers by the @mnwild tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-23 04:11:47	@AnthonyLaPanta they must win Friday in my opinion!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-23 04:13:58	@1500ESPNJudd it was ugly, St.Louis won the neutral zone battle from the get go. Way to many turn overs by the D tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-23 15:50:46	@TheVikingAge Not Surprised,  same offense and coaching staff he had in GB
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-04-30 14:52:30	BIG day for the @Vikings today!!!! What will they do with the 11th pick tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-05-01 14:48:27	@RapSheet I think they showed their commitment when they signed to the large contract. All he has to do is honor it.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-05-01 15:16:09	LET'S GO @mnwild !!!!  LET'S GO @mnwild !!!! LET'S GO @mnwild !!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-05-06 14:59:23	It was a nice run!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-05-07 15:01:46	Well it's DO or DIE tonight for the @mnwild , I am hoping for a miracle.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-05-08 04:41:30	Say what you want but the @mnwild need a new "C" to take charge!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-05-07 23:56:38	The @mnwild forwards must pound the Hawks D &amp; dictate play if they want to win tonight.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-05-12 16:13:31	To me Peter Rose is no different then A-Rod, Roger Clemens or Barry Bonds.  They all cheated the game to make money PERIOD!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-05-13 18:13:50	The Boogey Man! Will always be a hero in Minnesota!  https://t.co/N0nZygY7IC
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-05-15 16:37:33	@fsnorth @KFAN1003 @PAOnTheMic @PaulCharchian  What is his take on not standing or being on the field for the National Anthem?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-05-14 19:28:04	What a game last night by the Rangers and Caps!  Leave to a MN boy to score the game winner. Nice job Stepan!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-05-19 15:35:54	@CraigJButton @collegehockey  I agree, but everyone also said the same thing about Dean Blais when he left ND as well.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-05-19 15:37:59	@DerekWetmore @JessRMyers the logo should be a ? and call themselves the whouix!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-05-21 13:33:40	With Babcock in the picture now, will the Leafs continue their rebuild or keep Kessel and Phanuef?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-06-03 16:32:22	@PAOnTheMic BREAKING: #AmericanPharoah has drawn post position number 5 #TripleCrown @BelmontStakes
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-06-09 14:24:14	What will the @mnwild do on draft day this year?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-06-09 16:13:58	@gbphoenixmsoc  Do you know when the 2015-2016 schedule be coming out?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-06-11 20:49:11	@MinnesotaWildMN I am a fan of Mikko but you don't know that.
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-06-12 21:37:11	@Russostrib I concur!  Happy B-Day!!!
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-06-11 19:20:54	If M. Rielly were to sign with @mnwild, it would give them so many options on draft day. Please sign with the Wild. You will make us better
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-06-12 13:44:07	I really hope Mike Rielly signs with the @mnwild !
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-06-18 19:11:03	@Russostrib  I'm excited for the 2015 Draft.  Do you see the @mnwild being interested in a guy like Kessel if he is available?
263281958	ChuckNewton9	2015-06-18 19:14:47	@DerekWetmore He has looked great this season. If the guy could stay healthy he is an above avg. pitcher.
