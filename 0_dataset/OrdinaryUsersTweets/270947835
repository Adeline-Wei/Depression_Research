270947835	justinpenguin	2012-11-09 14:34:06	@JKKS_5 If you put him in the competition this season, he's never gonna reach near 3rd place
270947835	justinpenguin	2012-11-09 14:35:20	@lynniezle I like him too! But his singing cannot be compared to Melanie or most of the singers this season!
270947835	justinpenguin	2012-11-09 14:41:07	@lynniezle yeah his style!!! After his album was released, he did not gain much recognition either!

270947835	justinpenguin	2015-05-01 09:22:34	There was nothing much to laugh about really 😐 https://t.co/jHBMk0ltso
270947835	justinpenguin	2015-05-02 04:10:06	@kellybombz ouch!
270947835	justinpenguin	2015-05-02 05:32:09	@jojog98 @JieYi_ woah woah 2 weeks of sch already got ppl ec you
270947835	justinpenguin	2015-05-02 05:41:00	@JieYi_ @jojog98 Jieyi must you keep killing my self esteem? 😢
270947835	justinpenguin	2015-05-02 05:44:51	@jojog98 @JieYi_ lol who so bored until play your askfm? I think is real la! Look around in lecture for eyes on you 👀
270947835	justinpenguin	2015-05-02 05:58:44	@jeshuakoh same!
270947835	justinpenguin	2015-05-02 06:26:32	@jojog98 @JieYi_ wah then she/HE has to look back for you 😉
270947835	justinpenguin	2015-05-02 06:26:48	@jeshuakoh you never know what can happen!
270947835	justinpenguin	2015-05-02 15:12:22	Again Sterling you don't deserve that much money if you play like Torres at Chelsea
270947835	justinpenguin	2015-05-02 15:23:18	Lambert plays so much better than Balotelli! Wins the header, good passing, good ball retention and works hard. He just doesn't have flair
270947835	justinpenguin	2015-05-02 15:31:56	If we don't win, I blame sterling
270947835	justinpenguin	2015-05-02 14:32:23	Sterling looks like he forgot how to dribble! Doesn't look $50m to me
270947835	justinpenguin	2015-05-02 17:17:13	David Beckham gets 2.3m insta followers in 12h! Wow

270947835	justinpenguin	2015-05-03 04:52:58	The scorecards weren't even close? Bias American judges
270947835	justinpenguin	2015-05-03 04:54:07	This is the reason why this is my first and last boxing match I'm watching...now to the real shit UFC
