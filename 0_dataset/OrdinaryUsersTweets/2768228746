2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2014-09-14 02:16:27	Yesterday I woke up and my brother and his friend were playing monopoly,speaking English accents, and wearing top hats. #what
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2014-09-14 06:11:19	So I might actually do the talent show this year. It'd be awful and I'd be extremely nervous by I may still try
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2014-09-14 06:16:03	@julieesmiles haha I'd look so dumb but that would actually probably help! 👍

2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2014-09-17 00:45:04	@julieesmiles don't say that 😳 that's scary 😱
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2014-09-17 00:48:28	@julieesmiles yeah but it's sad when you say it like that 😮
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2014-09-18 22:38:37	I was going to ask someone to homecoming but I can barely speak to her without getting ridiculously nervous so if I asked her id die 😲
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2014-09-19 00:16:41	Why are these the top stories?? 😆 http://t.co/zup6fV4B4D
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2014-09-20 00:54:02	I don't think I'll be able to ask the girl I want to homecoming. Too nervous 😔
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2014-09-20 02:20:35	Don't tell me that I'll be fine. I'm so sick of hoping you're right. #neckdeep

2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2014-10-12 00:36:56	Well all the people having fun at homecoming are missing the blue jackets game. So that's my excuse for not going.
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2014-10-12 16:29:40	If I put the new songs that I'm writing on YouTube would anybody watch them?
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2014-10-13 00:55:18	I am like the male version of Meg griffin 😞

2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-01-15 01:06:45	I'm so excited for college 😄
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-01-15 01:10:36	@arwluv I still haven't heard from osu so I'm not sure 😖 if not osu it'll be OU!
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-01-15 18:34:56	I've had nothing but negative things to say about myself for the past year so I'm going say something nice about myself for a change 😃
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-01-15 18:35:59	I think I'm a pretty nice person. I go out of my way and try my hardest to make other people happy no matter how I feel. Go me.

2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-01-19 20:38:21	@julieesmiles that is the funniest way to say something sad I've ever heard :(
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-01-19 22:52:51	Well that went about as well as I thought it would. It's a shame but o well not like it matters!
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-01-20 03:28:11	@toriwelsh_3 you're a dork 😜
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-01-20 20:26:05	Putting a swear word In a presentation and pretending it was an accident was far and away the most rebellious thing I've done in high school

2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-01 22:02:24	I had a dream that I got accepted to Ohio state. And then I woke up and checked and of course I still haven't heard 😑 I just want to know.
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-03 00:09:59	I just worked out for the first time in a long time. I don't know how you fit people do it.
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-07 02:32:32	@BurgandySage seriously like one of their best games this season 😑
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-07 01:16:31	Hating @BurgandySage for being at the blue jackets game 😑
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-08 01:57:13	If you've got the keys then start the car and drive as far as you can. Ahhh I love this band too much. Issues better be at warped tour!
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-09 23:41:43	@BurgandySage seriously!?!? Come on!!! Not fair!!
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-10 12:55:38	I want to see the spongebob movie. But I have no one to go with. Looks like I'm going to another movie alone! At least it's cheaper 😁
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-18 14:05:46	@TrevorCarroll75 yes. You bastard.
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-18 14:06:06	I'm so glad I've finally started writing songs again. 😁
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-21 07:10:50	I really need someone that will go to the warped tour with me.
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-22 04:01:10	Ruttiger is my best friend for sure. http://t.co/G18dQZxmYV
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-24 01:34:01	I was so excited to come in late on Friday! Then I found out I have to come in early for ap gov 😑
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-24 01:48:05	@HannahMack12 oh I didn't know that! That's not too bad then!
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-25 02:51:41	Well In a few months youll never see me again. So I'm not going to go out of my way to be nice to someone who couldn't care less about me. 😒
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-27 01:24:15	Ok call off the best goal of the entire season. That's cool 😒
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-25 02:30:18	I feel like I'm finally getting back on track. I'm sorry I've been so down and mean to everyone 😔
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-02-28 18:50:58	@BurgandySage i was hoping he'd start 😔
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-03-01 01:45:29	@BurgandySage at least I finally saw a fight! 😆
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-03-03 23:01:37	Ugh it gets lonely having no one to talk to. 😔
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-03-10 23:21:07	I knew I would try as hard this year but wow. Even I'm surprised how little I care about school 😆
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-03-13 00:43:31	It's been such a long time since I've been sick 😷 at least I get to just lay around all day! 😁
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-03-19 00:44:21	I'm pretty sure I've heard every punk band in existence by now 😆
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-04-03 13:50:52	I'm still not sure if I'll ask someone to prom or spare myself the embarrassment of getting rejected😆
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-04-04 22:00:49	HAT TRICK!!! http://t.co/lEVgHSeJcS

2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-04-08 18:51:37	That awkward moment when you think your project was funny and creative but it turns out it sucked. @BigHMichael
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-04-11 12:48:45	So I'm definitely going to go to a prom so if there's a group that needs one more and trusts that I won't ruin everything let me know!
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-04-12 00:41:54	@alli_brooke2 ugh but I don't like you.. Or Sarah... 😒 I'm totally kidding! Thank you that's very kind of you! 😀
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-04-14 19:11:47	@BurgandySage @LVSeniorTag2015 on the way to get a squirt gun I should add. I was defenseless. 😆
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-04-14 20:55:56	@britt_brittyy oh thank you!! That's very nice of you!
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-04-23 14:02:53	@badguymobile finally someone else listens to issues! Haha
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-04-22 23:50:55	I'm officially a Bobcat 😀😎👍🎊
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-04-23 01:18:04	@Twade217 @C0DYKETTER both really good arguments. It's going to be a tough decision.
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-05-01 16:29:03	Ohio University Athens to study engineering! 😎 #LVDecisionDay
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-05-05 10:54:21	Forever wanting this to be my senior picture. Yeah that's me upside down in the air. 😆 http://t.co/NXywXBeAQ5

2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-05-13 02:05:23	I am so excited for this summer 😀 almost here!
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-05-13 13:13:07	2 days until rock on the range! This will be the year a break my neck moshing or crowd surfing 😆
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-05-16 05:32:05	I really wish I could stop being such a loner. 😔 so sick of feeling so worthless that I don't want to make others put up with me 😞
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-05-15 12:56:21	Slipknot shirt or beartooth shirt? #RockOnTheRange http://t.co/4mYhlZ4S1o
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-05-17 00:53:36	The pit for Devil Wears Prada was probably the craziest I've ever been in 😳
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-05-17 01:15:32	Definitely my favorite moment of rock on the range was pushing the drunk guy who was bothering this girl to the ground 😎😂
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-05-17 13:35:13	One of my new favorites! 😎 http://t.co/Xnd6wKdj5k
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-05-18 04:11:49	Still can't believe my friend and I started a huge mosh pit. 😎 😂
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-05-21 01:36:57	I'm pretty upset that there is not a Pizza Hut within walking distance of OU 😐😆
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-05-29 19:55:06	If I threw a big pool party later in the summer would anyone be interested in coming?
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-05-31 19:47:13	Congratulations everyone!! 😎😀🎓🎊🎉
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-06-02 22:26:20	My lack of confidence is pretty alarming 😕
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-06-01 04:23:17	I wish I had someone I could talk to 😔
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-06-03 23:53:09	I have my orientation at OU tomorrow and Friday! 😄
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-06-09 00:11:01	Ugh someday I will actually be able to do something fun 😔
2768228746	jeremyhasissues	2015-06-17 01:56:42	It's June 16th and I still haven't been able to swim in my pool 😑😳
