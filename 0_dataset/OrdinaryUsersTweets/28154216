28154216	aprilicus	2013-08-13 07:49:19	Education during the day, making money at night, donating my time to charity on weekends. I've never been this happy. Night folks
28154216	aprilicus	2013-08-13 07:53:55	Also, dropped by St. Patrick's and got my prayer on today. Asking for stuff? No, SAYING THANK YOU for stuff? You bet.

28154216	aprilicus	2013-08-13 17:41:40	@LillyKathleen89 I didn't bike there yesterday. I just went for a little mini ride around Yosemite. I will let you know though!

28154216	aprilicus	2013-08-17 17:51:43	@_loovekat this tweet reminded me of the song "Love Her Madly" by The Doors.
28154216	aprilicus	2013-08-14 05:33:19	One quality that should never be underestimated and should always be revered is that of an individual who simply never gives up hope.
28154216	aprilicus	2013-08-14 05:43:14	@ShellObama thanks Chimelle! Did you see my Tweet about transferring?!
28154216	aprilicus	2013-08-14 05:43:56	Cool, my throat hurts. I do not have time to be sick right now.

28154216	aprilicus	2013-08-20 17:21:01	Drake told MTV that "Hold On We're Goin Home" is meant to be a "timeless record that people can play at their weddings in 10 years." #love

28154216	aprilicus	2013-08-21 16:16:32	@BetterxDayss babies' belly buttons are disgusting. The term "belly button" is cute as shit, though.
28154216	aprilicus	2013-08-21 16:18:13	Walking to Target instead of driving. Why? Because it's a beautiful day. Because I have limbs that work. And to save gas money. #holla
