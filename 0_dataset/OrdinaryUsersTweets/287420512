287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-13 10:07:54	Maybe we've all outgrown all the things that we once loved.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-13 13:50:09	Why do you do me like this when you kiss me like that lol @ThatNickaNick @BNASSSSTY #nohomo

287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-19 21:13:46	You're the new revolution, the angst filled adolescent. You fit the stereotype well.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-20 18:51:01	Finally a warmer day in Las Vegas!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-17 00:47:18	Duke, quit embarrassing me please.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-17 01:31:12	So pissed at Duke I'm not going to class at all next week.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-17 03:19:26	“@BNASSSSTY: Heard levels on the way home already missing my pbros @jordenvinger @ThatNickaNick” I'm missin all you guys too!

287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-21 04:50:23	@KellySchnippel Uhh no plans currently. Fremont street though maybe.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-21 21:00:28	Are we all victims of opportunity?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-17 15:04:29	It's funny how I don't get to sleep in on the first day of spring break, however I had no problem waking up because it's Vegas time!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-17 15:49:32	@soeth17 You don't want a horse.. We have 8 of them. Pain in the ass.. (don't tell my mom I said that.)
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-22 00:17:38	Who keeps the specials sign up when it ended two hours ago? Miller's Alehouse does!

287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-18 21:12:26	Give me the beat boys and free my soul, I wanna get lost in the rock and roll and drift away.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-19 13:17:39	Had a good night with my twin and a couple beautiful ladies.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-19 17:56:36	Welcome to Denver, Peyton.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-20 03:17:27	And the night begins haha
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-21 01:37:51	@leannb_q7 Haha I just butt tweeted you.. didn't know that was possible! How have you been?

287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-21 03:55:01	@leannb_q7 I can't believe you're having finals, I'm just on spring break!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-21 04:51:38	100 ounces of 190 Octane? I think yes. http://t.co/OMjhD3YT
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-21 05:21:04	Just lost twenty dollars to a four foot tall Elvis.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-23 18:49:07	Well last night was an adventure.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-23 21:45:15	Headed to the pool at the Hard Rock with @khoaa and @Christina_Romeo
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-23 21:57:50	Sad to see @AustinRivers25 leave Duke early, wish he'd stick it out another couple years. It'd be sweet to see him play SG for Doc.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-24 23:21:37	@KellySchnippel whoa slow down now.. you did see me! haha
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-24 23:23:18	Good day chillin at the MGM pools with my big, my uncle, and other UNLV Lambda Chi's. Back to the biggest little city now. #Reno

287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-25 04:04:47	Thank God for P90X.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-25 06:29:41	He knows I tweeted that by the way.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-26 04:18:45	Fruity Pebbles and Physics homework.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-27 06:26:14	I'd like to take the time now to wish myself a Happy 21st Birthday!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-27 06:54:02	@Leexxie You bet I'll RT an Eminem quote!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-27 07:00:47	@Leexxie I miss the Barage.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-27 07:04:35	@Leexxie I would love to, but I'm not sure when I'll be able to.  The next time I get back might be next Thanksgiving :(
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-24 23:26:35	@KellySchnippel I was talking about my Thursday night being an adventure. I was with my big the rest of the week so I couldn't go to Ryan's
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-25 05:20:34	New 59fifty? Yep.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-25 06:27:41	I think Spencer's illness keeps getting trapped in his beard hair and that's why he can't heal up. #sickbeardbro
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-25 18:45:45	Guy beside me at McDonalds pulls out his wallet to pay and a condom falls out. He looks at me and says "That's awkward." #thatisawkward
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-25 23:53:06	@ThatNickaNick @BNASSSSTY No Final Four for the TarSquirrels
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-27 06:55:43	@Leexxie How do you know so much about my life?!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-28 06:55:05	@nicollestewart1 just compared me to Jacob from Twilight. I'm flattered!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-28 06:58:15	@leannb_q7 I would have retweeted this if I could!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-28 08:04:34	Staying up an extra hour to argue about if it's okay for paramedics to find your emergency contacts and let them know what's wrong? Check.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-28 08:19:34	Making out on the Ski bus.. #middleschoolmemories
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-29 22:17:32	@E_2TRILL Hey Ronnie says you're comin to Reno soon I forgot to get my 2k in Vegas. Could you bring it up?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-29 07:19:09	So buying today the clerk at 7-11 asks why I'm shaking. I say because I'm still shaky from my pre-workout. Valid excuse? Ask my twelve pack.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-31 00:20:08	I loved you, and I should have said it, but tell me just what has it ever meant.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-30 02:47:34	"When I drink by myself, I prefer to drink alone." The wise words of Spencer Crowell.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-30 05:48:43	Class bonding #Loyalty http://t.co/9CQy9kO5
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-31 08:58:54	Reno.. #ClubWurk is awesome.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-31 22:47:23	Softball game was fun today but man.. The weather reminded me of Montana baseball in the spring.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-31 02:09:00	Is that what you're wearing?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-01 03:00:51	How do I manage to lose my shirt?  Woke up this morning, and the shirt I was wearing over the undershirt is here, but not the undershirt.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-01 03:22:51	Excited to see another Self vs Calipari championship game Monday night. Should be a great game!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-03-31 19:16:05	I probably looked pretty weird carrying my dress clothes and my baseball mitt.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-01 06:51:19	It's been a long day.. Turning in for the night with the iPod on a #blink182 playlist.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-03 21:31:51	@tony_castaneda No it says "Feelin Lucky" but it's a St. Louis Cardinals shirt.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-03 21:35:06	I'm screwed.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-04 01:41:46	It's one of them "Slim Shady on repeat" days.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-04 08:52:50	We've all been sorry, we've all been hurt. But how we survive is what makes us who we are.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-01 21:58:03	Some girl at the gym was wearing the ΛXA Watermelon Bust shirt. As was I. #ohhellno
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-01 22:42:22	MLB starts Wednesday.  Can't wait to watch my Cardinals start 2012 off right.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-02 05:09:19	Glass bottle of Starbucks frappuccino down.  Seven sections of Calc 2 to go.  Big test tomorrow.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-02 06:00:01	When I think about you.. I think about 17.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-02 18:40:40	Just had a Hangover (movie) moment. Lost my shirt the other night, found clue (laundry card) in a strange place.. Shirt in laundry room?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-05 00:28:19	Well finally something good.. Hopefully STL can pull off the opening day victory. #BaseballSeason
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-02 22:48:58	This next hour decides my fate.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-03 07:48:55	The good intentions that you had, now only came to this. And although she saw the mark, the arrow missed.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-03 07:50:37	And I believe we've found my shirt.. Rumor has it that it's in @tony_castaneda's room.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-05 06:26:31	@nicollestewart1 Do you think about me, when you think about seventeen?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-05 19:41:41	Can I please just play a round of golf and drink beer with some buddies?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-05 21:16:21	My voice was made for the 80's.. Hair nation &gt;
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-06 06:52:27	The best compliment I've ever gotten. "You're the coolest thing to come out of Montana since Moose Drool."
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-09 03:00:30	This past week had its ups and downs, and I'm glad it's about over.  I'm ready for this new week!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-09 09:13:53	@BNASSSSTY the other night. http://t.co/tGTQHyFF
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-07 17:27:52	Dude.. Your light looks like a boob.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-07 20:26:56	I brought down the sky for you and all you did was shrug.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-10 03:36:20	Don't tell me that it's over, I'm not used to this temptation.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-10 08:57:12	Finally got my shirt back. Damn I missed that thing. Good night with my brothers.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-10 09:17:12	The first conquest of Spring '12. http://t.co/FwZABT62
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-10 22:04:27	I hate waiting until the last minute to do homework, but it's my only option with so many things going on.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-18 07:25:28	@ThatNickaNick I see what you did there..
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-18 08:15:28	@soeth17 @thatnickanick It's similar to my favorite movie. The Never-ending Story.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-18 09:37:58	I've got some friends, some that I hardly know. But we've had some times I wouldn't trade for the world.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-11 05:22:27	Serenading sorority girls.. TFM.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-11 06:24:41	Watching Animal House.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-13 11:21:48	Holy. Spent way too much tonight but I had a ton of fun!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-13 11:26:34	Take me drunk I'm home? http://t.co/VpBujK75
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-14 07:14:10	All nighter with my pledge brothers.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-14 10:26:21	This is starting to come out really nice.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-14 12:36:31	Feeling accomplished. Good night.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-18 22:39:21	Finally took the charcoal on charcoal suit to the dry cleaners. #gonnalookfly
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-12 07:18:02	Been fueling up on cocaine and whiskey.. Wish I had a Reno girl to miss me.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-19 22:48:25	Girls tanning on the storage bins outside of Canada Hall. #lol
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-16 04:12:24	Is this the life that you lead, or the life that's led for you?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-16 04:16:03	I'm not after fame and fortune.. I'm after you.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-19 23:53:44	It's golfing weather.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-20 03:14:16	I appreciate good grammar in a text message.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-12 19:59:01	I hate when I have rocks in my Sperrys.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-16 21:07:16	Time to play catch up.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-17 03:15:13	My Physics Professor is hazing because Google can't even help me with my homework.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-17 09:36:55	Another night at the House.. Played a little 2K. Solid.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-20 20:53:18	I don't wear sunglasses because the sun is so bright. I wear them because my future is so bright.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-20 21:51:16	@EddyDayal Thank you.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-21 05:42:40	Life keeps on surprising me.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-21 06:52:27	I just got serenaded lol
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-17 15:55:02	Let's take this one day at a time, I'll hold your hand if you hold mine.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-17 19:18:15	Is it bad if the only reason I keep going to a class is because of the possibility of a quiz? If there isn't one, I leave.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-22 08:29:02	Taking it all in.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-17 22:00:46	Got thrown a curveball by my Dad yesterday.  Turns out I may be jobless this summer.  Summer semester in Reno? Probably.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-22 18:56:43	I'm loving this weather.. And breakfast pizza in the DC earlier started the day off right.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-22 20:01:41	Getting some much needed sun.. #whiteMontanaboy
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-22 21:30:35	@morganogden The roof is on fire. You have no idea!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-23 01:51:06	I feel so blessed to finally be a brother of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-23 19:34:40	Two words. Aloe Vera.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-24 04:38:06	@BKWMT I think there's a big lake or something in that area. I don't know though I haven't lived in Montana for years!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-24 04:38:45	This old guitar taught me how to score.. Right there on that Lambda Chi porch.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-28 20:59:02	Turned a triple play in softball today.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-28 21:00:53	First time eating at Bully's Sports Bar. Place is chill.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-29 07:35:11	21 Jump Street not as funny as American Reunion. Definitely had some memorable quotes though!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-29 10:31:53	Had an hour long argument with one of my best friends about NFL kickers being able to win games or not. Cross that one off the bucket list.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-29 19:16:59	I can't remember the last time I was clean shaven. It feels so weird.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-29 20:34:40	Leave it to me to destroy a pair of headphones by throwing them in with my laundry.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-30 01:11:32	The grind for finals is beginning.. I'm officially a library rat.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-30 03:47:12	Don't you love when water comes out fast when you're washing your hands and it splashes on your shorts and looks like you pissed yourself?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-30 04:44:05	I write motivational titles on my "To Do Lists" such as "Shit To Do." It helps me get the stuff done.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-30 06:54:49	Man I don't know where the time goes, but it sure goes fast.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-25 21:01:16	Girl I can hardly wait.. To get a little mud on the tires.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-25 21:39:42	We raced the sunset and we almost won.. We slammed the brakes but the wheels went on.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-26 02:29:40	Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-26 02:48:28	That was literally the most brutal Ab Ripper X workout ever.. What is the DC doing to me?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-01 03:47:37	@breedendauw Good to know! Haha
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-03 23:03:01	How do you try in a class that won't even count now that you've changed majors officially?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-04 04:22:47	Did you lose yourself somewhere out there? Did you get to be a star? And don't it make you sad to know that life is more than who we are?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-04 06:40:48	Goo Goo Dolls station on Pandora.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-26 23:45:05	What can I even say about last night? My first Wine Wednesday as a Lambda Chi was an experience that's for sure.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-18 07:19:39	Have you ever been a part of something that you thought would never end? And then of course it did.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-03 07:38:39	Don't waste your time on me your already the voice inside my head.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-03 08:04:16	Now the lines are drawn. Is this feeling gone? The best parts of this have come and gone.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-01 19:47:06	Sometimes a guy just needs a burger and fries.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-27 05:43:25	I turned off the car, ran through the yard back to your front door..
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-05 21:53:28	Finally out playing some golf!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-02 03:06:41	What a great gym session.. Now I see why everyone takes pre-workout.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-02 03:32:15	I know a little bit about a lot of things.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-02 04:40:39	@EddyDayal You beat @ryan_eylar. We never played Juan on Juan. We were teammates.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-02 05:28:42	@EddyDayal @ryan_eylar Eddy you're in high school. When you can party four nights a week, call us. You drink less than a toddler in diapers.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-02 05:30:33	@EddyDayal @ryan_eylar Drinking from your mom's breast?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-07 00:50:32	@Leexxie you tweet about listening to Taylor Swift for days and follow it with a tweet with lyrics from The Band Perry. Make up your mind!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-07 07:43:42	I'm gonna try to train myself to read through texts before sending them. Autocorrect gets me every time.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-07 22:10:27	I'm not impressed with my academic performance this semester.  Next semester I've gotta step up my game.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-08 00:37:50	Looks like I'm gonna be living in at Lambda Chi next semester!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-02 22:15:28	You lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window.  Guess that's why they call it "window pane."
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-03 00:33:17	“@caitlinhumenik: if you've never seen Remember The Titans then you are NOT American!” I'm watching it now!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-03 01:21:35	Family dinner tonight with @khoaa and @soeth17! I'm excited for a good time and some bomb Mexican food.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-04 09:10:30	Sometimes late at night, I see your picture by the dashboard lights.. And it takes me, where I'd like to be.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-09 06:46:42	You don't know me. You don't even care.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-11 04:04:01	Corkscroo with @soeth17. Whiskey shot, PBR, double fireball on the rocks, onto the frat castle, then the Wal #Finals
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-11 04:11:15	Having Jimmy Johns deliver to the Corkscroo. TFM.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-28 00:10:23	Welcome to The Show, Bryce Harper. Strasburg on the mound as well I've never wanted to watch a Nationals game more in my life.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-28 00:17:56	New stereo in my truck.. It's nice #nothavingastock stereo.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-04-28 00:53:30	Brock Osweiller to the Denver Broncos! Proud to see a Montana guy on my favorite team. Doesn't hurt he gets to learn under Peyton Manning.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-08 08:12:34	Just won my first game of Fifa on Xbox. I never play video games so this is a significant accomplishment for me.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-08 08:45:16	@FrankCherries what's your opinion about Eminem?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-08 08:47:06	@FrankCherries agreed!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-08 09:07:17	Luke Bryan remix.. I don't want this "semester" to end. I'm right where I need to be in Reno right now. I don't want to leave.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-09 20:45:19	No I'm never gonna feel like that again, time's rushing by me like the wind. Never gonna be as young as I was then.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-10 11:31:14	Today's gonna be an eventful day.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-12 00:27:31	Beach party in the dorms.. It's five o'clock in Reno!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-12 03:06:38	First lift in a week. I feel like I've lost everything.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-12 04:03:40	I'm growing out my hair again. I don't see anyone in the summer so the awkward stage has no power over me.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-13 07:10:04	Karaoke at the Cal Neva.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-17 03:10:50	This town hasn't changed a bit.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-17 22:16:16	Haven't been in a thunderstorm in awhile. Good ol' Montana!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-17 23:34:55	Where I grew up.. We rode in trucks. http://t.co/IlkSstf0
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-18 05:22:17	A little late night workout never hurts. I mean I'm living on a lake all summer right? Gotta get that #beachbody.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-20 00:43:59	I'm stoked to get to the lake and get some new water-skis. One more week at home and then I'm gone for the money and the water.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-20 01:19:26	No mom, I won't take your advice on how to use my fake ID.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-21 10:08:47	I'm glad I've got friends that won't let me drink and drive. I appreciate it guys. Seriously too many friends have come and gone, thank you.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-21 10:10:09	RIP those that I've lost this weekend and in years past. KJKD. And Cody now. See you someday my friends.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-21 21:46:34	Branding on Saturday, building my room Monday, and start work Tuesday. Last week of sleeping my life away.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-21 21:52:20	I've got The Fray on repeat. Such a great band!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-22 05:38:45	I just had the most epic battle with a moth.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-14 00:00:27	Packing all my things.. Memories from the year are going through my head.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-14 01:08:56	Called Grandma for Mother's Day and got advice about love and relationships.  Thanks Grandma!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-14 05:43:09	Final all-nighter of my freshman year of college. Time to save the GPA. #outheregrinding
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-14 06:04:37	How do you study for Physics?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-14 10:26:58	I can't wait to have my long hair again. I seriously miss it.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-14 13:30:45	Just watched one five minute video that would have raised my physics grade an entire letter. Note to self - YouTube lectures save lives.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-23 07:28:30	Dude.. Somebody found a mermaid.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-23 08:31:16	@breedendauw Yep. There's a two hour documentary about it on Animal Planet on Sunday. Looks legit!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-23 19:18:21	@khoaa obviously not Montana. Documentary on Animal Planet Sunday and it looks legit.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-24 05:11:39	I had a phase where I didn't think country music was "cool." That phase lasted maybe a year in middle school.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-15 00:38:02	I think I actually saved my GPA this semester. I'm not ready to leave, but there's cash money calling. I'm an asphalt cowboy now.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-15 01:00:28	@nicollestewart1 I already am a truck driver.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-15 01:01:37	@nicollestewart1 I'm talking about my Dodge! Haha.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-15 08:15:01	Gonna miss my brothers these next couple months.. I can't wait to get back and have the best year of my life all over again.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-15 09:30:19	Last night in the dorms. Seems like just yesterday I was spending the first night here and sweating my balls off because it was 80 degrees.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-15 21:30:33	On the road back to the final frontier.. The Treasure State.. The last best place. Montana.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-19 02:34:56	I at least thought they'd ask what my birthday was, but nope. That's my hometown for you. So easy to get alcohol.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-19 03:06:47	Sipping on some brewskis with my best friend and watching some sports. Having a man night.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-19 03:27:42	@BKWMT University of Maryland, College Park.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-19 03:41:29	Westbrook threw a nice hissy fit there.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-19 04:24:31	@BNASSSSTY I once was a Chow all I had was a dream, more money more problems.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-19 05:31:52	Kobe more clutch than LeBron. 18-18 from the free throw line including many clutch ones down the stretch. LeBron doesn't do that.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-25 03:58:30	Short replies to your texts, and you always have to text first are both #SignsYoureInTheFriendZone.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-25 06:19:48	In the morning I leave home behind. Off to another life experience working in the Oil Field. I can't wait to get out on the lake though.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-25 09:20:48	I've never been much of an animal person. I blame the horse that bucked me off when I was six. Broke my arm.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-16 09:15:08	It's amazing how many song quotes I found myself wanting to tweet while driving back to Montana. And once I got here, I forgot every one.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-16 19:51:53	@tony_castaneda Dude I would die! Haha.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-25 20:46:15	I hate goodbyes.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-25 22:45:37	Hey old friend, thanks for calling. It's good to know somebody cares.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-26 00:41:56	@khoaa not sad! Just posting lyrics to songs that catch my attention.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-16 22:03:56	How did Biggie on the Pauly D Project land such a good looking girl?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-17 03:14:39	Just got the neighbor girl to make me a sandwich. TFM.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-20 22:55:50	I feel like I'm sixteen again. Cleaning horse stalls.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-22 02:55:21	Lakers are by far a tougher team than OKC. OKC is getting babied by the refs. OKC won't get those calls further on in the playoffs.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-22 04:15:29	The young Thunder are in for a rude awakening when they take on the highest scoring veteran offense in the NBA. Road ends in San Antonio.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-22 04:35:16	@ThatNickaNick Miss you too Mick!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-22 19:58:22	@E_2TRILL hockey, golf, baseball.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-22 21:05:41	@E_2TRILL heck I don't know. I'll see if @ryan_eylar can pick it up for me the next time he's there.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-23 00:29:33	The shoes D-Wade is rocking.. are #fresh.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-23 01:14:12	Pacers chances go to zero if Granger gets hurt or suspended.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-23 01:31:52	Just watched the trailer for the new Great Gatsby movie. Not gonna lie, I kinda want to see it. Should be better than the one made in 1974.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-23 05:32:51	I'm so bored I'm reading about Mitt Romney's plans if he becomes president.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-23 20:19:51	@khoaa shut up River Monsters was on!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-28 00:47:58	Fried fish dinner down by the lake. This is the life.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-28 01:12:31	My Aunt - "Those pillows smelled like dust. Well I guess it's better than them smelling like head".. Dad - "Says who?"
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-28 02:30:42	Fatherly advice.. If you're milking a cow and one don't work grab the utter.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-28 03:56:22	When's your birthday? December 4th, 1969! Not because of 69.. I think. My Dad is full of it.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-28 05:20:26	This summer is gonna be filled with funny shit my Dad says. My MP3 player is dead.. Oh yeah? Want me to jump it with that Dodge?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-29 03:37:08	I have to be clean shaven all summer. Who am I kidding I can't grow a beard anyway!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-29 03:57:10	I want to get some Knockarounds with clear lenses so I can be stylish like all the NBA players.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-30 02:42:25	My God, San Antonio is too good. They may be old but they are putting on a basketball clinic. Thunder too young, won't stay in it mentally.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-30 14:56:02	Wearing the hardhat at work like a champ. Another day another dollar.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-01 11:16:09	I ain't no angel, I've still got a few more dances with the devil.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-01 23:27:17	My current tan includes only my neck and cheeks.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-02 04:56:44	Commercial about a man attending his own funeral as a guy named "Phil Shiftly." Why is there a coffin? He faked his death. No body.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-02 05:01:07	MLB needs expanded replay.. Carlos Beltran's base hit was called foul. Santana ends up throwing a fake no-hitter.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-02 19:57:22	80 degrees on a Saturday afternoon and I'm stuck building a shed. I get to watch everyone drive by headed to the lake. Torture.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-03 01:25:47	Just had a solid Kenpo workout.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-03 23:03:49	It was nice when I lived at home and could save money from my paychecks. Now I buy gas and groceries. Well I guess this is growing up.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-04 03:06:18	LeBron was just the victim of two potentially game changing calls.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-08 14:54:29	Today is all overtime. And it's Friday. Today is a good day.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-07 03:14:28	Harden can flop too!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-09 01:59:47	Spending the night with some family and a $180 bottle of Crown Royal XR.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-09 02:03:56	Quote of the night. I'm not balding I just rubbed all my hair off on the headboard.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-07 11:29:09	Go get your girl, go make a drag. If you're lucky you can take her 'cross the railroad tracks where the man on the moon works his magic.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-07 12:56:26	It's pouring rain, so I'm literally getting paid to sit in the truck right now. I ain't even mad.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-07 17:56:02	My old MySpace account is like one of those time capsules you buried as a kid. It's filled with pictures from middle school.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-03 01:44:11	@khoaa I'll stick to my Animal Planet show!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-30 01:12:20	Spurs are looking tough on both ends of the floor tonight. Thunder need to get Durant involved now, or things are gonna get ugly real quick.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-30 01:19:17	Tony Parker is tearing it up. By the time he was Russell Westbrook's age, he had two NBA championship rings.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-30 03:47:49	Work at 5:30 in the morning? I ain't even mad. Money is a good alarm clock.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-09 22:44:08	Been putting in a sprinkler system all day. Getting some much needed sun while doing man stuff.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-05 00:12:46	I want to see you again, but I'm stuck in Colder Weather.. Maybe tomorrow will be better. Can I call you then?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-11 11:47:26	John Mayer lives in Bozeman.. Since when?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-12 22:03:55	I don't see OKC guarding King James, Batman (Wade), and The Velociraptor (Bosh) all at the same time. Sorry Thunder, maybe next time.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-13 03:48:47	It's gonna be a fun series to watch! Thunder stay perfect at home. If they take game two, they will win the title. Likewise for Miami.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-08 22:14:14	Playing my old man in basketball. He says.. You're Orden Vinger. You ain't got no "J." Touché pops. Touché.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-09 03:42:40	The cherry's gone but that's no sin, the box is there that the fruit came in.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-09 06:39:06	It seems like one side of my family is way closer than the other side.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-10 20:12:29	Kenny Chesney's new album released Tuesday? Yes please.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-11 11:22:51	Up and ready for another week! Time to do some work.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-12 17:07:03	@Cat_Rutledge luckily for you, it got shut down early Saturday. That's what saved you. The AIDS man didn't have time to strike.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-05-31 17:17:17	Check out my new outfit.. I'm feeling pretty sexy. http://t.co/c2FsrEDJ
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-01 04:12:34	I dropped $70 on a pair of flame resistant Wranglers so I don't have to wear that wiggity wiggity whack suit anymore.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-01 04:15:16	Too bad The Buckle doesn't sell flame resistant jeans.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-03 02:37:32	Is the perfect streak at home for the Thunder going to end tonight?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-05 20:23:28	That was fourteen hundred and fifty-two beers ago.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-06 02:55:08	Dwayne Wade sending that shot up into the rafters should be worthy of #SCtop10.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-06 20:19:51	#LilWayneOnceSaid he sees she wearin' them jeans that show her butt-crack. My girl can't wear that. Why? That's where my stash at.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-07 03:32:13	Oklahoma City, a little respect from me has been earned. But I still strongly dislike you, your skinny star, and hipster point guard.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-09 06:09:06	Got kicked out two months ago. I'm all like.. I don't even live here! Oh well I puked on their driveway.. They don't even have a driveway!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-12 00:28:31	I want one of those old cast iron toy banks that are always on Pawn Stars.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-12 03:10:18	Mardi Gras should be a legal holiday in EVERY state. Not just Louisiana.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-15 03:07:57	I think this is the 4th quarter where LeBron proves to the world that he can close games and he is the best player in the world.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-15 03:34:14	Nevermind, LeBron is too much of a team player. Won't take over the game.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-12 12:10:47	One single thought about you can be powerful motivation.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-15 20:15:14	Wake up to my dad yelling it's ten to six! I sit up and I'm like damn my alarm didn't go off. Look at my phone.. It's 5:15. Touché.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-16 00:37:19	So I peel my banana and while holding it, try to open the peanut butter jar. Banana, meet floor. Floor, meet banana.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-13 22:35:11	We spent what little bit of money we had on Wintergreen Skoal and main street gas.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-17 02:45:55	I'm not from South Carolina.. But my cock is game.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-17 02:51:13	I'm not gonna lie. That commercial where Just For Men puts a beard on that baby.. Hilarious.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-17 17:42:11	Great morning of fishing to start the summer! I caught two of the three including the 24 inch walleye on the right. http://t.co/rzcm0KCh
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-18 16:53:41	I operated a man lift 100 feet in the air this morning. No big deal.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-18 17:03:38	Memory lane up in the headlights has got me reminiscing all them good times.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-18 20:24:41	If a girl can take a liking to you while you're in the awkward stage.. You've got a good one.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-19 03:42:51	Does it make it less girly if I do Yoga in the middle of a raging thunderstorm?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-20 03:54:24	Russell WB had an amazing game, but it wasn't enough. No Harden hurts. Chalmers offense and Batman's ferocious swats were too much tonight.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-20 04:06:30	I don't see Russell Westbrook alongside Kevin Durant for the rest of their careers. WB needs to be the absolute star, no sharing.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-26 22:40:58	My legs feel naked when I don't wear calf high socks with shorts.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-27 15:15:08	I don't have a favorite NBA team, but it's time to get one. Whichever team drafts @AustinRivers25 will be my new team.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-30 02:18:11	Was it something I said, or something I did? Did my words not come out right?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-23 05:06:12	Working another full day tomorrow. Sixty hours this week.. Cash money.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-28 02:55:48	Every rose has its thorn.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-23 11:39:08	Memorable night, that's for sure.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-22 00:14:01	Hey did you do your chores? Yep. Milked the cow and everything. But we don't have a cow.. We have a bull.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-22 03:48:53	So happy for LeBron James and the rest of the Miami Heat.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-01 22:08:52	I was about two inches shy of scrotum loss while waterskiing today. Other than that the day was a success.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-02 00:39:47	One of my all time favorite television shows is back. The Real World.. In the Virgin Islands!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-02 12:17:24	I don't think that I can take this bed getting any colder.. come over.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-02 22:54:46	I was praying that she couldn't tell I'd never been that far before.. The first time's a one time feeling and I never wanted nothin' more.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-02 23:20:01	Stopped at a stoplight at construction. The light turns green and this white truck doesn't move. We drive by.. Driver was passed out!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-02 23:25:41	I was lucky enough to see Dontrelle Willis pitch in the 2003 NLCS against the Cubs. I also witnessed history in the Steve Bartman game.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-24 21:21:11	I don't care about your opinion of Nickelback. Photograph will always be one of my favorite songs.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-25 02:26:41	This was honestly one of the best weekends of my life. And I even worked another ten hour shift on Saturday.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-03 20:29:39	After working 15 of the last 16 days, I can finally say it's the weekend. Thank you America, for saving me.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-03 22:24:09	@kelseycornwell I just did it too! I'm on week six. Every time I do Plyometrics, it's literally the sweatiest I've ever been!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-04 00:26:46	A neutron walks into a bar and asks the bartender, "How much for a drink?" The bartender says, "For you? No charge."
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-04 03:18:20	I appreciate it when a good thing ends because you decided that texting frequently isn't okay, and that shunning me is. Without reason.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-04 03:44:22	The start was something good, but some good things must end.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-29 00:29:23	Already ordered my Austin Rivers jersey.. Welcome to New Orleans.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-26 18:08:54	I think I'll do a little waterskiing after work.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-29 12:54:34	I wonder what my life would be like now if I had transferred my junior year.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-29 17:32:56	I still eat #CrackedPepperSpitz sunflower seeds in large quantities even though I'm not playing baseball anymore.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-04 15:59:05	I thank God for my life, and for the stars and stripes. May freedom forever fly.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-29 17:48:40	I'm the kind of guy that can put Carrie under wood.. I can also make Sheryl crow.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-05 22:08:53	I feel like the NBA isn't in equilibrium right now with all these players going to different teams.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-06-30 20:25:14	Alright who's the wise guy drawing penises on hardhats?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-06 02:12:06	Who would have guessed I'd wind up playing a night of softball in Turtle Lake, North Dakota?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-06 05:29:24	Dude.. I've had a phone charger here the whole time. I don't care, I got to see a big f*cking turtle and stuff.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-06 21:49:12	Eating fresh honey straight from the hive.. Amazing.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-06 22:25:01	Wherever you are, and whatever you're doing, you're missing out.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-07 00:42:52	I'm not getting the hat, it's too small.. Dude. It's a SnapBack.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-07 03:37:52	Everyone can be heartless. But you take it to another level..
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-07 23:10:34	Project X, North Dakota style. #ProjectSandbar here we come.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-08 01:54:49	Hey.. I have a little native in me. Want a little more?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-08 19:29:22	Last night I let the party get the best of me. #ProjectSandbar
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-09 00:53:30	It started out with a kiss how did it end up like this? It was only a kiss.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-10 02:36:24	All the dreams you never thought you'd lose.. Were tossed along the way.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-10 11:16:19	@Guernseyy93 that's one of my favorite songs of all time and definitely my favorite Jimmy Eat World song.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-10 15:03:04	Had to jump in a six foot deep hole to rescue a gopher this morning. Doesn't mean I like animals, just didn't want the little guy to die.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-10 17:14:31	The newest thing I get made fun of by all the old guys at work.. "You could be one of those gay boy band singers."
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-10 17:48:36	That goes hand in hand with me being as famous as Little Red Riding Hood, just as "Little White Teethy Boy" instead.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-11 03:29:38	Somebody please get Melky Cabrera Rosetta Stone.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-21 21:22:40	Stoked to see Zac Brown Band tonight with my Dad.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-22 02:09:48	Just met a Lambda Chi from the University of Indiana in Minot.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-22 17:32:02	Zac Brown Band concert last night in Minot, ND. http://t.co/4KJztxl0
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-22 22:02:35	The whiskey's gone.. But I ain't leavin'.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-12 01:43:52	My eye just decided that it needed shampoo just a little bit more than my hair did.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-11 23:22:55	The #BestTeam in my opinion goes to the St. Louis Cardinals. They had one of the best runs in the history of Major League Baseball.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-11 23:32:17	I think I'm going to give in to peer pressure and buy some pre-workout the next time I'm near a GNC.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-13 03:14:05	Good to see Anthony Davis play well for #TeamUSA. I can't wait for NBA 2K13 to come out so I can dominate as the Hornets. #ARivers #ADavis
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-13 03:23:26	People need to get off Joe Paterno's back. Sandusky committed the horrid crimes. Leave JoPa alone. He's pushing up daisies, give him peace.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-12 17:56:31	That guy hauling portable toilets has a shitty job.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-13 15:26:37	@MaasCollin I'm as Norwegian as they make 'em! What's good bro?
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-13 17:33:57	Not to mention, the swag that Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan had, and still have is electrifying.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-23 16:54:35	"The Better B" cafe huh? Yep. It's good eatin' in there. Oh yeah? It better be.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-14 07:44:40	We got weird tonight in Wolf Point, Montana.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-15 21:38:29	I need to sweat out all the alcohol in my system.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-13 17:32:43	I honestly agree that the Dream Team would beat this team. I've seen the videos from 1992 and that team has more heart and desire to win.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-13 17:49:32	@MaasCollin you bet your ass I'll be there! I put the "bar" in sandbar!
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-16 16:36:50	The van selling stickers and car decals is a real "stickler" when it comes to prices.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-17 00:49:00	@willi2469 damn right. Leave it to me to find a way to stay fratty in North Dakota. #TFTC
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-16 17:19:39	@tony_castaneda it's only forty dollars or less.. I want to see some receipts! Four Jaeger-Bombs and if I remember correctly we shared food.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-18 02:03:15	A couple of deceased ants fell into the bowl as I poured my cereal. I removed them and continued eating because, #I'mStillAGuy.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-18 12:43:52	Every time you take a sip, in this smoky atmosphere. You press that bottle to your lips, and I wish I was your beer.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-17 17:27:45	I just gave this mean looking construction worker the most gangster "what up" head nod ever.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-24 20:33:46	I'm a tool, and I got used.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-25 01:31:10	Poison's Greatest Hits album on repeat.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-25 02:40:50	Seriously needed this recovery week. Even though it's not easy, it's a step down from the main weeks. #P90X
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-25 11:17:01	@khoaa that is the only tweet containing an emoji that I've ever considered retweeting. I literally smiled at that one.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-19 02:24:17	A tank of gas is a treasure to me. I know now that nothing is free.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-19 22:13:50	No Jason Aldean. Days like these? They go by way too slow.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-19 22:40:11	My Dad's thought process about relationships.. She ain't your girl unless she lets you poop in front of her.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-20 17:35:39	If the NBA added advertisements on jerseys, I probably would never buy one again. Don't ruin the uniforms with that garbage.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-20 20:13:44	No, we wouldn't get the jersey with advertisements when we buy one. But it still wouldn't be the same as the in-game jersey, and that sucks.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-21 03:38:44	At the North Dakota State Fair. Pretty dope.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-25 16:58:34	I hope my boss doesn't fire me for viewing dragonfly intercourse on the job.. I just couldn't look away.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-25 21:45:53	For my #Kenpo session today, I'm simply going to imagine I'm kicking the shit out of James Holmes.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-26 12:27:35	According to my coworker, I've been investing all my money in Elton John posters. You caught me, I do know the words to Rocket Man.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-27 17:28:53	I hope Blake Shelton plays "Austin" tonight. That's my favorite song of his. It's old, but still good.
287420512	jordenvinger	2012-07-28 15:12:56	I go back to the loss of a real good friend and the sixteen summers I shared with him. Only the good die young. Rest in peace Dez.

287420512	jordenvinger	2013-03-29 03:31:24	If I played basketball my nickname would be "Nicky Flash." Wait.. Why Nicky? "Because it rhymes with Flash."

287420512	jordenvinger	2013-03-28 02:14:26	Joell limps into our house grabbing her arm complaining about her back hurting or something. Told her we have some "Back Velvet" for her.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-03-31 22:06:24	You love chips. Chips love salsa.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-01 07:40:13	As we were hoofin' it home last night, a tree branch smacked me in the head and damn near knocked me out in some random yard.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-02 04:36:45	Hey Skeeter, the dollar store has wine glasses. Skeeter, "Really! How much?!"

287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-06 00:42:07	Hey.. I'm sorry about that time I saw you naked. I was pretty blacked out but you have nice tits.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-07 19:19:33	Hey you know what would be funny? To hide these snow tires around the house during the party!
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-07 19:20:38	Dude. Throw up in the washing machine. That would be way cooler.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-06 19:31:42	"You're a good kisser!" Yeah I know. I've had a lot of practice on my arm.

287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-08 07:21:48	"I got hazed by this little Asian dude." Really? Why? "We were arguing and he made some really good points!"
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-09 20:21:16	Hand sanitizer malfunction leads people to believe that I ejaculated on my wall.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-12 03:45:16	I asked this girl from North Dakota if she likes sushi. She says, "Nah I ain't a lesbian! I like Siouxhe." Who's with me?
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-11 03:46:37	Tried sushi for the first time ever tonight. Tipped the waiter a couple bucks for teaching me Spanish.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-10 16:24:01	I said NO you're wrong. And she yelled at me. And I peed my pants. And I'm still wearing my pee pants.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-12 21:13:01	On the way to Oakland. I shit you not this fucker was carrying a porta-potty on his back.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-13 02:38:37	It's getting a little chilly at the game here. We should get up and move around a little bit.. And by that I mean we should drink more beer.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-13 02:45:52	Sitting here SnapChatting at the A's game. Almost took a foul ball to the face but hey, still got the SnapChat off in time.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-13 04:42:12	Friend flooded the house in 5th grade. He put fins on his feet so he "wouldn't get pee-pee water on them."
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-13 04:46:06	Dear Santa,

287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-18 02:12:59	Just ate 26 chicken nuggets in case you were wondering about the size of my dong.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-18 05:39:40	Weren't you a Boy Scout? No. But I ate a Brownie once.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-18 22:23:39	Have class at 2:00 tomorrow. Have a tee time at 12:45. Figure we'll be done by then. If not I'll have an excuse to miss class.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-18 22:55:50	In case you guys didn't notice, the funny part about my previous tweet is that there is no way we could possibly play 18 holes in one hour.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-19 16:00:10	Got pre-workout in my eye this morning and two hours later it's still doing bicep curls.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-18 17:15:07	Joe legit ate shit in the shower this morning. Fell completely out of the shower, broke the curtain rod and everything.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-18 17:21:10	He's about as graceful as a baby calf walking for the first time, all the time.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-18 17:26:32	He then tried to talk trash to me and I informed him that he's pretty good at speaking English for someone who just learned how to walk.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-20 08:36:11	Is that a Jewish flag? No dude, that's the Alaska state flag.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-20 09:57:11	We'd have been fuckin' State Champs if Joe had made those free throws.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-20 19:33:34	Lady A, I have never smoked while J-walking like it was my birthday every other Saturday night. That's why I don't take you downtown.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-20 20:31:56	Thought this girl was barking at me. Turns out it was actually a dog.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-19 20:07:14	It's alright that the guys in front of us play slow. Gives us more opportunity for mulligans and alcohol. It's a win-win.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-19 21:53:47	No wonder I'm having a hard time hitting the golf ball! There's three of them!
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-21 19:26:40	When you're born you don't like water. You like breast milk. Eventually if you drink enough water, you like it. Same goes with Black Velvet.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-21 19:29:13	Kids, if you don't wear your sunscreen you'll pee blood.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-23 20:06:27	Ladies came over to tan in my backyard. Baked cupcakes and brought us squirt guns, and then get mad at me when I shoot them. I don't get it.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-24 05:32:40	Me and Skeeter just ganged up on Joe with squirt guns.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-24 16:11:06	Just had an intense argument about farming with Joe over breakfast. We must be moving to North Dakota for good.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-25 01:51:10	You see the thing about vacuums is.. If they don't suck, they're actually a pretty sucky vacuum.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-27 03:48:59	We'd have been fuckin' State Champs but Joe fumbled on the kneel down in the fourth quarter.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-28 23:19:20	William Wallace gets all the hot girls.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-27 18:40:53	Joe used my bed to eat his Jack in the Box last night. Bro, we have legit tables in this house.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-30 00:27:09	You are terrible goalie. You can't even stop beach ball. Beach ball is bigger than puck. That's why joke is.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-26 19:40:26	This "Winkta" Joe comes in my room and starts flossing. No.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-27 02:53:10	Catching a foul ball in your beer cup is a reason girls will marry you.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-27 03:01:26	Ballpark vendor walked by, "Get your lemonade it's still warm out here folks!" Bullshit. I can hear your tooth chattering.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-04-27 03:41:21	We'd have been fuckin' State Champs if Joe didn't strike out with bases loaded and 3-0 count in the bottom of the 9th. Swung at two in dirt.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-02 01:28:38	Joe, "Ugh. I get on Facebook, and I'm like this is gay shit so I get off. I'm back on 5 minutes later." Me, "Maybe you just like gay shit."
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-02 01:37:22	Joe whining about sore arm after throwing squish ball at wall constantly. Me, "It wouldn't hurt if you didn't have to throw your hardest."
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-02 16:28:15	Gonna dress up as a five pound jar of mayonnaise this weekend for the parties. You can call me "Cinco de Mayo."
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-06 01:23:07	Joe, "Buns expired May 2nd. Think they're still good?" He smells bun and says, "You can usually smell mold." Yep you can usually see it too.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-04 20:22:52	Put the toilet seat cover down for first time in months. Was a muddy footprint on it. Guy standing on it was high on pot.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-06 22:50:40	Joe bought a fifty dollar flannel yesterday. Today he's wearing a ten dollar one he got at an outlet mall.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-05 18:19:34	Ordering at IHOP. Lady asks Joe how he'd like his eggs cooked. Joe, "Medium well please."
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-05 18:52:22	Joe tries to take small sip of his water. Full glass spills all over his shorts in IHOP. Legit looks like he pee'd himself.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-06 01:22:41	Explaining to my Dad what a "coupler" is (part of trailer that fits over hitch ball). He says, "I'd like to catch me a coupler walleyes."
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-06 01:23:31	Water fowl swimming in the aqueduct by our house. I think I'll call them "aquaducks."
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-10 05:49:51	In the last five minutes I about put a hole in the garage door, broke my back, and got crushed by a Uhaul trailer. And killed a black widow.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-10 06:56:47	About went Johnny Cash on a mofo during my last night in Reno but it was a false alarm. No one was breaking in, shelf fell off the wall.

287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-09 03:28:54	Joe brought up an excellent question. When a woman has hemophilia, what happens when she loses her virginity?
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-09 07:08:17	The Finals won't hold you tonight. The Finals don't know you're alive. The Finals don't care if you're all alone.. But I do, I do.
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-11 16:32:16	The room is starting to spin.. From all the Boise State gear.

287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-13 13:06:30	Dom, "Got deaf around these big trucks. Imagine all the pretty little girls that have been 'Hey Dommy wanna fuck?' And I never heard them."
287420512	jordenvinger	2013-05-15 02:54:07	@Cody_Willits what 'willits' take to get you to shut the fuck up?
