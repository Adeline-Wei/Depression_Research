2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 21:42:44	Summary of Rickie.

Read: http://t.co/T8Tql4goTY
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 21:49:50	Rickie groaned, "So, what is going on now?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 21:53:22	@redroyarsenal {{Sure}}
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 21:55:35	"Aww. Who has time to deal with feelings?" Rickie tossed her hands in the air. "Loosen up, friends!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 21:58:31	@RedDeadHood Rickie had been behind the counter, playing with straws since the diner was hardly ever busy. She'd heard the chime of the [c]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 21:59:29	@RedDeadHood door's bell and her eyes shot up, spotting the man walking in. She quickly grabbed a menu and made her way around the [c]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 22:01:01	@RedDeadHood counter, almost tripping and made her way to the Diner's bar.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 22:01:31	@redroyarsenal "Aww. Thank you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 22:04:01	"My way or the high-...." She stopped. "No, it's either my way or get punched in the face."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 22:08:01	@RedDeadHood Rickie set the menu down on the bar counter. "Welcome to Gotham Diner." She said in a fake cheerful town. "I'll be your [c]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 22:08:18	@RedDeadHood server for the evening."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 22:13:03	@RedDeadHood She rose a brow. "Oh, okay." She turned hesitantly and walked off back toward the counter. Before getting his coffee, Rickie[c]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 22:14:03	@RedDeadHood stood there watching him for a solid three minutes. She poured the coffee, but still stood behind the counter watching his[c]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 22:15:03	@RedDeadHood every move. Something about him was...off...but Rickie couldn't put her finger on it. She eventually walked back to the bar[c]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 22:15:23	@RedDeadHood , setting the coffee down. "Here..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 22:18:53	@RedDeadHood "Any specific kind?" Rickie asked, putting a hand on her hip.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 22:26:50	@RedDeadHood Rickie's smile immediately fell. "Thank god.." She turned. "I'll be back, dude." She made her way to the back to the kitchen.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-04 22:28:54	"What is the difference between wrong and right? Is there a difference?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 02:28:05	"Hmm...so..." Rickie placed one hand on her hip. "I'm not new to any of this shiz...RT..." Rickie rolled her eyes. "Please?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 02:30:32	@FabledZorEl "Ermm...? Did I break you..?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 02:34:06	"Why would I waste my hate on you, Barbie?"

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 02:39:13	"Well, I'm Rickie Wayne and I live in Gotham..so.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 02:40:49	"You know it really sucks being the only girl sibling...do you know how many times my brother's have tried to shave my head?" Rickie [c]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 02:41:23	@TheRickieWayne huffed. "Too many times..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 02:42:20	@SonOfBman "A person was asking."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 02:42:35	@HoistOfDarkness "Gotham.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 02:44:54	@HoistOfDarkness "I'm Rickie..''
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 02:52:55	"I'm sensing rudeness."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:08:46	@RedDeadHood  She grabbed the last piece of apple pie and walked back out to the man."There ya' go."She said,setting it down on the counter.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:12:46	Rickie sat on a barrel in an ally, focusing on a box. She'd do this everyday....practice... The box then began to levitate while a smirk&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:13:06	@TheRickieDeval &lt;spread across her lips.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:15:59	@RedDeadHood She rolled her eyes at the obvious sarcasm. "Oh yeah, /always/ busy."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:21:27	@RedDeadHood "Eh'...it's not the worse neighborhood but defiantly not the greatest." She shrugged, walking back toward the counter.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:25:42	"Not the greatest job. Heh'." http://t.co/B356fLl5iE
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:27:27	@FabledZorEl "And yours isn't?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:32:27	@RedDeadHood She grabbed a rag from the sink and made her way to one of the empty tables, beginning to wipe it off. "Oh really? Hmm...I&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:32:41	@RedDeadHood &lt;suppose it is."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:35:07	@redroyarsenal Rickie didn't know if the man was talking to her or not so she kept walking down the sidewalk.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:39:41	@redroyarsenal Rickie stopped, raising her brow. "Hi..?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:41:07	@redroyarsenal "I'm...Rickie.." She spoke hesitantly.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:46:32	@redroyarsenal "Oh...uhm..yeah, sure."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:54:18	@RedDeadHood "I clean...or hang out back in the ally.." She turned toward the old man in the booth. "Yo', Dave!" The man jolted awake at&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:54:53	@RedDeadHood &lt;her yelling. "He's alive...he's a regular."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:55:26	@redroyarsenal "Sure.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 02:58:19	"Nobody cares."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 02:59:35	"Oh, do you now?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 03:03:17	"Who said anything about me being nice, Barbie?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 03:05:02	"Pretty much, yeah. Get used to it."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 03:19:31	"Obviously you, you airhead."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 03:20:40	"Shut up? Nah."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 03:22:04	"Ya' think?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 00:57:29	@redroyarsenal She slid in the chair in front of him. "Yup."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 01:02:14	@redroyarsenal She laughed. "I never said that."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 01:04:22	@redroyarsenal "Well, I'm sorry." She crossed her arms.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 01:08:48	@RedDeadHood She walked to the next table, cleaning it as well."Jason? Cool name. Mine is Rickie."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 01:15:39	@redroyarsenal "What do ya' want to know?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 01:21:01	@redroyarsenal "I'm from New York...I just happened to stumble upon this city and boom..I stayed."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 01:28:08	@redroyarsenal "I'm sure I'll be fine."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 01:32:29	@redroyarsenal "Hmm..I don't think so."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 01:37:58	@redroyarsenal She looked at him suspiciously. "Like..?
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 04:00:37	@MrSuperiority "Indeed."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-03 04:04:41	@FabledZorEl Rickie strolled up to the blonde, her hands shoved in her pockets. "Sucks, don't it?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 01:42:18	"The backstreets of Gotham. Just doing some exploring." http://t.co/k2iLT649ps
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 01:42:26	@redroyarsenal "Surprise?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 01:44:48	@redroyarsenal "I..I don't know."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 01:48:38	@redroyarsenal "I'm sorry but...no. I-..I don't know you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 02:05:10	@RedDeadHood She stopped cleaning the table and stared at the wall ahead of her blankly. "It's unique...and strange." She turned, walking&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 02:05:41	@RedDeadHood &lt;back toward the counter. "I like that. It's different."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 02:28:11	Rickie held a dead rose in her hand the petals wilting, her hair covering her face. "Pretty as a rose...and I learned every rose has&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 02:29:50	@TheRickieDeval  &lt;it's thorns." She dropped the rose to the ground. "But even their defenses shall not stop me." She turned, walking away.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 02:37:07	"My temper gets the best of me at times. Deal with it."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 02:39:03	@ChocolateSupes "Cranky? Not in the slightest, sir."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 02:41:07	@ChocolateSupes She shook his hand firmly. "The name's Rickie."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 02:43:10	@ChocolateSupes "I am fantastic. Yourself, Val'?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 02:45:55	@ChocolateSupes "Heroing?" She asked curiously.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 02:48:22	@ChocolateSupes She fake acts surprised. "Woah.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 02:50:23	@ChocolateSupes "Umm.." She rubbed her arm nervously.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 02:52:46	@ChocolateSupes She muttered "Well, I..I can move things with my mind and I just found out I can manipulate people mentally.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 02:59:24	@ChocolateSupes She shook her head. "I..I don't know if it'll work on you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:00:53	@ChocolateSupes She shrugged."Maybe I could try."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:02:37	@ChocolateSupes She laughed. "Okay." She then became quiet, focusing on him as hard as she could. Her eyes began to glow a light blue as&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:03:11	@ChocolateSupes &lt;she sent a command to his mind. [Drop to the ground]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:05:12	@ChocolateSupes Rickie yelped a little at his sudden fall. "I-..It worked!?" She put a hand on her forehead. "It worked on a super!!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:10:43	@ChocolateSupes "It works every time I try but...I just...I never tried it on a being like yourself. Mainly just practice on cats and dogs."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:14:58	@ChocolateSupes She nodded. "Of course.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:19:13	Rickie leaned against the diner counter, the place being empty for about an hour. She'd just finished cleaning up. ["Rickie! Shifts over,&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:20:39	@TheRickieDeval &lt;kid, head home."] She heard from her boss, Layla but she called her Lay'. Rickie pushed off the counter and untied her&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:21:40	@TheRickieDeval &lt;little apron, draping it over the counter. She grabbed her coat pulling it on, knowing the November air would not be kind&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:22:40	@TheRickieDeval &lt;to her. She started toward the door but yelled. "Bye, Lay'. See ya' tomorrow." Rickie flipped the open sign on the door to&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:24:04	@TheRickieDeval &lt;closed. She pushed the door open and walked out, hugging her coat around her. Rickie then began down the sidewalk toward&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:25:07	@TheRickieDeval &lt;her apartment but instead of going all the way there she cut into an alleyway. She always came here after work to&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:26:21	@TheRickieDeval &lt;…practice… "Here, kitty, kitty." She called. A smokey gray cat was always back here and she wanted to test her new ability&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:27:21	@TheRickieDeval The cat sat lazily in front of her, meowing. Rickie stared down at it as the meowing became louder. Rickie focused as her&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:28:18	@TheRickieDeval &lt;eyes began to glow light blue. Then as she did earlier on the super..she sent a command to the animals brain. [Stop that&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:29:26	@TheRickieDeval &lt;meowing] The cat stopped immediately. Rickie smiled in satisfaction. [Now walk away] The creature simply turned walking&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:30:30	@TheRickieDeval &lt;down the alley. 
Rickie released her focus on the animal.
Now this...this was cool. She turned on her heels, heading for&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:30:39	@TheRickieDeval &lt;home.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:32:58	@RedDeadHood She left the rag on the table and made her way over to him, grabbing the plate. "About a year.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 03:45:30	"The easy way is never the right way."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 04:03:12	"Damian getting all feisty! Down, kitty! Down!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 04:14:51	@RedDeadHood "Lay'? No. She's home sick." She frowned. "Poor woman." She looked at the clock on the wall. "Aren't you tired?" Her attention&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 04:15:08	@RedDeadHood &gt;going back to Jason.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 04:02:10	"Come..touch-
But you will pay a price."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 04:21:19	"Obviously attracted to one another..just...oblivious!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 04:30:21	"My gun is bigger than yours.." Rickie sneered. http://t.co/2jYT84V9lj
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 04:31:48	"CooCoo for CoCo puffs...?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 04:36:09	"Why does every story have a happy ending? 

Bad endings seem more...interesting."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 04:44:55	Rickie looked at the stitches in her calf.  "Don't play with glass, kids.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 04:46:10	@FabledZorEl "Your sarcasm is not needed, alien."

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 06:03:22	Rickie sat in a park, on a bench. "Calm...cool...collected." [Why the hell are you out here? It's the middle of the night!] She thought to&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 06:04:26	@TheRickieDeval &lt;herself but ignored the thought. Until something...in her head went off. Like a binging sound...like a notification.&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 06:05:26	@TheRickieDeval &lt;Rickie stood slowly. She knew..she was being watched...

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 20:03:54	@RedDeadHood She furrowed her brow. "Like hell I'm going to leave you in the diner alone!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 20:17:21	@RedDeadHood "The diner is my responsibility." She paused l, remembering he'd mentioned the mob earlier. Her eyes grew wide."Are you part&gt;

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 20:44:23	@ChocolateSupes She shrugged. "Just felt like saying Mufasa.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 20:45:59	@ChocolateSupes "I'm sorry!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 20:54:38	Rickie rubbed her temples, her head feeling as if it were throbbing. "Stupid headaches..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 21:02:02	@ChocolateSupes "Who doesn't, honestly." She gave a slight laugh.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 21:05:28	@RedDeadHood "...." She kept quiet for a moment, then turned to the old man in the booth."Dave, it's closing time.." She then turned&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 21:06:43	@RedDeadHood &lt;back toward Jason, her face expressionless as the man took his time leaving. "...they're not coming into the diner."

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 05:10:33	@TheJoker_origin Rickie studied him. "Your clown make up is a mess, dude."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 05:12:14	"....." Rickie returned the stare, narrowing her eyes. Getting on her tip toes, trying to seem taller.

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 22:42:33	@RedDeadHood Her eyes had darted to Hood but she quickly placed her attention back on the men. "No..I mean, yes..a-..and I don't know what&gt;

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 22:50:39	@RedDeadHood Rickie yelped , diving under one of the tables. Clinging to the table leg as if it were a life line.

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 22:56:58	@RedDeadHood &lt;late. Rickie swooshed her hand to the side, sending tables flying, and glass breaking. One of the tables changed course&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 22:57:44	@RedDeadHood &lt;hitting the man that was coming toward her with tremendous speed and power.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 23:18:05	@RedDeadHood Rickie had no interest in listening to him as she stood up, striding up behind Jason. Her eyes glowed a light blue, her face&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 23:19:23	@RedDeadHood &lt;blank as she pushed Jason to the side. "Move..." The blood gushed out of the place the man's ear used to be. She had no&gt;

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-05 23:27:32	@RedDeadHood Rickie snapped out of her trance, staring at him. "W-..What'd I do?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 00:41:39	@RedDeadHood She winced at his tone. "...I'm sorry. I-..I didn't mean to!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 00:44:46	"Watching this movie, Red Dawn....I love it!" Rickie screeched. "Action...Action..ACTION!!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 00:55:47	@RedDeadHood She stayed sitting on the ground, surrounded by the wreckage she'd created. "What do I do!?" She snapped.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 00:59:34	@RedDeadHood "You think I haven't tried to control myself!?" She scoffed, getting up and brushed herself off. "...whatever. Just go.."

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 05:43:36	She headbutted his arm, not hard but enough to start her little tantrum. "I asked nicely! Now smile!"

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 05:45:44	@TheJoker_origin She took in a deep breath. "....nope."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 05:47:24	She stared. "Ooo....shocky!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 05:48:02	@TheJoker_origin Her eyes followed him. "Am not!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 05:50:27	"You're pressing buttons, clown man..press the wrong one...you're getting knocked straight on your ass."

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 03:20:10	@DCUTheJoker "Um. No. I don't need a man."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 03:21:18	@BlackRingPower "...I guess death is all you really know, huh?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 03:22:19	@DCUTheJoker "Is that so?"

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 03:31:52	@DCUTheJoker "Actually, I wasn't thinking of doing that...but.." Her words trailed off.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 03:36:21	@DCUTheJoker She was tempted but took a step back, "Nah."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 03:38:06	@DCUTheJoker Rickie became angry quickly. "A what!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 03:39:47	@DCUTheJoker "Don't test your luck, buddy.." She shook her head. "You insensitive prick!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 03:42:02	@DCUTheJoker "......whatever." She turned, walking away.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 03:43:56	"Oh, Roy, I need your help. Yep.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 04:06:32	@ClonedRedArrow "Such a gentleman.''
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 04:13:32	@ClonedRedArrow "Scared? Good." She walks away.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 23:00:35	@DeliciousLucius She looked at him in disbelief. "No! I am not paying!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 23:06:26	@DeliciousLucius "No, you are the one who asked me to go on this little dinner...so...yeah." She crossed her arms. "I will not pay for you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 23:17:20	@DeliciousLucius She rolled her eyes. "Stop being so dramatic."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 23:21:36	@DeliciousLucius She turned away from him. "Again...no. Go beg someone else."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 23:25:38	@DeliciousLucius She turned quickly, grabbing his wrist. "We are /not/ robbing a bank!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 23:30:16	@DeliciousLucius "Nope! No robbing!" She released him.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 23:34:11	@DeliciousLucius She furrowed her brow. "No.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 23:35:25	"....not that easy, buddy."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 23:38:29	@DeliciousLucius "I-..." She was confused. "What!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 23:44:33	@DeliciousLucius "How do I know you'll pay me back..?"

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 23:57:01	@DeliciousLucius "You're a player, I see. I don't have time for players, Lucius, you're wasting your time!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-09 00:01:46	@DeliciousLucius "I've been nothing but bitchy toward you. Why are you refusing on giving up doing something with me?" She growled.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-09 00:09:20	@DeliciousLucius She stared at him for a moment in silence then turned and started walking. She then stopped and grumbled, barely audible.&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-09 00:12:22	@DeliciousLucius Her cheeks went red with embarrassment as she turned, walking past him speedily. "I knew that.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-09 00:15:12	@DeliciousLucius She pulled her arm away from him. "Knew that too.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-09 00:20:43	@DeliciousLucius She walked a few steps a head, smiling big. "Come on, Luci'....you wanna take a walk! Let's go, Luci'!" She clapped her&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-09 00:21:40	@DeliciousLucius &lt;hands and let out a high whistle, imitating a dog owner. Trying so hard to contain her laughter.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-09 00:29:58	@DeliciousLucius She grabbed him by the collar if his shirt and pulled him back violently. She got her tip toes, hissing in his ear. "Don't&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-09 00:30:17	@DeliciousLucius &lt;call me that word..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-09 00:37:53	@DeliciousLucius "Yes!" She pushed him a bit hard.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-09 00:41:24	@DeliciousLucius "Stupid dude!" She was angry now as she stomped ahead of him.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-09 00:44:09	@DeliciousLucius //Okay.

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-09 01:48:24	Rickie rubbed her temples, mumbling. "I need coffee..."

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-09 03:19:14	"You don't...just..just jump off a roof and scare somebody and not expect them to slam you into a brick wall!" Rickie then began pouting.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-09 03:26:49	"You ever meet someone so pretty you wanna punch them in the face?"

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 20:20:23	"I strike back." http://t.co/SiI7kX616l
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 16:40:19	Rickie trudged down the sidewalk, rain hitting against her face. "The one time I decide not to bring an umbrella!" She then began mumbling&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 16:40:43	@TheRickieDeval &lt;curses under her breath.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 21:10:14	Rickie's hair blew in the cold November air and it flew into her face. "Stop it!" She yelled to the wind as (cont) http://t.co/pUipEtw5fc

Rickie now sat on the grass in the front lawn, tears streaming freely down her face. ["What&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 21:42:36	@TheRickieDeval &lt;happened?"] She thought to herself. She needed to learn to control this blacking out stuff. She slowly stood then it hit&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 21:43:24	@TheRickieDeval &lt;her, as she wiped the tears away. "Ronnie...!" She turned toward the front door and froze. Two men lay there...motionless.&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 21:44:19	@TheRickieDeval &lt;one's body sprawled the over the stairs the other just a few steps away from the steps. Rickie let out a faint gasp.&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 21:45:03	@TheRickieDeval &lt;Had she done that? No. Impossible. She wouldn't do that..Never. It was becoming harder to convince herself. Rickie looked&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 21:46:10	@TheRickieDeval &lt;around. There must've of been witnesses of what had happened but there was no sign anyone had. Rickie wanted to go inside&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 21:46:56	@TheRickieDeval &lt;to see if there was any slight chance that Ronnie might still be alive but her head screamed. ["Run!"] So she did. Rickie&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 21:48:24	@TheRickieDeval  &lt;took off down the sidewalk, the tears coming down her cheeks faster blurring her vision. She was a monster...

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 21:55:39	I can see what's happening.
"What?"
And they don't have a clue.
"Who?"
They'll fall in love in here's the bottom line, our trios down to two
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 22:05:40	Rickie sat in an alley, on a dumpster while hugging her knees. Still crying..like a child. She wanted to slap herself and tell herself to&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 22:06:32	@TheRickieDeval &lt;suck it up, but she couldn't. She was afraid. Not only of what had happened to her boss, Ronnie, but also...of herself.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 22:13:12	"Barbie's back. Great." She said, obviously sarcasm tinged her voice.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 22:15:17	Sits back with a bucket of popcorn, getting ready for Kara and Tim's argument to start...again.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 22:28:35	Rickie holds her phone up, playing dramatic music. "I don't know who I'm cheering for here!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-06 22:32:13	"Supergirl vs. Red Robin. Who wins?"

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 00:03:54	"Is a guy that's a giant Bat!? Or...does he have a lot of bats so....um."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 00:06:06	@FabledJinx "Oh...it's a hero?" Rickie frowned. "I thought it was a guy with a lot of bats!!!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 00:07:33	"I shall seek this.." She said the name slowly. "Batman...out and ask him if he owns a bat...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 00:08:05	@FabledJinx Her eyes brightened. "Cave!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 00:10:22	@FabledJinx Rickie stood in silence for a moment then said with confidence. "....I'm gonna find it."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 00:14:08	"I ship them so hard!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 00:16:33	@FabledJinx "You don't think I can find it?" A light smirk formed on her lips.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 00:17:25	"Little tush....? 

Um..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 00:18:35	@FabledJinx "Just because other people can't find it, does not mean /I/ can't!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 00:20:26	@FabledJinx "Hmm..." A little unsure, she answered. "Alright."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-07 00:25:24	@FabledJinx Rickie laughed, holding her hand out for Jinx to shake. "Deal!"

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 20:54:50	@TheRickieDeval &lt;past her. "....partially."

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 21:10:40	@DeliciousLucius "Um..I'm Rickie?" She said questionably. "And I have no idea."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 21:16:04	@DeliciousLucius Rickie didn't know what to say as she stared at him, speechless.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 21:21:19	@DeliciousLucius Rickie nodded slowly as she spoke. "Um..sure."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 21:27:34	@DeliciousLucius She took a step back, crossing her arms. Her mood had totally flipped as it did usually. "No, the question is, what do you&gt;
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 21:28:12	@DeliciousLucius &lt;want from me, mister Lucius?" Her eyes narrowed as she stared up at him.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 21:39:34	@DeliciousLucius Her eyes darted around before focusing back on him. "What do you want, Lucius..?"

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-08 22:09:19	@DeliciousLucius "Defiantly not!" She poked his chest with her index finger. "You don't even know me!"

Didn't end well, though.

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-10 01:12:38	Rickie sat at a local bar, drinking a gin and tonic. She had not had a good day. This morning, Rickie had (cont) http://t.co/4r898AQW8y

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-10 02:49:51	"He's going to end up getting hurt.."

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-14 18:50:33	"...four days. Four days with that maniac and nobody knew." Rickie pinched the bridge of her nose. "Not maniac." She paused. "..my friend."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-14 18:52:17	"Please don't tempt me to go /beast/ mode on you." She snorted at her joke, herself being the only one who got it. http://t.co/68wUpNscoj
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 01:30:21	@TheRickieDeval --come and save her but guess what, no one did. So much for the so called heros of Gotham. Then oddly enough, Rickie awoke--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 01:31:34	@TheRickieDeval --completely co-operational. /They/ trained her.../they/ helped her. Why'd she even wanna leave in the first place? She--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 01:32:33	@TheRickieDeval --didn't know. All she knew was she had a new boss...a boss who would help her find her purpose in this world.--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 01:32:55	@TheRickieDeval --/He/ always knew how to put a smile on her face...

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 01:35:20	"That's it!" Rickie through her hands in the air. "You're dead!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 01:55:36	"I like the noise you make when you shut the fuck up."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 02:04:28	@_MusicMeister "If you don't shut your mouth, you're going to find my knee down south!" She balled her fists.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 03:03:39	@PreciseBatgirl "And why is that? I can do as I please."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 03:04:24	@MrSuperiority She stared down at him. "I don't have a...deal."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 03:05:32	@PreciseBatgirl Cass just stared at her, processing why she had been called a...rugrat.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 03:06:36	@MrSuperiority "Did I smack you yet!? No. So I have not gotten pissy yet!!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 03:11:32	@PreciseBatgirl "Then I'm not attending." She turned on her heels and starts off.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 03:15:21	@MrSuperiority "Smartass..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 03:16:18	"I feel as if I may be guilt tripped into this dinner."

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 03:41:43	"Grayson being...well Grayson, again." Cass crosses her arms.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 03:50:58	"I need no one nor does anyone need me." http://t.co/M4LyxNMNmh
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 03:55:33	@AcrobatGrayson Cass rolled her eyes. "Here to lecture me on my importance, Grayson?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 03:55:56	@HarlandHammer "Release me...or I snapp your neck."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 03:57:14	@HarlandHammer Luckily Cass was strong so she could hold him up. "Never."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 03:58:03	@AcrobatGrayson "Your happiness annoys me..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 03:58:33	@HarlandHammer "I will rip your tongue out!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:00:58	"My father raised me...trained me, as a weapon...not even bothering to teach me to /speak/..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:01:34	@AcrobatGrayson She grumbled. "A dysfunctional one..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:05:11	@AcrobatGrayson She stayed silent for a while before responding. "Whatever, Dick."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:08:17	@Gothams_TruHero Cassandra had been in the cave for quite some time. On the Bat computer, looking through files on a case before she'd+
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:09:21	@Gothams_TruHero +heard Bruce. She spun in the chair, facing him. "What's going on?" She asked in curiosity not her usual sarcasm.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:10:03	@AcrobatGrayson "Aren't you always right?" She said grouchily.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:12:23	"Stupid Grayson always gets a spot near Bruce! I need attention too!
I mean...
I don't even care~" http://t.co/lhKKTCbYH1
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:13:23	@Gothams_TruHero She quickly hopped up from the chair. "Need help!?" She asked again eagerly.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:14:27	@AcrobatGrayson Her expression softened but then went back to being grumpy. "Whatever..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:15:32	@UpInSpotlight "Oh...my...gosh. Release me you foul creature." Cass said trying to escape his hug.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:15:58	@AcrobatGrayson "Defiantly not, you creature."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:17:59	"Grayson's hugs are not pleasant nor enjoyable. 
Trust me, I know.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:18:42	@AcrobatGrayson She took a step back. "Away, demon!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:19:38	@Gothams_TruHero Cass narrowed her eyes, jogging up beside him. "I wanna help, Bruce!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:21:23	@AcrobatGrayson Cass let out a groan, just letting him hug her. "I will end you.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:23:54	@AcrobatGrayson She wiped her cheek. "Ew! Don't do that!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:26:15	@AcrobatGrayson She huffed. "Stupid dude.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:27:04	@Gothams_TruHero Her eyes widened. "Really?" She was excited now, running to go get her suit on.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:30:03	@AcrobatGrayson Cass ran her hand over her face. "Look, Grayson...I know, okay? I know everyone cares..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:31:12	"I'm getting pretty sick and tired of getting lectured."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:32:16	@AcrobatGrayson "Sometimes...I just...I wanna be my own person without everyone telling me what to do and how to do it!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:34:44	@UpInSpotlight She let out a faint growl. "Hug demon..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:35:08	@AcrobatGrayson "I suppose.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:36:32	".....really tempted to punch Grayson in the mouth....."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:37:21	@RedDeadHood "I realize that now."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:39:28	@Gothams_TruHero Minutes later, Cass came bolting back pulling on her mask. "Ready!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:40:34	@RedDeadHood "He's an unstoppable force, I swear.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:41:25	"Obviously, he will not be getting his Christmas wish."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:42:37	@UpInSpotlight "I was content without your hugs, Grayson! I'm sure Jason needs one though.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:44:06	"Attempt to hug me on Christmas and I throw you out a window~"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:45:07	@UpInSpotlight ".....release me!" She started to wiggle around. "Ugh! What about Damian!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:45:51	"But, nothing."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:46:28	"Damian...you /like/ his hugs though! Take one for the team!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:47:21	@RedDeadHood "I have witnessed his cereal high before. Trust me, I know..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:48:31	@UpInSpotlight "....." As soon as he had released her, she took off running.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:48:58	@RedDeadHood "Hmm. Sounds terrible."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:53:08	@RedDeadHood "Dammit...that would have been entertaining to watch!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:54:14	"Two Grayson's on the TL.

Is this what hell is like?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 04:56:25	@Gothams_TruHero "Wait!" Cass yelled, waving her arms.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 05:00:46	"I don't fight fair....
....I fight to win." http://t.co/PajvN9xJlN
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 05:01:59	@RedDeadHood She rose a brow. "Is that so?" Cass snickered, folding her arms over her chest.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 05:06:25	"There is no trust in GA and I's friendship!" http://t.co/EDkHoEPwip
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 05:24:27	"I like a challenge....
...I Am Legend zombies!!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 05:25:23	@Gothams_TruHero "What's going on...?" She murmured, leaning forward in the seat.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 05:29:03	"This is why you don't take your eyes off the road~
Men can't drive...I swear."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 05:30:32	@Gothams_TruHero "Holy shit!" Cass exclaimed. "Let me out! We have to investigate.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 05:34:31	"Grayson, I am far more superior than you with a sword.
Don't push it, DickyBird."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 05:35:28	@Gothams_TruHero Cass cringed at the man making contact as he lands. "....gotta be the Joker."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 05:39:20	Sighs heavily at the memories..... http://t.co/U7gPTlmXDi
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 05:40:19	"Jason, please hit him."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 05:56:36	"Grayson got slapped." Cass bursts into laughter. "Thank you, lord!!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 11:49:40	@AcrobatGrayson "I swear if I wake up and I've been kidnapped......you're dead, Grayson."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 11:53:52	@AcrobatGrayson She sat there silently for a moment. "I'd find a way..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 11:57:17	@AcrobatGrayson She swatted at his hand. "No touchy.." She faced away from him, curling into a ball. "Go on now, Grayson, I'll be here..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:01:00	@RenegadeRobin "Just shut up, Jason.." She grumbled.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:03:27	"Hello, people.." http://t.co/FcuN9nvXkA
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:05:43	"Cassie makes me sound like a five year old...
....call me Cass."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:07:30	@Gothams_TruHero Cass was on high alert. "Upstairs!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:08:30	"That's better, Grayson. 
Good boy."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:09:48	@BatOfWayne Out of no where, Cassie sprinted over to Bruce. "Whatcha' doing?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:11:47	"Whatever, Richard."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:12:31	@BatOfWayne "Any as of late?" She looked at the computer, over his shoulder.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:14:45	@AcrobatGrayson @mrvl_X_23_ "............I am superior." Walks away trying not to attack Grayson.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:16:10	@BatOfWayne "You could tidy up the ole' cave."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:17:19	@AcrobatGrayson @mrvl_X_23_ "Ew! Ew! Ew!" She ran out of sight.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:20:48	@BatOfWayne "I'm just trying to give you something to do, Bruce.." She grumbled.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:24:43	@BatOfWayne "Spar? With you...? Uhm...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:29:23	@BatOfWayne "I could still take you down if you weren't going easy!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:32:41	@BatOfWayne "You're going down, old man!" Cass joked as she backed up some.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:33:48	"Do not underestimate me just because I am a woman. I could still kick your ass, one arm tied behind my back!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:35:30	@BatOfWayne "Ugh!" Cassie darted toward the stage.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:41:11	She grinned widely. "Vroom, vroom..." http://t.co/VUisWHWdMl
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:44:53	@BatOfWayne "Whatever, Bruce! I'm taking you down!" She hopped up and down.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:45:19	@AcrobatGrayson "Better than your car." She crossed her arms, snickering.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:45:56	@TrueBeetle @AcrobatGrayson "None of /your/ business."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:49:09	@AcrobatGrayson "Shut up, Dick.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:49:26	@AcrobatGrayson @TrueBeetle "....." She began pouting.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:50:54	@AcrobatGrayson She tried to resist a smile. "I said shut up, you demon."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:52:03	@BatOfWayne Cassie hesitated but then started toward him in a sprint, letting out a battle cry as she tried to knock him off his feet.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:52:24	@AcrobatGrayson @TrueBeetle Cass grumbled but shuffled toward him.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:54:05	@TrueBeetle @AcrobatGrayson "What!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:54:40	@BatOfWayne She let out a little scream as she hit the floor with a thud. "...ow."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:56:09	@AcrobatGrayson @TrueBeetle "I hate you." She murmured.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:56:26	@TrueBeetle @AcrobatGrayson "My name is /Cassandra/."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:58:01	@BatOfWayne Cass quickly swept her leg across the ground and kicked his feet from under him. "HA!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 20:58:46	@AcrobatGrayson @TrueBeetle "I will suffocate you with a pillow in your sleep..." She continued to let him hug her.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:00:48	@AcrobatGrayson @TrueBeetle "I've always wanted to break your face over a brick wall..." She relaxed against him.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:01:45	@BatOfWayne Cass let out a painful groan, failing to block his knee.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:02:59	@AcrobatGrayson @TrueBeetle "I wanna shoot you in the face with a dart gun..." She mumbled.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:04:32	@BatOfWayne She growled in frustration, getting back to her feet quickly and started to trow a flurry of punches at Bruce. Her anger+
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:04:45	@BatOfWayne +getting the best of her.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:05:14	@TrueBeetle @AcrobatGrayson "If he tried to hug me, I would rip his head off, Grayson.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:06:44	@TrueBeetle @AcrobatGrayson "I have my ways..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:06:54	@AcrobatGrayson "For now I am..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:09:14	@BatOfWayne She just laid there, staring up at the ceiling. "....dammit."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:09:34	@AcrobatGrayson She nodded a bit.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:12:03	@AcrobatGrayson She narrowed her eyes. "Me, tense? Never!!!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:14:29	@AcrobatGrayson "How about I massage your face with my fists!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:15:37	Debating on whether or not to create an Ask.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:18:06	"My strengths are your weaknesses." http://t.co/NgQpAMMn6S

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:36:08	@BatOfWayne +hugged back
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:36:33	@AcrobatGrayson She hadn't meant to be so harsh toward him but she would never admit that. "....fine."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:37:33	@BatOfWayne "It's fine, Bruce." She tightened the hug.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:39:49	@AcrobatGrayson She huffed and stomped after him, wrapping her arms around him. "I love you, Grayson, even though you are like+
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:40:11	@AcrobatGrayson +an annoying older brother..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:41:31	@BatOfWayne She tried to hide her smile, Bruce had been the father figure in her life for a while now and to hear those words was amazing.

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:53:52	@AcrobatGrayson She grumbled. "I mean, I don't even care..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:54:09	@BatOfWayne "Sure." She gave a bright smile.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:56:14	@AcrobatGrayson "Do not." She turned and walked away.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 21:56:49	@BatOfWayne She folded her hands behind her back, the smile still plastered on her face.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 22:06:04	@BatOfWayne She darted up the stairs after him. "Wait up!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 22:13:37	@BatOfWayne She reached the top, laughing.

Ever.
Whatever, I'll go back to training or something..." Stomps off.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:18:42	Cassie started pouting. "Babs, beat up Grayson...he's making fun of my smile." She made a puppy dog face, trying to look all innocent.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:19:32	@AcrobatGrayson "You shut up."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:22:58	@AcrobatGrayson She brought her index finger up to her lips. "Shh..."

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:27:50	"Except Bruce.
I can't beat Bruce up.." She grumbled in slight disappointment. 
"One day..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:30:03	"Me and Bruce? Evenly matched?" Cass smirked at the thought, she'd always wanted to be like Bruce...but evenly matched? Psshh. She+
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:31:09	@TheBlackBatCain +shrugged the thought away."Nah, the old man could still kick my ass.." She laughed slightly. "But soon..I'll be the best."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:34:55	"Because I am the victorious one!" Cass hopped up and down. "Muwhahahaha!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:37:12	"I could take Jason down...." She said in a low, raspy voice.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:39:45	"....I can take you all down...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:41:43	"Come at me, Babs!" Cass said hopping around playfully.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:45:22	Cass puts her headphones in her ears, done with the conversation /because/ she already knew she was the best.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:50:57	@PreciseBatgirl "Not ready, not ready!" Cass cried out as she collapsed to the ground, laughing for some reason.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:52:22	Going to form alliance with Babs and take down the rest of the 'fam' then.....take her down myself!
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:53:32	@PreciseBatgirl Cass turned quickly and pounced on Barbra. "Never have mercy on your opponent!" But she didn't do a move..she simply+
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:53:50	@PreciseBatgirl +got off of Barbra and stood up, brushing herself off.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:55:28	"Merciless."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:55:47	"I feel like attacking Grayson..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 01:57:20	@PreciseBatgirl Cass landed on the ground with a loud thud, glaring at Babs playfully. "...watch it there, red."

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:11:02	Tenses up as Stephanie hugs her. "I should break your arms, but I won't...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:11:48	@AcrobatGrayson "....." She stood there actually wanting the hug.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:12:21	"I see....Val, right?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:13:22	"GRAYSON! IF YOU ARE GOING ON PATROL, TAKE ME~

I mean, if you want...I don't care."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:13:58	"I feel as if you're hitting on me~"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:14:22	"Ugh...yes you are, Stephanie."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:15:06	@AcrobatGrayson "You're lucky I'm forced to love you..." She muttered.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:15:52	"................idiots. 
Idiots everywhere."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:16:45	@AcrobatGrayson "That's enough!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:20:00	@AcrobatGrayson "Your hugs suck." She says rather harshly.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:20:40	Squints eyes at Stephanie but then bursts into laughter.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:22:36	"You're either with me or against me.

And trust me, my friend, you don't wanna be against /me/..." http://t.co/oKz57yZWLQ
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:23:12	@AcrobatGrayson "No."She said stomping off.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:23:58	"Ugh....Val dude....do you want a hug?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:24:20	"Whatever, Steph!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:25:33	@AcrobatGrayson "Changed my mind!" She called back. "You're too /lame/."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:27:47	"New Rule; No patrolling with Grayson...
....he talks too much. Urges to push him off tall buildings too high."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:28:38	@AcrobatGrayson "Nope!" She snickered.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:29:05	"Steph."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:31:17	@AcrobatGrayson She heard his running and took off. "Go on, Grayson!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:32:02	"That's what you /always/ say."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:33:22	@AcrobatGrayson "I'm telling Bruce!" She whined, trying to keep ahead.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:35:20	@AcrobatGrayson She tried stopping but collided against him, "....I hate you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:38:02	@AcrobatGrayson She made pouty face. "....this is embarrassing."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:38:33	"@UpInSpotlight: .............."

"......." Hugs him then walks away.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:39:56	"......I am the /second/ Batgirl.....not THIRD!!!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:40:35	@AcrobatGrayson "I will end you in your sleep..." She grumbled.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:41:54	"Don't mention it.
Really...don't...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:44:22	"Was it green smoke?
DON'T BREATHE.
/DON'T BREATHE/!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:47:26	@RenegadeRobin "For Babs? Yeah, that's me.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:49:00	"If he starts laughing hysterically~"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:50:02	@AcrobatGrayson "Shot gun!" She dove into the car.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:50:34	@RenegadeRobin  "I know who you are, idiot." She snickered.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:51:54	@AcrobatGrayson "I realize that now..." She put her seatbelt on.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:53:03	@RenegadeRobin "Jason Todd? Be nice to 'lil ole' me?" She said in a rather sarcastic tone.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:54:02	"You think, Stephanie!?

 GOSH!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:55:51	@AcrobatGrayson She gave him a look. "I'll be fine."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:59:01	@RenegadeRobin Her eyes narrowed. "Call me Cassandra, I insist, crowbar boy." Cass remembered Bruce talking about Jason's death and--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 07:59:31	@RenegadeRobin --well...that's the best she could come up with.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:00:23	@AcrobatGrayson "S-..Slow down!" She screamed, gripping the seat.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:00:55	"Todd started it."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:01:59	"Gladly."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:02:34	@AcrobatGrayson "You're psychotic..." She said shaking.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:05:37	@AcrobatGrayson "No...keep going...I'll be fine."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:08:02	@AcrobatGrayson "Ew!!" She hit his chest. "So gross!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:10:50	@AcrobatGrayson "Nasty.."She crossed her arms, looking out the window.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:12:21	@AcrobatGrayson "Eh..." She whined.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:14:49	@AcrobatGrayson She stayed seated. "Nope..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:15:36	"STEPHANIE, I AM GOING TO RIP YOUR TONGUE OUT!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:16:40	@AcrobatGrayson "I wanna go home..." She started pouting again.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:18:22	@AcrobatGrayson Cass let out a soft yawn and curled into a ball. She then started talking like a baby, just for kicks. "Big brotha'...--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:18:40	@AcrobatGrayson --Cassie wanna go home..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:19:07	"No kiss for you!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:20:22	"I am adorable when I try...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-24 08:21:16	@AcrobatGrayson She began whining. "Grayson...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 11:05:45	@SacredSpoiler "........" She let out a low growl. "Stephanie Brown....you are..." She grabbed her arm, slamming her into a wall. "Dead!!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 11:10:46	@RenegadeRobin "Wish I could say the same.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 11:11:48	@SacredSpoiler Cassie's hand moved to Steph's throat. "Don't ever do that again.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 11:13:56	"I did not.
Do it again...you'll find my Katana at your throat."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 11:16:36	@SacredSpoiler "I'm glad we've come to an understanding." She let the woman go and walked away.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 11:18:01	"Whatever."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 11:21:40	"No! I said no and I mean no!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 11:22:49	"The weather is irritating me."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 11:26:20	"It is not a positive maybe! Steph', I don't feel like kicking your ass right now but....keep talking....see what happens.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 11:27:05	"You see...I don't want any kind of relationship! Geez!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 11:28:51	"Gotta go...important business today..."

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 11:29:09	@SacredSpoiler "I could..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 15:57:13	"Battlesgiving sounds epic...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 16:01:54	"People hate you too, Todd."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 16:05:54	"Keep telling yourself that."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 16:09:58	@FabledHood "A problem? Oh, no, of course not!" She said rather sarcastically.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 16:13:46	@FabledHood Cass then said between gritted teeth. "How 'bout I shove my boot up your...." She stopped herself. "...I will fuck you /up/."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 16:15:08	@ChocolateSupes "If you say so..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 16:16:44	@ChocolateSupes "I'm fine...and you, man of Krypton?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 16:22:11	"I raided @AcrobatGrayson's room while he was on patrol....
......you really like painting, don't you?" She snickered.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 16:24:59	@FabledHood "You are disgusting." She turned on her heels, walking away.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 16:27:58	"Too tired to move.." http://t.co/2eBEmcPanM
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 16:59:09	@AcrobatGrayson "Don't talk to you?" Her brow furrowed.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 17:02:20	@AcrobatGrayson Cass scoffed and then jumped on Grayson's back. "You don't want that."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 17:07:48	@AcrobatGrayson She rested her chin on his shoulder. "What'd I do..?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 17:11:38	@AcrobatGrayson "...." She made a pouty face. "That was an accident..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 17:16:34	@AcrobatGrayson "Richard, I'm sorry..." She mumbled, the words leaving a bad taste in her mouth.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 17:19:59	@AcrobatGrayson "And you did a good job...I was being a bitch.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 17:25:36	@AcrobatGrayson She stayed silent, staring at the crumpled piece of paper.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 17:28:19	@AcrobatGrayson "But you worked hard on it..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 17:31:56	@AcrobatGrayson She hopped down from his back and gave him a hug, staying quiet.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 17:37:57	@AcrobatGrayson "Are you mad at me..?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 17:42:08	@AcrobatGrayson She kept hugging him. "Promise?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 17:43:14	"If I hug you, you better feel damn special!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 17:46:02	@AcrobatGrayson "...you could make another one..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-25 23:41:58	"If you ask for my opinion, I'm not going to soften it up for you.
I'm gonna' tell you like it is. Don't like it, suck it up."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 18:47:43	Cass sat in the cave, just sitting in the middle of the sparring platform....
She was evaluating herself and her recent attitude.+
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 18:48:57	@TheBlackBatCain +She let out a frustrated breath collapsing on her back. "I shouldn't change just because people are too /sensitive/..."+
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 18:49:11	@TheBlackBatCain She grumbled.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 19:05:02	@GothamBestMayor "Women are not worries!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 19:40:33	@AcrobatGrayson "That's amazing, Richard!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 19:45:27	@AcrobatGrayson "I'm serious, Grayson.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 03:57:45	@BatOfWayne @SacredSpoiler Cass waltzed in the cave, her hands shoved in her sweatshirt pockets. Her usual attitude showing. "Sup, /Daddy/."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 20:55:03	"Talk to me in the wrong way and I'll punch your teeth down your throat."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 04:16:31	@AcrobatGrayson "...................." She took her piece of gum out of her mouth the stuck it on the portrait then walked off.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:02:14	@KidWally_West Cass had been making her usual round around the city, making sure nothing inparticular was going on. She then spotted the+
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:03:06	@KidWally_West +and didn't recognize him, she snuck up behind him and wrapped her arm around his neck from behind. "Who are you?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:04:58	@KidWally_West She quickly released him, "Kid Flash? What are you doing here?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:06:07	"I don't try to act adorable.
It comes naturally."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:08:45	"I get the job done.." http://t.co/fqORRzxZmN
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:09:46	@KidWally_West "This is my turf..." She crossed her arms. "....you could be a threat."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:11:21	@KidWally_West "You know what!" She didn't want to admit he was wrong. "I should snap your arm!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:13:20	@KidWally_West She quickly launched back and elbowed him in the face. "Sure 'bout that, Speedy?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:15:26	"I need help....
....gotta get rid of a certain kid named Wally..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:16:25	@KidWally_West She spun on her heels, her hand on her hip. "I would try and break some of your bones but I don't want to waste my time on+
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:19:08	@KidWally_West "Scared to lose? No. I just don't want to end up...killing you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:22:11	@KidWally_West "Not a problem...but cause some trouble...I'll be the last thing you see!" Her eyes narrowed as she hopped from the roof.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:29:49	"...just no." http://t.co/GXYVPyo2qZ
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:32:00	@TrueBeetle "I would end one of them."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:34:59	@TrueBeetle "Irritating!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:39:02	@TrueBeetle "Everyone is." She crossed her arms.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-27 03:17:05	"I am a nightmare who looks like a daydream~"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-27 03:42:47	@BatOfWayne @SacredSpoiler "Hmm?" Cass hesitantly walked toward the sparring stage.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:43:16	@TrueBeetle "Stop annoying me with your questioning. I do not need to answer to you.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:44:49	"I fight for what /I/ think is right.." http://t.co/gSFfgCFu3F
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:46:06	"Damian giving you problems, Al'?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:47:34	"The one time Joker tells a good joke...HA!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:48:22	".......I could smack him a couple times if you'd like." She grinned deviously.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:50:03	@TrueBeetle "How 'bout I shut /you/ up?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:52:01	@TrueBeetle She scoffed. "Why would I waste my time on you?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 21:53:13	@TrueBeetle "Grayson would kill you if you touch me..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 22:15:03	"The only hugs I like are from Bruce.
And that happens very rarely..." Cass huffed, crossing her arms.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 22:16:12	"And Alfred.
Alfred hugs are fine too."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 22:17:16	"Hey, Green Arrow, guess what."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 22:18:05	"........you ruined the joke, old man."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 22:19:41	"Yeah...okay. Whatever you say, GA."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 22:20:13	"I can be funny..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 22:23:08	"......pfff....maybe one hug..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 22:23:39	"Don't talk to me, I'm irritated with you and blue boy now."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 22:24:25	@TrueBeetle "Problem?" She snapped.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 22:27:37	"Stop bitching at me, I can do what I want."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 22:30:48	"You keep quiet!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-27 04:28:55	"I see psycho blonde is back."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-27 04:29:27	@BatOfWayne @SacredSpoiler "Bruce...."Cass hesitated. "....fine."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-27 04:31:34	@BatOfWayne @SacredSpoiler "I'm not!" She snapped. "Stephanie, hurry your ass up!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-27 04:33:09	"Jason has women stashed in his safe houses~?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-27 04:33:46	Blinks.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-27 04:37:43	Laughing because Cisco 'bout to die.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 22:45:45	"I demand cookies."

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 22:48:50	"He hugged me because guess what, he cares about me!" Cass started pouting. "Is it bad to hug me!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 23:03:34	"Wait? 
WHO HURT YOU RICHARD!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 23:05:39	".....well, someone's dying today."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 23:09:21	"Ew..
Don't make me rip your tongue out of your mouth."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-26 23:12:29	@AcrobatGrayson "That word is forbidden. I tolerate you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-27 05:13:57	@SacredSpoiler @BatOfWayne Cass took in a deep breath, "You good?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-27 05:28:38	@AcrobatGrayson @RedDeadHood @SonOfBman // Of freakin' course I'd be in it. Hah'.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-27 07:00:16	@SacredSpoiler @BatOfWayne "Captain?" She snorted.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-28 07:27:31	@AcrobatGrayson [.....you must be desperate for someone to /hang/ with, huh?]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-28 07:29:32	@AcrobatGrayson [Oh, well...my feelings are hurt now. Ouch.]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-28 07:30:35	@AcrobatGrayson [Because I looovveee you.]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-28 07:32:33	@AcrobatGrayson [I love you. -_-]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-28 07:34:47	@AcrobatGrayson [Whatever. Didn't want to come anyway.]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-28 07:37:11	@AcrobatGrayson [No. Bye.]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-28 07:38:07	@AcrobatGrayson [I don't want to.]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-28 07:40:28	@AcrobatGrayson Cass didn't respond just took the phone battery out, done.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-27 07:01:14	"What the hell is going on?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:09:25	@AcrobatGrayson "Fine. Get the fuck out of my face before I punch you in yours."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:23:31	@AcrobatGrayson "Pff. I don't care." She placed her hand on her hip. "Choose for me Grayson, I don't give a damn."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:32:05	@AcrobatGrayson The tear of the paper made Cass gasp. [He just....he tore them...] "You fucking quitter! I hate you!" Her eyes welled--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:32:36	@AcrobatGrayson --with tears. "I fucking hate you!" She turned and ran off.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 20:01:50	@AcrobatGrayson Cass wasn't expecting the push and fell to the ground, staring at him blankly.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 20:05:43	@AcrobatGrayson She scrambled to her feet. "Don't you ever fucking touch me, look at me or even breathe in my direction again! Go!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 20:17:28	@AcrobatGrayson Cass' fists started to hit against his chest. "Go! Just go! You want to!!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 20:21:51	@AcrobatGrayson Cass struggled against him. "You're a quitter!!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 20:24:09	@AcrobatGrayson She just gave up trying to escape. "No...those words never left my mouth."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 20:26:28	@AcrobatGrayson "Just let me go!" Cass started struggling again, the tears returning.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 20:28:36	@AcrobatGrayson "Let go!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 20:30:32	@AcrobatGrayson She rested her forehead against his chest. "Stupid..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 20:32:25	@AcrobatGrayson She just stood there. "You tore them up.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 20:35:08	@AcrobatGrayson "...." She stayed silent.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 20:38:18	@AcrobatGrayson She wrapped her arms around him tightly, still not talking.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 20:44:49	@AcrobatGrayson "I'm sorry for pushing you..." She mumbled.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 20:47:05	@AcrobatGrayson She took in a deep breath. "Shut up."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-30 05:17:40	"People now and days~
I laugh at the stupidity, honestly."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-30 06:08:26	"Tim......don't."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-30 06:09:49	"The feeling is /not/ mutual."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-30 06:14:20	"Do not call me babe, kiddo."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-30 06:21:09	Cass grabs Tim by the ear. "I advise you to shut up."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-30 06:22:46	Shoves him away. "Eck..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-30 06:24:40	"Not even acknowledging his existence anymore."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-30 21:04:26	"....I like that jacket. That's all you're gettin'....#SeductiveSunday" http://t.co/vHTVntlo8a
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 07:56:11	"I don't want a casual, surprise, sneak or any kind of hug! 
Get it through your skull."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 07:57:17	@AcrobatGrayson "....." Cass stayed silent for a moment. ".....I was literally a nanosecond from punching you in your throat, right there."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 07:59:04	@AcrobatGrayson "Trying? No, I /was/."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 07:59:43	@WingedCrimson Cass was almost knocked over but stayed standing. "Ew~"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:00:32	@AcrobatGrayson "Is that your purpose in life? Pissing me off?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:01:12	@WingedCrimson "Remove your arms from around me, you vile little creature..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:02:12	@WingedCrimson Her eyes narrowed. "Release me."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:02:57	@SacredSpoiler "You have 'till the count of three...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:03:16	@AcrobatGrayson "I was out."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:03:45	@WingedCrimson "I will snap your wrist, Romeo."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:05:06	@CowledHeroine @WingedCrimson "Get him off...I'm begging you..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:05:46	@AcrobatGrayson "Hmm...I don't care." Her arms crossed.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:06:34	@SacredSpoiler "Get. Off. Now."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:07:20	@WingedCrimson @CowledHeroine She pulled away from him finally. "Little crazy bastard.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:07:50	@AcrobatGrayson "It is not your concern."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:09:23	@CowledHeroine @WingedCrimson Cass huffed. "No more hugging.." She then walked off without another word.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:09:53	@AcrobatGrayson "How about nope." She popped the p.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:10:57	@WingedCrimson @CowledHeroine "No!" She yelled back.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:11:50	Will only accept hugs from Bruce, Grayson, Alfred and Babs.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:12:13	Otherwise she will break a bone in your body.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:12:43	"Kiss me again, I rip your tongue out!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:13:43	"I don't /care/!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:14:26	"You got lucky, Timothy."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:15:14	@AcrobatGrayson She took a step back. "Not your business."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:16:11	"Yeah. Think what you want."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:16:55	"Stephanie, I swear to all that is holy..." Cass made a crushing gesture with her fist, growling.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:17:16	"Timothy."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:18:06	@AcrobatGrayson "What the fuck ever. Worry over someone else..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:18:45	"Someone get him~"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:20:06	@AcrobatGrayson "You're not my father! You can't tell me what to do!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:20:44	"Tim. No."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:22:09	@AcrobatGrayson "....you called me Cassandra not Cassie or Cass.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:23:44	"Maybe if I didn't have a psycho always trying to kiss me.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:24:58	@AcrobatGrayson Her eyes narrowed. [He'll be back...] She turned on her heels walking away. [....maybe.]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:25:44	"@WingedCrimson: //Time to go to bed..... Night guys// And farewell my love! *Blows kiss to cass*"

".......I will break you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:26:57	"Lucky I didn't rip your stupid lips off then!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:31:14	"......Bruce likes my hugs. HA!" http://t.co/qnwq7buQx8
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:31:51	"I didn't so be quiet Stephanie or I will get violent with you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:35:30	Cass pinched the bridge of her nose. "Someone talk to Stephanie before I punch her teeth out."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:36:12	"Good...
....didn't need you anyway."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:40:08	"I can tolerate some people."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:43:54	"Whatever.
I don't care.
Another person gone is no surprise to me." Does a shooing hand gesture. "Bye, bye."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:46:51	@SacredSpoiler Cass pulled away. "That's it!" Cass then tackled Stephanie to the ground and delivered several blows to her face with her+
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:47:13	@SacredSpoiler +fists, having no remorse.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:48:18	@UpInSpotlight Will accept hug but just stands there.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:48:41	"I am /keeping/ it!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:50:24	"I like it.
You'll have to pry it from my /cold/, /dead/ fingers!!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:52:06	@SacredSpoiler Cass then stood up and looked down at the girl. "Next time...I won't stop..." She turned, walking away.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:52:48	"Fine! Kill me! Go ahead!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:55:08	@UpInSpotlight Cass then decided to return the hug but then quickly pulled away. "Happy..?" She muttered.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:56:26	"Actually, yes! You just said you would!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:57:03	@UpInSpotlight "....mhmmm..." She turned on her heels and walked off.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 08:59:40	"Obviously I don't!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 09:00:00	"Finally!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 09:05:40	"Stop trying so hard! I don't need you! I don't..."

I take his life.
Simple."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 09:11:21	"They're /mine/."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 09:17:10	"You gave them to me. Therefore, they are mine!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 09:18:18	"Woman named Bianca.

Shut. Up. Please."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 09:18:56	"Or not!"

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 09:29:32	"Yep.
You're dead, Richard."

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 09:32:55	"I'd like to know why~" http://t.co/UVEJXzcOBN
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 09:33:20	@AcrobatGrayson "No!" She snapped.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 09:35:39	@AcrobatGrayson "D-..Don't..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 09:36:57	@AcrobatGrayson "Because I like them..." Makes grabby hands toward them.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 09:39:53	@AcrobatGrayson "Please..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 16:45:43	"Too tired to deal with people's bullshit today."

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:05:25	@AcrobatGrayson "What gives you the authority to tell me what /I/ deserve!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:11:15	@AcrobatGrayson "If you can't deal with my attitude, go!!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:12:36	"I can't stand people.
God!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:17:06	@AcrobatGrayson "I am done with this conversation.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:20:57	@AcrobatGrayson "I don't have to! You are not my boss!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:36:54	"He gave up on me.
Whatever..
..Bruce would never do that. At least I have one person."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:38:02	"Let me hug you in my time of sadness!!" http://t.co/4cc606ftHU
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:44:09	Ignoring Grayson because temptation to hurt him badly.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:49:33	"You aren't worth attacking anymore, quitter."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:51:52	@AcrobatGrayson "You are wasting my time." She scoffed, turning away from him.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:53:16	@AcrobatGrayson "Still you...quitter."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:55:33	@AcrobatGrayson "Oh, and look at that,  you're still here, caring!" Without warning, she shoved him hard. "Go on!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-11-29 19:57:58	@AcrobatGrayson "I said go! I don't need you!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-01 02:17:16	@AcrobatGrayson @DeadIyClaws "Not me..." Crosses her arms and walks off.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-01 02:24:08	@AcrobatGrayson @DeadIyClaws "I work, patrol alone...so...no."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-01 02:28:07	@AcrobatGrayson @DeadIyClaws "Find someone else." She waved her hand at him in dismissal.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-01 02:35:36	@AcrobatGrayson @DeadIyClaws "Well, you have 'lil miss claws, I think you're all set."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-01 02:49:41	@AcrobatGrayson @DeadIyClaws "I'm not going!"

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-01 03:39:20	@SacredSpoiler "...fine." She grumbled.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-07 23:59:51	//Thinking of flipping this account.
/Again/....\\
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 00:46:28	//Was @TheBlackBatCain. RT?

Well, I mean, besides all the lunatics running around.
Just trying to get the so called /heroes/ attention.--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 00:54:20	@FearsomeThreat --The right way to do it is to keep it low key.
Then you don't get hauled off to Arkahm or..BlackGate." Ella shuddered.--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 00:54:47	@FearsomeThreat --"Such a nasty place, really."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 00:58:20	"...my name is not adorable!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-05 20:09:22	Cass looked at her wrist...
It was in a small cast..on a previous patrol she'd caught sight of a burglary. In pursuit of the three large--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-05 20:10:43	@TheBlackBatCain --men. Eventually, she had pounced on one but then they'd taken control. She could've easily taken them down but--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-05 20:11:29	@TheBlackBatCain --something was off. Things happened and now...she was stuck with a broken wrist. As soon as Bruce had found out he had--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-05 20:12:21	@TheBlackBatCain --scolded her.
"Pff...at least he doesn't have a broken wrist." She muttered to herself, looking out her bedroom window.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 21:06:34	Talia furrowed her brow. "I did /not/ raise /that/." She sneered in disgust.

2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 21:36:47	"You smell...like a homeless man."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 21:37:35	"Excuse you, Super Pest?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 21:39:10	@ChocolateSupes Talia just stared at the man for a while then swooshes her hand at him. "Away."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 21:42:01	@ChocolateSupes She was amused that he had bowed. "I am Talia Al Ghul..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 21:45:39	@ChocolateSupes "You know of me?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 21:47:13	"Eck. There are too many toddlers running around."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 21:48:24	@ChocolateSupes "Very smart man." Her arms crossed over her chest, raising her chin arrogantly.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 21:52:44	@ChocolateSupes "Are you flirting with me?" Her eyes narrowed.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 21:53:32	".....he acts like that man Grayson."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 21:59:19	@ChocolateSupes "Do not flirt with me." Her tone was stale and flat.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:07:04	@ChocolateSupes "Because.." She flashed a quick smile. "...I will decapitate you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:07:53	"I /am/ nice.
What are you talking about, idiot?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:09:25	@ChocolateSupes She hesitated and studied him for a while. "...what /are/ you?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:11:40	"Hnn..I think this is my regular bitchiness, Todd."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:15:20	"Me and my fellow /baddies/ as people call them." http://t.co/DwjFTSiezK
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:15:57	@ChocolateSupes "What are you!?" She demanded, ignoring his words.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:17:41	@ChocolateSupes "Just tell me, you oversized monkey!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:18:23	@Jester_Quinn @FabledArrow "You should be." Talia's hands rested on her hips.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:19:59	@FabledArrow "Nutbag? I do not think so."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:20:28	@ChocolateSupes She took a few steps back. "Away!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:20:58	@Jester_Quinn "Oh, yeah? I do not care, Harley."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:22:05	"....." Talia just shrugs.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:23:25	@FabledArrow Talia clenched her fist, her eyes narrowing at the man. "I don't have time for your irrelevance, Green Arrow."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:24:32	"Santa Al Ghul?

What the /hell/ is wrong with you!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:27:45	@FabledArrow She scoffed. "Imbecile." Talia turned on her heels, walking away.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:30:45	@ChocolateSupes "I want to know what you are."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:31:54	"Does the man need someone else winning his arguments /for/ him?
So sad.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:38:19	"He looks well into his fifties, in my opinion." Shrugs casually, snickers.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 22:45:55	"Cross me and you suffer the consequences. 
Take that as a warning." http://t.co/OrJ1gW1eP8
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:05:14	"Ahh', the memories!" http://t.co/UwqTam0ms7
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:11:19	@TheLegendaryBat "/Damian/ will soon realize he belongs with /me/ in the league." Talia's arms folded over her chest. "Do not refer to--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:11:37	@TheLegendaryBat --him as /that boy/."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:16:06	@TheLegendaryBat "Why can you not accept that Damian is meant to be in the league? He is the heir to a great association!" She was trying--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:16:59	@TheLegendaryBat --to make it sound better than it was. "...Damian is a leader. Strong, powerful and capable of the responsibility!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:21:00	@ChocolateSupes Her eyes flared with excitement, smirking evilly. "Then this shall be easy..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:22:15	@TheLegendaryBat "He will return to the league.." Her tone was like ice. "...he knows where he belongs."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:22:43	@ChocolateSupes "Taking /you/ down."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:23:53	@ChocolateSupes "Do not doubt me, boy!" She raised her voice.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:25:08	@TheLegendaryBat "Do not fight with me on this! He is old enough to make his own choices!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:27:01	@TheLegendaryBat She let out a low growl. "You doubt that I can teach him myself?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:30:09	@TheLegendaryBat "You are blind to what he needs. He /needs/ his mother!" She poked her index finger into his chest.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:33:14	@TheLegendaryBat "I am done arguing with you, Bruce." Her hands folded behind her back. "Let the boy make his own decisions, he does not--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:33:49	@TheLegendaryBat --need to be babied." She turned on her heels, walking away.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:37:23	@TheLegendaryBat She stopped, her head turning slightly. "Trouble? What kind of trouble?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:40:04	@TheLegendaryBat "/Now/ you wish for my help?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:41:34	@TheLegendaryBat She was now facing him completely. "Of course I would."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:44:55	@TheLegendaryBat "Alright. Fine. But Damian will suspect something is up when he finds out I am being humane toward you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-08 23:49:04	@TheLegendaryBat She gave a slight nod before marching off.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 00:13:55	"I may be a lot of things but an unfit mother is not one of them!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 00:19:28	"Father, please..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 00:21:35	@FabledDemon "I know..." Talia's eyes fell to the ground.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 00:24:56	@FabledDemon "I understand that." Her voice rose slightly, her frustration rising. "You must do what is best for the league."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 00:30:17	@FabledDemon She pondered over this for a while. "...you are right, father. He does not love me, he is the enemy."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 00:36:02	@FabledDemon "He will always be an Al Ghul.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 00:38:03	@FabledDemon "You want me..." Her eyes grew wide. "Father, I can not!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 00:41:53	@FabledDemon Her jaw tensed. "No."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 00:43:27	@FabledDemon She turned away. "I will not be a part of this...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 00:45:43	@FabledDemon Talia stared at the wall, her expression blank.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 00:46:50	"Father has the intention to terminate the Dark Knight..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 00:47:18	@FabledDemon "Of course not!" She snapped.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 00:50:57	@FabledDemon "....he is with the Knight, father..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 00:51:52	@ChocolateSupes Talia huffed. "Stupid man." Without any warning, Talia struck his jaw with her fist.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 00:54:13	@ChocolateSupes Her expression turned to confusion. "The hell...?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 01:00:19	@ChocolateSupes "How 'bout you walk away right now?" She squinted at him.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 01:07:47	@ChocolateSupes "Or not."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 01:08:13	@FabledDemon "Alright...what ever will make you happy.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 01:09:20	@FabledDemon "You are welcome, father."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-09 02:11:16	Stares at TL.

"What the hell...?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:20:06	@VexingDetective "Not that it's any of your business but yes, we have been."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:23:54	@VexingDetective Talia crossed her arms, scoffing. "It is /none/ of your business. Bruce can handle his own problems /alone/."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:24:33	Define Talia
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:25:25	"Sounds about right."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:28:38	"How rude. 
No manners."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:29:55	@VexingDetective "It is what I do best." She gave a casual shrug as if it didn't really matter to her.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:30:40	"/My kind/?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:31:48	@VexingDetective "The feeling mutual."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:32:04	@VexingDetective **feeling is
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:33:20	"Ow. That hurt. That hit me right in my heart." She rested her hand on her chest, clearly being sarcastic.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:34:50	@VexingDetective "No. This time it is important. I do not have /time/ to deal with what is called love. My main focus is Damian."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:36:58	@VexingDetective "This again? What?" She held her hands up. "I am not trying to take him....again."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:38:49	@VexingDetective "Yes, really."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:41:06	@VexingDetective "Fine. Don't believe me. I do not need you to."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:44:17	@VexingDetective "Oh, I doubt you could actually stop me but...there is nothing to stop me /from/."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:45:06	"This hate radiating.
Oh, how I /love/ it."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:45:22	@VexingDetective "Pure luck."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:55:36	@VexingDetective  --from this questioning.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:57:36	"Do not speak of me that way! I am not some item for your eyes! A thought to linger in your minds! Disgusting, revolting men!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:00:18	"Creepy bastard."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:01:39	@TheLegendaryBat "No..nothing. I'm fine."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:02:58	@TheLegendaryBat "I am fine, Bruce!" She barked.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:12:30	@TheLegendaryBat "I don't /need/ your help! I don't /want/ your help." Her tone was like ice.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 00:48:39	"What is the matter with you people?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 00:49:53	@VexingDetective "Actually...yes."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 00:52:38	@VexingDetective She could hear the tinge of sarcasm in his voice. "I do not need your assistance." Her eyes narrowing slightly.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 00:55:57	"I am not always up to trouble.

Psshh."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:03:52	@VexingDetective "None that concern you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:26:21	@SolidKryptonian @urbandictionary "Walk away..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:27:40	@VexingDetective "Why are you so concerned? Afraid I might do something?" She laughed dryly.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:38:08	"...hello, small child?" She furrowed her brow.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:46:24	@VexingDetective "Whatever you say."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:51:59	@VexingDetective She was unphased, staring at him looking a bit bored. "Are you finished interrogating me?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:53:32	"@SteelKon_: Dami's mom has got it going...actually no. That's a bad idea"

"Very bad."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 01:55:20	@VexingDetective "......" She continued staring in silence, hoping he would become annoyed or creeped out. Whichever would dismiss her--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:07:25	"Do not test me." http://t.co/7KBBobdQMt
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:10:10	@TheLegendaryBat "Don't."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:20:06	@TheLegendaryBat "I don't have to learn to deal with it!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:20:36	@SpeedingGold Talia stared blankly at the person, her arms crossed.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:56:07	"....there are children present at the time, miss Jane."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 03:02:31	"I do not have the time nor the inclination to argue with you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:13:11	"It seems I've missed all the fun."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:14:12	@SpeedingGold "....do you wish to be hurt?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:18:50	"Do not allow my beauty to fool you." http://t.co/mc6s77zPl9
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:21:58	"Mr. Arrow, I advise you silence yourself."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:11:14	"Do people wish to upset me? Is that the plan? 

Immature imbeciles."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:18:07	"They all expect me to terminate one of them.

Ha~"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:24:18	Shifty eyes.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:26:28	"....listen, bird boy, how about you shut your mouth, yes? Yes."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:30:04	@ChocolateSupes "Oh? When did this happen?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:33:15	@ChocolateSupes "I do not remember /running away/."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:33:53	"Is it Piss Talia Off Day?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:35:06	@ChocolateSupes "I did not run away. You must have me confused, Kryptonian."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:36:40	@ChocolateSupes "Hmm. Must not be important because I do not remember it, Alien."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:38:07	"How do you tolerate so much irrelevance?  I would have have went on a little killing spree already~"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:40:03	@ChocolateSupes "You are the one coming to me, questioning /my/ leadership skills."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:41:51	@ChocolateSupes "You want to be my friend....yet you stand before me, dishing out insults!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:42:34	Keeps repeating the words 'Stay calm'.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:43:23	@ChocolateSupes "I do not need you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:44:50	@ChocolateSupes "I wish of your disposal."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:54:55	@ChocolateSupes "...out of where?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:58:12	@ChocolateSupes "How about you /leave/."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 21:03:16	"Not bad. Not evil. Merely misunderstood.
Pssh~" http://t.co/sqKTslQNdw
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 21:06:25	"Mask is a softy?" She stifled a laugh.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 21:07:57	Talia rolled her eyes.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 21:08:50	"Just...ignore him...just ignore...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 21:10:41	"Yes...
...my name is Talia. And who are you?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 21:13:43	Talia gave the small boy the sweetest smile she could conjure. "It is very nice to meet you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 21:18:05	Talia rose a brow. "You are a very curious boy, aren't you?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 21:28:44	@abuseinacoat Once she saw the frown she gave a faint laugh. "It is not a bad thing."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 21:29:56	"It is very sad that a small child has been more decent towards me then all the adults combined.
Hnn...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 21:31:38	"A person /tries/ to be nice but is judged right out of the gate.

I see."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 21:33:11	"I've kept my word about not hurting anyone."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 21:33:56	Resists urge to bitch at Arrow.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 21:36:11	"You can not ban people from speaking to me!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 21:38:19	@abuseinacoat She wanted to burst into laughter but kept a straight face, nodding once. "Thank you, Colin."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 21:53:27	"Father deserved that..." She shrugged casually. http://t.co/gtfB14nd3r
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:23:49	"No, no. /You/ suck."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:25:20	"Did he really use the word old?

Arrow....."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:26:19	"How about no."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:27:51	@SpeedingGold She swooshes her hand at him. "Be gone, annoying boy."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:29:21	"....I think all of us know that you are /much/ older than me."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:29:56	"My name is not stupid."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:30:52	She can't help but burst into a fit of laughter.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:36:09	"Annoying little boy...
....lucky I am in a decent mood."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:38:36	"Are you sucking up to me, Mask?" She flashed a smile. "I don't like suck ups."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:41:07	"I was not talking to /you/!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:41:40	"Smart man."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:43:22	"No, actually I wasn't and do not speak of The Knight like that."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:45:44	"I do not care. This conversation with you is pointless." Talia rolls her eyes in annoyance.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:48:57	"Oh, is that a threat I hear?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:53:12	"I am a murderer, a killer...an assassin. 

I am not ashamed of what I /am/." http://t.co/4FSZNg7rMK
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:55:35	@FabledArrow "You are two seconds away from meeting your end."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:57:11	@FabledArrow Her fists clenched, clearly angered by his presence. "Your life."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:58:48	"See? The Knight's daughter is wiser than Arrow despite her young age."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 16:59:23	@FabledArrow "Creature, please leave. I asked nicely."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 22:01:43	@abuseinacoat "Um..yes..but it seems that he is in Star City with his sister." She shook her head. "I must stay in Gotham until his return."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 22:08:25	@abuseinacoat Out of instinct, Talia became very suspicious. "Why do you want to know?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 22:14:33	@abuseinacoat She relaxed slightly, noticing his sheepishness. "I will only be here for a short time..I am staying in a hotel."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 22:20:33	@abuseinacoat "Ahh..I am afraid me and Mr. Wayne do not get along."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 22:28:34	"I am a wolf-?

I do not understand this logic...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 22:30:05	@abuseinacoat "At the moment, no we do not." She huffed. "I am what you consider..." She paused. "Not a good person."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 22:34:14	"Seductress?

Okay, yes, I admit to that." Talia snickers.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 22:34:40	@abuseinacoat "I am not good." She laughed flatly.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 22:45:31	@abuseinacoat She crouched down to his height. "Do you wanna know what I do for a living?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 22:48:35	@abuseinacoat "I am an assassin." Her tone was stale as she stood back up. "It is in my nature. I will /always/ be considered evil."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 22:54:32	@abuseinacoat "I have been this way since I was very young, there is no turning back for me." Talia shook her head as she rested her hand--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:25:37	@SpeedingGold "Actually.." A smirk traced her lips. "No."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:26:13	@TheLegendaryBat "Stop bothering me, Bruce. I am not your responsibility."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:27:21	@SpeedingGold "Kid flash? What a /stupid/ name."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:30:06	@TheLegendaryBat "I am dropping this conversation!" Talia growled, clenching her fists.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:33:20	@TheLegendaryBat She threw her arms up in frustration and anger. "I have done nothing wrong!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:33:46	@SpeedingGold "Afraid not."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:36:14	@TheLegendaryBat "Can I not be trusted? Is it impossible for me to actually want to do what is for the common good? Can people not change?--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:37:00	@TheLegendaryBat -- Honestly, I am not surprised that you have no faith in me."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:37:24	@SpeedingGold "You go do that."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:38:24	@SpeedingGold Her lips drew into a straight line. "Why?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:41:35	@TheLegendaryBat "I don't care." She turned. "I can take care of myself." With that, she disappeared into the night without another word.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 02:42:24	@SpeedingGold "Touch me and my blade shall meet your neck."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 15:31:47	"What have I come on to~?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 15:35:01	"I see.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 15:39:57	Talia pinched the bridge of her nose in frustration. "Why does he have little faith in me? Just because I am a woman does not mean I can't--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 15:40:21	@FearsomeThreat --lead the league."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 15:46:14	"I have a way with words." http://t.co/sYJWOr47Z8
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:01:30	@FabledArrow "Says the one who always wants to start something with one of the most dangerous women on this planet."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:03:14	@FabledArrow She rose her hand up to his face. "Conversation..." She closed her hand into a fist, cutting him off in mid sentence. "..over."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:05:54	"I can not hurt him.

I made a promise not to hurt anyone...yet."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:07:52	"He is testing my patience which I have little of."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:09:18	@FabledArrow "Listen, /old man/, I am saving you. Annoy me any further and I shall stab you with your own arrow."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:12:00	@FabledArrow Talia's eyes narrowed, her tone cold. "Leave."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:13:34	@FabledArrow "I said leave!" She barked.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:15:36	@FabledArrow "You are an idiot." Her arms crossed, standing her ground.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:18:09	@FabledArrow "Are you done?" Talia just stared at him, displaying a very unamused expression.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:19:27	@FabledArrow "You are very lucky I keep my promises."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:22:07	@FabledArrow "...." She continued staring at him hoping he would eventually become annoyed or creeped out.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:24:52	@FabledArrow Her stare soon became a glare as she realized he wasn't going to leave. "Why just stand there?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:26:09	@FabledArrow "I have no place to be. I can do this all day."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:26:55	"I have become rather sick of the nicknames."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:27:41	@FabledArrow "Oh? And if something were to happen to Speedy?" A devious smile spread across her lips.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:35:00	@FabledArrow "/I/ won't...but other's...well, I can not speak on their behalf."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:35:53	@FabledArrow "Yeah, okay." Talia scoffed.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:37:10	@FabledArrow "Willing to risk the life of your little sidekick to pester me, Arrow?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:40:36	@FabledArrow "Green Arrow junior? Your son?" She stifled a laugh. "/My/ associates could easily outnumber them...they are not as skilled--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:41:02	@FabledArrow --and as experienced as you, yes?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:44:49	@FabledArrow "I see." She stopped from going any further, that same smile on her face.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:46:13	@FabledArrow "Oh? Enlighten me then."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 17:48:16	@FabledArrow For some reason that had struck a nerve. "You know nothing of what I /know/!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 22:55:19	@abuseinacoat --on his shoulder. "They /expect/ me to hurt you too."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:06:11	"I dislike hotels.
In the halls, there is Christmas music.
In the rooms, there are Christmas decorations.
On the TVs, there are only--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:06:35	@FearsomeThreat --Christmas programs." She shook her head.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:07:15	@abuseinacoat Talia huffed. "I'm not going to hurt you, the so called /heroes/ expect me to though..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:13:18	@abuseinacoat "Very true..." She looked to the side momentarily. "It is late, you should get home."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:14:38	"....am I not good enough, Father!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:16:50	@abuseinacoat "No, it is fine...he must make his own choices."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:20:52	"I will have to /do/?" Talia's eyes brimmed with anger. "I am just a little piece in this game, aren't I!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:25:00	@FabledDemon "You already know how Damian feels about the league...and his father will not allow him to return....am I not good enough to--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:25:22	@FabledDemon --take over?" Her fist clenched.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:28:47	@FabledDemon Talia stayed silent for a period of time. "I can not do that, Father.." The words were faint.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:31:30	@FabledDemon "I made a promise. I will not break my word." Her arms crossed, knowing she was going to get herself into trouble. "I will--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:31:50	@FabledDemon --not follow your orders..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:34:38	@FabledDemon Talia stood her ground. "None of your concern, Father.." She rose her chin arrogantly. "I am a grown woman...I will do what I--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:34:56	@FabledDemon --please."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:38:44	@FabledDemon "Father..." She spoke breathlessly as she took a step back, her eyes trained on the sword.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:41:40	@FabledDemon "I am your daughter!" Her voice rose as she was backed into a corner.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:43:48	@FabledDemon "I am your blood yet, you threaten my life because I will not talk!?" Talia drew her own blade, afraid he might take action.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:46:18	@FabledDemon "I have done so much for the league, for you!" Her eyes narrowed.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:48:09	@FabledDemon Talia stood confidently. "I refuse."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:51:10	@FabledDemon "No! Of course not!" Her breath was rapid. "Father...please. I only want what is best for Damian...and The Knight is what is--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:52:06	@FabledDemon --best for him. He is only a child, he is not ready to rule." Her eyes shut tightly, ready to meet her death.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:55:17	@FabledDemon Talia rested her hand against her throat, glaring at her father silently.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 23:58:03	@FabledDemon "....no." Her eyes dropped to the ground.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:00:59	@FabledDemon She shrugged his hand off her shoulder. "He will not be your successor..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:01:48	"Hurt him and I slice you up like sushi."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:04:06	@FabledDemon Talia's temper got the best of her as she lashed out. "No! It is not about me, Father!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:04:34	@RedHelmetRobin "No." Her tone was flat.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:06:48	@FabledDemon "Do it! Kill me! I do not care! I will not follow your orders!" She ignored his words.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:09:35	@FabledDemon "E-Excommunicating me!? No! You can't do that!" Her eyes looking up at him frantically.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:11:20	@FabledDemon "Father, do not do this!" Talia pleaded.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:13:03	@FabledDemon "I am your /daughter/..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:13:48	"I can not believe this~"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 18:03:04	"I am concerned..father is upset with me for some odd reason..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 18:03:34	"I have done nothing wrong."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 18:11:24	@FabledArrow "....I am done speaking to you." Talia turned on her heels, walking away.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 18:18:32	"Must. Keep. Promise."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 18:22:00	"I can keep it!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 17:05:43	"85% of you people belong in Arkahm."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 17:11:55	Talia cocked a brow. "And I thought /I/ was messed up."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 17:14:42	Does not know if that was directed at her...just stays quiet.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 17:16:24	"I think your crazy enough for the both of us, Harrison..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 17:16:40	//**you're
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:15:25	@FabledDemon Her eyes brimmed with tears. "Don't..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:18:00	@FabledDemon She held the tears back, her expression hardening. "Why do enjoy seeing me suffer?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:20:25	@FabledDemon She pushed away from him. "We do not share the same goal now, Father...I refuse to help you..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:23:15	@FabledDemon Her grip tightened around the blade that was still in her hand. "Why must you do this? I am not the enemy.....Ra's...." She--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:23:33	@FabledDemon --spoke her father's name slowly.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:27:19	"You do /not/ excommunicate /me/!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:28:51	@FabledDemon Her eyes had a fire in them that seemed to be fueled by anger. "Do not do this...I will be forced to take you out..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:31:54	@FabledDemon She became unsure of herself but still stood as if she didn't doubt herself. "....make your move...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:34:24	@FabledDemon She growled lowly as her blade lowered. "I will return...this league shall perish without me..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:36:51	@FabledDemon Talia huffed. "....you shall meet your end soon...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:48:26	"......if this is my fate so be it."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:51:44	@FabledDemon "That was not a threat, Father...that was my promise to you. Even if I die myself..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:53:54	@FabledDemon She twitched slightly as she slowly stepped away.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 00:56:23	@FabledDemon "My sister is no better than me!" She spat. "You /know/ I am the best!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 18:41:46	"Many refer to me as The Demon's Daughter.

You may call me Talia.." http://t.co/2aqsESTwBn
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 18:56:40	"I am a natural born leader."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-10 19:04:42	"Shut up."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 18:03:03	"And I see there is a new Miley Cyrus on the TL.

Hnn..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 18:35:05	"Almost was killed by my own father.

Check that off of my bucket list." Obvious sarcasm on her voice.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 18:37:09	"Unlike you, Harrison, I am not a cannibal and would /never/ kill my own blood.

Sick bastard."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 18:41:46	"Yes, Noelle, they are."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 18:43:25	"But it is something that you must adapt to quickly because....there are many."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 18:47:38	"Sword to my throat and you expect me to still trust you?

Yeah. Like that will happen."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:02:07	@FabledDemon She held her blade up, debating on attacking him but dropped it to the ground. "We /were/ blood...now we are enemies...I hope--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:02:31	@FabledDemon --you realize what you have done."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:05:59	@FabledDemon "Because I do not want /my/ son exposed to the league any longer!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:07:53	@FabledDemon "I see now that if he becomes the leader of the league...he will turn out like you...I can not allow that."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:11:38	@FabledDemon "No!" She shook her head.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:13:31	@FabledDemon "....but you still wish for him to become the leader of the league?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:16:17	@FabledDemon Her hands folded behind her back. "My beloved does not approve of the league.
Damian does not wish to be the league's leader.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:19:04	@FabledDemon "Understood..." Talia paused for a slight moment. "...but if you try anything, Father, I will rip your heart from your chest."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:21:41	@FabledDemon She didn't trust him but to keep his suspicion down she gave her father a hug.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:24:14	@FabledDemon She quickly pulled away from the hug.  "Take you to them both? No..I know you father..you will try to kill.." Her words--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:24:27	@FabledDemon --trailed off.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:26:23	@FabledDemon "I do not trust you..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:28:16	@FabledDemon "I do not even know where they are!" She exclaimed.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:30:54	@FabledDemon "They don't trust me..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:31:59	@FabledDemon "...they will not..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:34:08	@FabledDemon "And how do you suggest I get them to trust me? I have given up.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:35:43	@FabledDemon "Turn into a softy?" She laughed. "Not happening."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:36:52	@FabledDemon She stayed silent, thinking.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:39:22	@FabledDemon "I don't know...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:42:01	@FabledDemon "I have no way to get into contact with Damian..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:44:29	@FabledDemon She huffed. "I'll see what I can do...but Father....that promise I made earlier..." Talia's jaw tensed. "I always stay true--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:44:47	@FabledDemon --to my word."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:46:42	@FabledDemon "Do not thank me." And with that, Talia simply walked out of the room eventually exiting the building.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:51:26	@FabledDemon She stopped, realizing he was following. "Father...let me go at this alone...you will see your grandson soon enough and he--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:51:46	@FabledDemon --shall tell you what I already have..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:16:18	Talia is currently....
.....plotting someone's death.
So~
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:17:55	"How do you defeat someone who knows your every move? Your every kick, punch, slash....how?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:20:14	"Usually, I am the person to hire for this...erm...work, Noelle."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:22:35	"Cheat?" A tinge of curiosity edging her voice.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:24:55	"....I do not know....

You don't know who I speak of...he will expect /everything/."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:27:11	"I have no allies at the moment."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:28:45	"Say what?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:31:50	"Helena..." Talia gave a look of concern, a rare expression that would be found on her face. "You carry the child of The Arrow, if--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:32:31	@FearsomeThreat --something were to happen to you, Arrow would send the entire Justice League after me.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:36:23	"I will wait until the right time to strike. I must prep... 
...this battle will happen in the new year...mustn't be to hasty, I guess."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:36:53	"Noelle? What is the matter?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:38:23	"Hm...okay. If you say so." She replied not convinced.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:46:27	"I have several looks.." http://t.co/npsUeaKObm
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:53:06	@TheLegendaryBat "Whatever, Bruce, I say what I want."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:55:58	@TheLegendaryBat She scoffs. "Mhmm.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 19:58:06	@TheLegendaryBat "Exactly. I make my /own/ choices."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:01:23	@TheLegendaryBat Her eyes widened. "What?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:03:34	@TheLegendaryBat "....." Talia was silent for a time. "Bruce...my father wishes to talk to you and Damian..." She shook her head. "I have--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:04:10	@TheLegendaryBat --suspicions he may try and terminate...you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:09:16	@TheLegendaryBat "I do not believe he would ever harm Damian...he is the only one that Ra's sees as a successor, Bruce."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:12:16	@TheLegendaryBat "...he wants to hear the words from Damian...that he does not want to be apart of the league..otherwise he doesn't believe-
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:13:06	@TheLegendaryBat --me! I just...I do not trust him! What if Damian declines? What then? Ra's will surely try and kill him! Then I...--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:13:26	@TheLegendaryBat --will be forced to take action."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:18:11	@TheLegendaryBat She nodded once, shutting her emotions down. "I will hold you to your word."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 01:54:13	@FabledDemon "Alright." She nodded once. "Farewell."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:00:48	Talia's fingers raked through her hair. "Damn near impossible."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:05:14	"There are innocents present!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:09:38	"Stupid is such an elementary term, Harrison."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:12:12	"What do you hold against gingers!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:13:46	"...I see."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:14:13	@MistahJ_AC "...I see that."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:16:35	@MistahJ_AC Talia's arms crossed. "Is that so?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:17:51	"He eats people?" Her brow furrowed.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:18:38	@MistahJ_AC "I do not consider us /friends/."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:20:20	"Well, aren't you a piece of work? "
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:21:11	@MistahJ_AC "I have friends but I do not desire to have your friendship, Joker..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:22:09	"We knew that, Croc." She gave an eye roll of annoyance.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:24:50	@MistahJ_AC "I doubt you do..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:25:22	"You do not know me?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:26:50	@MistahJ_AC Talia just stared at him in silence.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:28:15	".....I do not like your tone with me. I shall cut your tongue out of your mouth if you speak to me in that manner again."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:29:39	@MistahJ_AC She backed up, grabbing her own blade. "I advise you not to try."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:30:45	".........I shall be back.
I have weapons to sharpen.
We will be having Croc stew for dinner."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:32:47	@MistahJ_AC "No...because we are on the same /side/."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:35:20	@MistahJ_AC She rose her blade, pointing it straight at him. "If not, this cold steel would be plunged into your eyeball already."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:37:14	"...The Clown Prince underestimates me?
Typical."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:38:16	@MistahJ_AC She lowered her sword. "You are a psychopath. Eh..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:40:18	@MistahJ_AC "I shall take my leave..." She turned on her heels, walking away.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:23:43	@TheLegendaryBat "It was only for the peotection of my son.." She muttered.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:25:29	@TheLegendaryBat //**protection
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:26:49	@TheLegendaryBat She turned, preparing to walk away but stopped. "...thank you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:32:40	@TheLegendaryBat She sighed softly. "What ever you say, Bruce."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:34:01	"Some people's idiocy is...just...wow."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:35:29	@TheLegendaryBat "I am still your enemy..." Her fists clenched. "Do not forget that."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:39:31	@TheLegendaryBat "Hmm...you are being rather foolish. Caring about /me/? A woman who has no mercy? Do you not see me as a threat?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:43:50	@TheLegendaryBat ".....no." Her eyes wandered away from his, standing in silence as she then walked away.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:47:39	"He thinks we are similar?

No."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:48:17	@TheLegendaryBat Talia ignored him completely and walked off.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:52:37	@TheLegendaryBat She huffed in dismay, turning back to face him, clearly annoyed. "What is it now?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:56:14	@TheLegendaryBat "I'd say we are done talking." Her arms folded over her chest.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 20:59:40	@TheLegendaryBat "This is a trick, isn't it?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 21:03:36	@TheLegendaryBat "Then what do you want!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 21:06:42	@TheLegendaryBat She eyed him. "No..?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 21:09:38	@TheLegendaryBat "And how would /you/ know what makes him happy?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 21:13:52	@TheLegendaryBat "Fine...we will try and patch things up..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:43:19	[Must. Find. The. Bat.]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:44:02	@MistahJ_AC She turned slowly. "What?" She eyed the gun. "Hmph, nice."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:47:56	@MistahJ_AC "And why is it pointed at me, clown?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:50:03	@MistahJ_AC "Oh, come on. Why waste bullets on me?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:52:39	@MistahJ_AC "Your jokes never get old..." She said rather sarcastically.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:53:44	"Very close.

/Very/ close to snapping on the clown."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:54:39	@MistahJ_AC Her right hand rested on her hip. "We are not /banging/."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:57:10	@MistahJ_AC "Does pissing people off come naturally or do you have to work on it?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 02:58:55	@MistahJ_AC Talia's jaw tensed. "Silence."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 03:01:09	@MistahJ_AC "Of course he wasn't."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 03:05:04	@MistahJ_AC Her eyes darkened. "Leave my presence."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 03:06:38	@MistahJ_AC She crossed her arms, studying him.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 23:45:34	"@TheMrRevelation: "So many red heads following me....am I a ginger magnet?""

"Ginger hater!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 23:47:04	@TheMrRevelation "Good."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:00:34	@TheLegendaryBat Talia sighed, giving up. Knowing she would not win this argument. "Fine."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:04:44	@TheLegendaryBat "Issues? What issues?" She said rather dumbly.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:05:45	".....someone please shut him up."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:09:37	@TheLegendaryBat "I have no issues with you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:10:04	"Keep singing. I dare you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:11:03	"Good boy."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:12:47	@TheLegendaryBat "Now your /issues/ with me."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:15:19	@TheLegendaryBat "...that is who I am."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:18:19	@TheLegendaryBat "I can be any way I wish!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:20:48	@TheLegendaryBat "I am happy. Do not try and change me!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:25:45	@MisterForgotten "What was that?" A brow rose, her arms crossed over her chest as she approached the young man who seemed to have--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:26:00	@MisterForgotten --a rather smart mouth.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:26:42	@ChocolateSupes "But they sound the same, yes?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:29:44	@MisterForgotten She stared at him for a long period of time in silence before speaking. "...do you know who I am!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:31:38	@MisterForgotten She took in a deep breath. "No. I am Talia Al Ghul daughter of Ra's Al Ghul."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:32:11	@TheLegendaryBat "...I am happy."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:33:48	@MisterForgotten Talia furrowed her brow. "Ra's Al Ghul, leader of the League of Assassins!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:36:01	@TheLegendaryBat She sighed. "I am fine, Bruce."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:36:27	@MisterForgotten "Then you are an irrelevant idiot!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:38:38	@MisterForgotten "I do not have time for this!" She gestured toward him then stomped off.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 01:41:04	"Idiots! Idiots everywhere!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:10:14	"Should have just stabbed the clown in the face.

Then he wouldn't be laughing."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:14:28	@RedHelmetRobin "Jason...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:16:22	@RedHelmetRobin "Just..." She rubbed her temples. "Silence yourself."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:17:34	@RedHelmetRobin "I will plunge my blade into your rib cage if you do not stop speaking."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:20:12	@RedHelmetRobin "I beg to differ."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:22:31	@RedHelmetRobin "You should not enjoy it. You will find yourself dead......again.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:24:45	@RedHelmetRobin "Look who is on edge now." Her tone clearly sarcastic.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:27:13	@RedHelmetRobin ".........." She glared at him in silence.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:32:36	@RedHelmetRobin "Blah, blah, blah is all I hear coming from you, Jason."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:36:39	"It takes /two/ to exchange a kiss, Jason. Stupid man." http://t.co/Tn4xwjg8XG
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 04:48:08	@SonOfBman Talia huffed in annoyance as she approached the door. Who would be bothering her at such an hour? She opened the door and her--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 04:48:45	@SonOfBman --expression went blank as her eyes focused on the boy. "Damian?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 04:55:04	@SonOfBman The hug caught her off guard but she soon returned it, kissing the top of his head. "Then you shall return home.." Her voice--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 04:55:37	@SonOfBman --was a faint whisper. "What is wrong, Damian..?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 04:57:01	"I am guessing I will blamed for this too. Yes?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:02:29	@SonOfBman Talia nodded, not wanting to upset him any further with her words. She released him from the hug. "Grab your bag,--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:03:56	@SonOfBman --my darling son." She turned walking back into the room. "...I will speak to your father...not now but in the morning.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:05:20	"Where is The Knight!?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:09:59	@SonOfBman She turned facing him. "Of course, Damian." Talia was furious at the fact that her son was feeling /any/ of this. She had--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:11:07	@SonOfBman --thought he was happier with Bruce but obviously she had thought wrong.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:15:37	@SonOfBman "What has changed your mind...?" Talia heard the shakiness in his voice, her hands folding behind her back.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:16:26	@GothamPD559 Talia just stared at the man, unamused. "Are you done, sir?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:26:47	@SonOfBman "Bruce has been ignoring you!?" Her tone raised.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:30:18	@SonOfBman "...shell of a man." She muttered under her breath not intended for  him to hear. Her attention turns back to him. "You will--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:30:42	@SonOfBman --return to the league with me, understood?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:34:08	@SonOfBman "But...I will have to speak to your father about this..if I just..leave with you, he will surely follow along with the others."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:39:34	@SonOfBman "Do not worry, you /will/ return...I am merely letting him know. You don't have to come with me if you do not wish to.--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:40:22	@SonOfBman --I imagine an argument will take place and I rather not have you present when that happens."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:44:28	@SonOfBman "Of course you can, my little warrior." A smiled traced her lips realizing that Bruce nor anyone could stop this.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:51:49	@SonOfBman "Now..get some rest..." Talia herself would not be getting any herself. "...you have a big day ahead of you tomorrow, your--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-12 05:52:18	@SonOfBman --grandfather will be most pleased to see you.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:37:15	@RedHelmetRobin "I have an urge to rip your tongue out...."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:39:32	@RedHelmetRobin "....I will."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:43:43	@RedHelmetRobin "You truly are a stupid man, aren't you?" She ran her fingers down his arm before twisting it behind his back with--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:44:03	@RedHelmetRobin --incredible speed. "Hmm?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:44:47	"I felt like it. Heat of the moment."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:46:51	@RedHelmetRobin She gave a weak laugh, her hands wrapping around his wrist. "Now be a good boy and let go..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:47:45	"Very sure."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:54:37	@RedHelmetRobin Her hands tightened around his wrist. "Spar with you?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:55:56	@RedHelmetRobin Her eyes scanned his expression. "Do you want to fight me, Jason?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:57:47	@RedHelmetRobin "I could change that..." She tried prying his fingers from her throat.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 04:59:36	@RedHelmetRobin Talia took a few steps back, pulling a blade out. She examined it, not even paying attention to him. "Are you sure--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:00:22	@RedHelmetRobin  --you want to do this?" She ran her finger across the smooth steel.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:03:19	@RedHelmetRobin She rose the blade so it pointed straight at him. "What good is a bet if one of us are dead, Mr. Todd?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:06:45	@RedHelmetRobin "Hmm...or no. What is your bet?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:09:28	@RedHelmetRobin "Or not..." Her blade lowered.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:11:14	@RedHelmetRobin "You are not worth fighting with."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:14:27	@RedHelmetRobin "Whoops? Just did."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:16:31	@RedHelmetRobin "Sure you were."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:41:04	@RedHelmetRobin "I shall take my leave." She turned on her heels, walking off.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:42:29	@RedHelmetRobin Her walking ceased. "What?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:44:06	@RedHelmetRobin "Hmm. Farewell, Jason."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:45:52	"Stab......."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:49:38	@RedHelmetRobin She stared at him. "Obsessed?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:50:50	@RedHelmetRobin "I'll take that as a yes."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:51:59	@RedHelmetRobin She swooshes her hand at him. "Be gone."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:52:50	@RedHelmetRobin "I like no one."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:53:57	@RedHelmetRobin "....I don't know."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:55:32	@RedHelmetRobin "Leave my presence, Todd, you annoy me."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:57:10	@RedHelmetRobin "Do you understand English!? I said leave."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 05:59:14	@RedHelmetRobin She shrugged. "And I care why?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 06:01:02	@RedHelmetRobin She huffed, realizing he wasn't leaving.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-11 06:03:26	"Finally! Thank the gods!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-13 00:09:57	@FabledDemon She huffed. "I suppose I was."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-13 03:24:55	@FabledDemon "...you said you would not hurt the detective."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-13 02:45:50	@FabledDemon Talia's jaw tensed. "You do not need to rub it in, Father."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-13 02:56:10	@FabledDemon She scoffed, her arms crossing.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-13 03:10:58	"Let's see how well you do talking without a tongue." Talia's eyes squinted, growling lowly.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 04:40:22	@SonOfBman Talia was a bit startled by his presence. "Hello, darling."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 21:30:54	@SonOfBman --have sent for transportation to come and pick you up. I don't want you present when me and your father are discussing this--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 21:31:13	@SonOfBman --matter."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 21:33:13	@SonOfBman "In a few hours, my sweet." Talia answered in monotone.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 21:38:16	@SonOfBman "Do you have everything you need?" Talia rose a brow as she began toward the door. "I may not be back in time to see you off."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 21:42:17	@SonOfBman "Then I shall see you soon..." She opened the door and took one last look back at him. "Your grandfather will be most pleased--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 21:42:29	@SonOfBman --to see you.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 21:43:24	[Now..] Talia thought. [...to get his attention.]
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 22:54:03	@TheLegendaryBat Talia was just leaving the hotel in search of Bruce actually, walking down the sidewalk, away from the building.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 22:57:46	@TheLegendaryBat Talia noticed the vehicle and smirked to herself, mumbling. "Right on schedule.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 23:01:29	@TheLegendaryBat Talia's hands rested on her hips as she called out. "Oh, beloved."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 23:05:30	@TheLegendaryBat Talia expressed a look of innocence. "Who do you speak of, Detective?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 23:09:44	@TheLegendaryBat "Are you saying you have not been paying attention to our son's where abouts?" She stated in fake anger.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 23:15:18	@TheLegendaryBat "...he's returned to the league.." She rose her chin arrogantly. "He has made his choice."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 23:19:04	@TheLegendaryBat "He wishes to be with the league.." Her voice softened.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 23:21:42	@TheLegendaryBat "You will do no such thing!" Talia said with authority.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 23:23:53	@TheLegendaryBat Talia grabbed his wrist. "No! You're not going anywhere!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 23:27:38	@TheLegendaryBat "Let him be happy!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 23:30:16	@TheLegendaryBat Talia followed after him. "You are being foolish!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 23:33:56	@TheLegendaryBat Talia took in a deep breath. "Do not do this.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 23:40:08	@TheLegendaryBat Talia looked down at him for a while. "Why must you always disrupt someone's happiness? He is not happy here! Let him--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 23:40:29	@TheLegendaryBat --go to the place he feels accepted."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 23:43:26	@TheLegendaryBat She huffed taking a step away. "Fine...
...you must know the league will not let you see Damian willingly."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 23:47:54	@TheLegendaryBat "That you shall..." She muttered as she began walking again.
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 17:11:28	@MistahJ_AC "...no. Deciding whether or not I should stab you or not."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2014-12-14 21:29:48	@SonOfBman Talia hands folded behind her back, locking her fingers together. "I have not had a chance to speak to your father yet but...I--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 22:41:15	"Kiss a ginger day?

I will pass on this /stupid/ day.

Hnn..."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 22:42:39	@FabledArrow "Oh, I bet he is."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 22:47:17	@FabledFate "Do not speak of my father in a rude manner.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 22:49:30	@FabledFate "I will end you.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 22:51:38	"Nabu is pushing his luck."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 22:54:55	@FabledFate "I have /friends/ who can.."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 23:00:39	@FabledArrow "Gross? Not in the slightest."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 23:10:13	"Do not underestimate me.

Possibly." http://t.co/iEaQgDSIBI
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 04:46:38	"And I  have returned. Was I missed, my dears?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 04:49:13	@AcrobatGrayson "Eck...hello, bird boy."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 04:50:23	@TeenTitan__HQ @TheLegendaryBat @SonOfBman "Do you feel the need to have your mother board ripped out? Hmm?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 04:50:48	@AcrobatGrayson "Exactly what it sounds like."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 04:54:30	@AcrobatGrayson "It is never a pleasure to see you."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 04:55:18	@BrutalProtector "My ass is /still/ better."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 04:59:04	@AcrobatGrayson "I advise you to silence yourself."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 04:59:41	"Idiotic imbeciles."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-12 05:02:13	@AcrobatGrayson "Shut up, boy!"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-13 02:48:05	@TheLegendaryBat "And what am I doing to you, Bruce?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-13 02:55:33	@TheLegendaryBat "No one can truly let me go, my beloved."
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-13 03:05:44	@TheLegendaryBat Talia took a step closer, looking up at him. "Did?"
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-13 03:11:08	@TheLegendaryBat "You are the hero of Gotham. The Knight. Of course you deserve it." Talia's eyes narrowing. "Do not let others tell you--
2884028804	FearsomeThreat	2015-01-13 03:11:22	@TheLegendaryBat --any different."
