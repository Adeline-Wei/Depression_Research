288449373	sinemertansel	2015-05-04 21:13:38	I don't understand why I can't go to the Met Gala instead of spending my evening learning about q-ary repetition codes and fields
288449373	sinemertansel	2015-05-04 21:17:09	I really fancy a hot chocolate @elliepengilly but the penthouse is located too far away. Can we ask Nic to make some and bring it to us...

288449373	sinemertansel	2015-05-07 10:43:46	@MissGullible whereabouts in the library are you?
288449373	sinemertansel	2015-05-07 10:44:49	Someone's come to look for their earphones that they left at a comp earlier. It's obviously been taken. Awk #liblife
288449373	sinemertansel	2015-05-07 11:14:36	So upsetting to see that this poor girl's go ahead bar is stuck in the vending machine and she's just shaking it as much as she can #liblife
288449373	sinemertansel	2015-05-07 11:15:01	It's cool though, she got the big strong security guy to get it out

288449373	sinemertansel	2015-05-23 20:13:28	THAT SPIN #Eurovision2015 Feel like Belgium should win just for that

288449373	sinemertansel	2015-05-23 22:11:04	@NotSeriousEd that is a fair point.. I just like guessing them all
288449373	sinemertansel	2015-05-23 22:14:17	@NotSeriousEd maybe Russia but if I had to pick from the current top 3 I would hope it would be Sweden. That man is beautiful. You?
288449373	sinemertansel	2015-05-23 22:21:31	@NotSeriousEd yeah definitely! Haha, it was Latvia for me! Upsetting that Israel doesn't have more points, such a good performance
288449373	sinemertansel	2015-05-23 22:22:48	Might move to Sweden
288449373	sinemertansel	2015-05-23 22:23:37	@NotSeriousEd I know!! It's ridiculous. Germany deserve to be in the top five. Do not understand why Italy is so high

288449373	sinemertansel	2015-06-02 20:56:09	Why would you make your tinder picture one of you kissing a bottle of grey goose? Do you want the world to know you're a dick right away?
288449373	sinemertansel	2015-06-02 16:31:02	I need a manicure and a cuddle
288449373	sinemertansel	2015-06-06 14:13:08	Counting working at the Derby yesterday as a gym session. My body is in agony @reenatailor93

288449373	sinemertansel	2015-06-15 17:13:44	Eaten so much today. I could go to the gym...or I could just carry on eating. I think I know what decision I'll be making.
288449373	sinemertansel	2015-06-15 17:13:54	Food. Always, food.
288449373	sinemertansel	2015-06-15 17:18:25	The best thing about graduate life is the amount of baths I'm having. That's definitely a plus. So fancy with all the bubbles.
288449373	sinemertansel	2015-06-15 17:20:51	@NotSeriousEd because I have a lot more free time now haha
288449373	sinemertansel	2015-06-15 17:27:30	@NotSeriousEd pretty much. Looks like I'm about 80

288449373	sinemertansel	2015-06-17 19:06:01	Is a random man seriously adding me on facebook when it says he is married to another woman on his page? What is wrong with people?
288449373	sinemertansel	2015-06-18 19:38:22	There's a guy at the gym who really looks like you but his beard makes him look like a magician @AlexElFosto
