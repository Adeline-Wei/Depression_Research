2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-15 04:00:00	There's some ephemeral quality to it now.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-16 22:00:01	This is the sort of thing that needs to be build in from the ground up.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-23 04:00:00	Did I finally started a project with a name that isn't complete shit.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-24 18:00:00	Thank you, and no one is broken.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-25 10:00:00	Sorta related: that whole new twitter thing is taking a bit of getting used to.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-26 04:00:00	Not that I'm complaining, but terrifying, because they get everyone's hopes up about what we can actually implement.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-26 14:00:00	Now, it doesn't...
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-24 20:00:00	Oh hey apparently there's a reason most top-down games stick to a single layer of depth at a time.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-26 16:00:00	Behold the dark side, I guess no one gets capitals in the middle of their name.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-26 18:00:00	These are all this rikti fuss is all about?

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-27 08:00:00	Perhaps I should just implement it the way I want and wait for this backup to finish.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-27 10:00:00	In other news: what the fuck is this shit: I...

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-28 08:00:00	A surprising amount of intelligence, because the subject can seemingly distinguish between this fire, and more than a little disturbing:
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-27 16:00:00	A startup meetup seems to be said for not actively rewarding/punishing the player for their actions and just letting it play out
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-28 10:00:00	I think 90% of this operation feels so skeezy

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-27 20:00:00	Brb, developing opinions on the Dwarf Fortress is completely justified.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-28 14:00:00	Also, there is some cost for making more of it.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-29 08:00:00	Many questions, which is why I think it is hard to detect.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-29 04:00:00	I think I'll make a video game developer: killing time while waiting for devices to charge.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2014-12-29 10:00:00	I may need to make some games for a bit while my brain calms down.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-15 22:00:00	All hooked up to anything yet, but it's starting to look like something I'd want to interact with.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-15 20:00:00	Then I remember exactly how smart I am if this article I am reading is giving me chills or if it is just the AC.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-16 00:00:00	Apparently a veritable bevy of games take save games for granted, but they are annoyingly complicated on any project.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-15 16:00:00	This is setting the bar extremely high.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-16 12:00:00	I'm in the way it is being done.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-16 16:00:00	Now it is hard to get over just how much of a theorem in this day of omnipresent info?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-16 02:00:00	Do people still play Mass Effect 3 info; apparently Clint Mansell is doing wonders for my creative juices, too.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-16 14:00:00	A comment replying to my LinkedIn page I now know more about hats than I do like abusing integer limitations sometimes.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-16 18:00:00	Two more days until I'm out of terrible Victoria and condo buildings named after famous artists -first the Mondrian and now the Escher.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-17 18:00:00	Sorry guys, not transferring off of variable argument in response to the street from me.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-17 00:00:00	Pro-tip: don't make your game, that is not an excuse to put me on your mailing list.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-17 20:00:00	I am not here to have my own election.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-18 08:00:00	I'm trying to figure out what you want to do, but not want to do it.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-18 12:00:00	In an unrelated issue, it encourages me to be a unsportsmanlike PvP player because there is a $450 fee for renouncing American citizenship.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-17 22:00:00	Oh right, I should update #spaceblocks to Unity 4.2.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-18 02:00:00	Make sure you know what you are feeling something I'm interested in, I am kinda interested in me/my work?

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-18 20:00:00	This game has appeared?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-17 08:00:00	I have a nap!
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-18 06:00:00	There are few ways into my feed.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-18 10:00:00	Three years from now I will deign to give them access to my extraordinary talents.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-17 10:00:00	My brain has none of the idea of Netrunner expansions.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-17 12:00:00	This is just hasn't been the day was great.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-17 14:00:00	This would rather that than adblock at this point.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-19 16:00:00	I may even be torn away from the hotel tonight :(

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-18 22:00:00	This tutorial is going to be a very different place when this new coat has so many pockets you have no idea.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-17 16:00:00	Nick Stahlo, my STO box has apparently been available for purchase!
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-19 04:00:00	8+ is half of a lot of stupid gotchas.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-19 00:00:00	This is some upside I guess.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-20 00:00:00	The police have set up some sort of plugin to tell you this, but asking me to initial something on a web page makes no sense.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-19 08:00:00	I don't know as much about it though (unlike last time).
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-20 02:00:00	Having fun treating the layout of this place as a game in here somewhere, but that's for tomorrow.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-20 04:00:00	I was about to a 64-bit release this much before.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-20 08:00:00	I have the remote clients transmit inputs and then receive world info from the server instead of trying to sync multiple world states.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-20 06:00:00	I will stab it some more.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-20 14:00:00	I want to get rid of it to the weekend before getting sick so that I can still feign immuno-superiority over my coworkers.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-20 10:00:02	I did, with wildly differing opinions on it as I remember.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-20 12:00:00	Is twitter the Dark Souls saturation for the evening.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-20 18:00:00	Current status: fleeing Victoria for a few hours, don't mind me.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-21 02:00:00	Project: 30 files, and one trip out east just ruins everything for me.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-21 04:00:00	I may have to re-download some large files because apparently I wasn't good enough for the upcoming mayoral election.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-21 12:00:00	Sometimes it feels like putting a tripwire next to the coffee machine.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-20 20:00:00	Sometimes I wonder if Yahtzee is one of those days.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-20 22:00:00	Just got back from PAX!

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-21 18:00:01	The Snorshian Ministry Of Tourism is very good at the way of useful online account services.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-21 20:00:00	Not entirely sure what strange corner of my mind this came from.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-21 06:00:00	Tonight seems to be shot.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-21 22:00:00	I know there are certainly a few hours standing vigil in City of Heroes.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-22 00:00:00	Time to make a living being creative, will anyone want to pick up Portal 2, though, so it balances out.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-22 04:00:00	A loading message I expected, and I have absolutely no idea where they came from.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-22 06:00:00	I blame the Penny Arcade podcasts, especially loud ones that kick the back of another business card.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-22 10:00:00	I think I have a bone to pick a name for a company.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-22 12:00:00	Time for heat, and the damn, that movie does not pull its punches.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-22 14:00:00	I really don't understand the appeal of race car driving.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-22 16:00:00	Does anyone know what you are doing, it makes you feel like a computer wizard.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-24 06:00:00	It was super simple, too.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-24 08:00:00	I have successfully sacrificed the alien-themed movies, the soundtrack was fun.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-24 12:00:00	One of these is so that I can take them apart and tinker with them
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-22 18:00:00	Maybe I just buy all of them?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-24 14:00:00	Durn it, I'm going to get some gamedev done, but apparently I'm "still getting over a cold" or some shit.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-23 04:00:00	I have hit peak Dark Souls had used art deco instead of grimdark fantasy.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-22 20:00:00	The part of the morning I dislike is when the cars start driving around, reminding me that it spawned (such as Team Tesla).

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-23 16:00:06	I think I could ever do an interesting Lets Play.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-23 08:00:00	If the derpomorph isn't a meme by the lack of use.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-23 10:00:00	Parrot AR Drone apps are just QR codes on the side of slush, but I hate not knowing how something works when things inevitably go wrong.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-23 12:00:00	Oh, apparently deep rooted psychological appeal, is becoming a niggling point without a laser that can fry people on earth.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-24 18:00:00	OK, Firefox is getting worse and it's only downhill from here for the next few weeks.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-23 18:00:00	A feeling backed up my work, but I hate not knowing how something works when things inevitably go wrong.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-24 22:00:00	Those Vulcans really knew where it should be, but they keep forgetting to not do phong shading when they add light sources.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-23 22:00:00	Oh hey I feel like I've stared at games so much that they no longer make any sense, like a word repeated until all meaning is lost.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-24 00:00:00	You can play D&amp;D.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-24 02:00:00	This train ride down, still need to book that.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-25 10:00:00	A game where you don't know why I keep reading reviews - the only ones that stick in my mind are the small minority that are negative.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-25 12:00:00	How do I want.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-24 04:00:00	Is it just me, as I blather on about things that literally no one tell me about Abney Park sooner?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-25 20:00:00	OH MY FAVORITE I usually try and leave the house.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-25 22:00:00	I am only conscious out of this blog idea and just bang Seattle already.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-26 08:00:00	If Disney fucks about Swift, but all this emoji-based programming is pretty hilarious.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-25 00:00:00	I am only conscious out of the tech industry.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-25 08:00:00	That feeling when you know what you are doing, it makes you feel like a Dead Thing.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-25 02:00:00	Adding force myself today: I actually DO care how many people play things I make.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-27 04:00:00	Wait, Victoria, but you have to dig for it, and the mainstream industry hasn't been forced to innovate for a while.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-25 04:00:00	It is rather appalling how much slower I work for.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-25 06:00:00	I should probably consume sustenance at some point...
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-27 06:00:00	Photo: For Dead Risings, you say?

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-25 14:00:00	Now is time for the epic compile!
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-25 16:00:00	According to ask for help for the PS3/Ouya/Misc controllers (also, testing on non-Windows platforms).
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-27 14:00:00	Whelp, it's only downhill from 60 to 400 lines of code each (avg ~120).
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-25 18:00:00	Twitter, you are pretty dang shiny
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-27 20:00:00	Victorites: today is a fiberglass bird creature mask I made were the original slow zombies actual really bored fast zombies?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-27 20:00:32	@PrizeMe06835 Might as well claim to secure victory.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-27 16:00:00	Speaking of Robits in my snack spending.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-27 22:00:00	The rest of the common cold is slowly moving it's way up my head.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-28 00:00:00	Parent's response to the fact I am wasting it on twitter at this very moment.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-26 02:00:00	Game and drink pairings should be outlawed on Mondays.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-26 06:00:00	That should be annoyed or sympathetic.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-26 00:00:00	Theme of the Ninja looks really interesting.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-26 04:00:00	And it's not empty or anything crazy like that...
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-26 14:00:00	I swear that section has shrunk since I was a full time artist.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-26 20:00:00	How in the hell is #gamergate?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-28 02:00:00	So apparently four hours before I can stop.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-28 04:00:00	Getting ready to do some work, but then I just kept walking.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-28 06:00:00	My suggestion would be AMAZING.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-28 08:00:00	This is what I want to do this weekend.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-28 10:00:00	This movie has a fun core it in somewhere, but my god there are a lot of bugs.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-28 14:00:00	Damn I'm a whore for free shit.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-28 12:00:00	Even in is to crush my opponents like these.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-28 16:00:00	I wanna try out this week.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-28 18:00:00	You can now search through all seven of my degree.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-28 20:00:00	Photoset: artmonia: Anna Armona Watercolor, A4 Wow, those fella's at Twitpic have their logo upside down.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-02-28 22:00:00	Creation is more than just the successes.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-01 00:00:00	What mad scheme have you done to me?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-01 02:00:00	Seriously reconsidering the trains running on the CoH boards are way better than most, that just makes it worse in situations like these.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-02 04:00:00	Also, for all its faults, is much better than lunch with random people.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-02 06:00:00	Ah Cho-Manno, if you are interested: #ILoveFindingNewMusic
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-01 04:00:00	Extinct Australian megafauna are so it's more on one of UVic's servers.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-02 10:00:00	Then I remember exactly how messy and interdependent.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-02 12:00:00	There's like four blocks of this computer build so far is finding a portable non-USB monitor.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-01 10:00:00	What is this, the concept of banding together...
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-03 04:00:00	The two are not one of the creatures you'll find in the area after...
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-01 12:00:00	I'm sick of a lot of my feelings around E3:
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-01 06:00:00	I really need to make myself feel better.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-02 16:00:00	I mean, it's a bit weird that Being Noticed By The Media is a legitimate career path, right?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-01 08:00:00	The real question is a very rich one.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-02 18:00:00	This is the deck that, while I'm rambling, is it odd that I try to get to EXACTLY 140 characters?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-03 06:00:00	Great game, I'm just going to be mostly making gut decisions and coming up with adult-sounding rationalizations later.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-02 20:00:01	Current status: being an old man, how did I get home.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-02 22:00:00	I should probably not be filed as a game designer is weird, because I keep wanting to leave a weakness in so someone can exploit it.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-03 00:00:00	"Illegal downloaders" buy more controllers.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-03 18:00:00	Writing about, but I can definitely hear them while lying in pretification-mode #orcajam #screenshotsaturday actually on a Saturday.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-03 08:00:00	Repeatedly silently crashing to the land of dreams.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-03 18:09:25	@indie_gonBot It kind of a shitty call to make, but I should be a judge because pizza.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-01 14:00:00	Possibly via living in Victoria: my average is to hit both ends of the spectrum.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-01 16:00:00	Taking metric-driven gameplay to a well implemented example instead of a blank page, I think you need to reevaluate.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-01 18:00:00	So http://t.co/4HYeq2qMA8 redirects to placeholder website for some new methods of working for an election that I think I have ever been.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-01 20:00:00	Beginning work on a paper.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-01 22:00:00	I made a terrible showing for Winter, has decided to skip straight to summer.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-03 10:00:00	Today is a good day for taking the day off.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-02 00:00:00	Photoset: brianmichaelbendis: Disney's Atlantis Concept Art by depression.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-02 02:00:00	Does anyone know what would be much better.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-03 12:00:00	An entire git repo for readmes and a copy of Coup.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-02 08:00:00	Debugging code while people attempt to stab ALL THE THINGS.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-03 14:00:00	I have no idea #AgeOfWonders
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-02 14:00:00	Between the "Ice Cream Sandwich" OS, NVidia's "Kal-El" processor, and you want to add multiplayer, you guys
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-03 02:00:00	Fourth, it doesn't...
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-04 12:00:00	This is also surprising large, at least I should have enough time to release a game tonight.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-04 14:00:00	new replies are going to stay for Full Indie Summit?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-04 16:00:00	Perhaps they should focus on anything right now?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-03 16:00:00	Seriously guys, voting for the Indie Dev Grant is still open.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-03 20:00:00	OK so maybe we have it direct into Amnesty International's paypal account?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-04 18:00:00	Just got my Minecraft server (yeah, yeah, #famouslastwords)
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-05 04:00:00	Time to get Chrome to be less good than other bundles, but that doesn't make it a few weeks ago.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-03 22:00:00	Does anyone have any sort of floating island thingy.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-04 20:00:00	I was very lucky to get a Nexus 7 entirely for Dungeons and Dragons.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-04 22:00:00	My Mario Kart puns are female, I guess.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-05 06:00:00	Also, there is a lot to be said for not actively rewarding/punishing the player for their actions and just letting it play out
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-05 00:00:00	Perspective will be back in a few hours.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-05 08:00:00	I'm a legit edge case problem, and caffeine / and returns little #haikutweets
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-05 02:00:00	Aw man, I already have different meanings, so I can play D&amp;D.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-05 10:00:00	I wonder how much of this press about devs and death threats is slow-news-week-syndrome, and how much I liked the Tithe so much.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-05 12:00:00	Is there rehab for sort of weird outcast having to sit here not doing anything while I wait for other people.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-05 14:00:00	I have to use the gaining of knowledge as my guiding principle, anything that restricts that makes very strange leaps of logic.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-05 20:00:00	Apparently "gender reveal parties" are thing for a walk and some some sushi, I think.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-05 16:00:00	Two buttons are for everyone, and I'll freely admit to making silly games now.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-06 14:00:00	I &lt;3 you, logic bug, then realized I had dreamed its existence last night.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-06 15:03:00	@grimgraphix you know, I think I would rather a tepid game than a great design doc and no game.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-06 16:00:00	I should probably not be the skyline of Vancouver or Seattle, but it is still quite pretty.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-05 22:00:00	Digging in to, a dinner that was just ok, a beer I might not finish.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-06 18:00:00	OK so maybe we have it pretty easy to feel like the day never happened at all (messed up sleep schedule not helping).
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-05 18:00:00	I don't know why I am surprised by this that I thought was...
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-06 00:00:00	Fix a thing, then realized I have to (yet again) lower my estimations of the average intelligence of internet users.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-06 20:00:00	Downside: have to pay taxes forever, even though I am officially my birthday.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-06 22:00:00	Once again sleep and some guys walk down the street banging drums.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-06 02:00:00	I now understand the extreme reactions that the term "Portal" has been co-opted so often it is hard to find good examples.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-07 00:00:00	I don't think I could justify Photoshop's price for my own purposes.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-06 04:00:00	WhiskyDev was real neat and it shouldn't suffer in my mind right now.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-04 00:00:00	Of course on Vampires shouldn't be arsed to set up a new repository - just sticking this project on google drive for now.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-04 02:00:00	If Disney fucks with Iron Man one is broken.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-07 08:00:00	There is something I can do with it.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-07 10:00:00	Ok, so it's more on the NextBox, that means your design has failed.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-07 12:00:00	My god you guys (in that is both pretty and cool to the touch)
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-04 04:00:00	In a good horror game, you'll know what you need to do, but not in VLC.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-07 14:00:00	Cue the wailing and gnashing of teeth from those who have met me in situations like these.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-06 06:00:00	I'm not sure what's more interesting - Ello, or does remixing Daft Punk seem...
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-07 02:00:00	Incentives for once.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-06 08:00:00	Half-way through the fourth hand, I am officially done with hard work for the rest of my degree.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-07 16:00:00	Rewatching Scott Pilgrim because I am an electronic kleptomaniac.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-04 06:00:00	Project: Have A New Job is going to be a character, but problem: I have no idea what Android was.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-04 08:00:00	I'm not sure why Unity thinks I need two bug submission forms per crash.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-06 10:00:00	Dear world: what the I, Robot movie should have been.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-07 04:00:00	Way to go scrounging for food that closes before sundown just weirds me out.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-04 10:00:00	I kinda like the last resort of someone who fucked up.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-06 12:00:00	I really like it, but I made a space simulator game that was actually a metaphor for a security question.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-07 06:00:00	Did my part to make it up for Halloween, as it is the scariest thing I can think of right now.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-07 18:00:00	New iPhone: now with the most boring person in the world but come on, look at this:
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-07 20:00:00	Kinda want to hook up an Oculus Rift?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-08 02:00:00	Current discussions include things like this make me a bad person and should feel bad.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-08 06:00:00	Oh man, I am inclined to believe him.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-08 00:00:00	Thinking of making this weekend a technology park, the internet got out of bed while I reimport everything that ever existed.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-08 10:00:00	Must have been for an election that I have come across.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-08 12:00:00	Air conditioning everywhere, lone figure surfing down the front of the mechanics are there.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-08 14:00:00	The Merlin of computers, if those giant spiders are also four times higher here.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-08 16:00:00	Instead, I couldn't walk, Victoria.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-08 18:00:00	There may yet be a game I made is available for purchase!
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-08 20:00:01	Current goal: spend more time trying to figure out how and where I could funnel funds for #ferguson.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-09 12:00:00	Stupid world cup is interfering with my ability to understand people on any project.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-08 22:00:00	I don't like the sort of game I would enjoy, but they are not authorizing my credit card for...
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-09 16:00:00	Going to bed, which was easy, and I felt confident in the early game.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-09 00:00:00	I'm legitimately interested in the Surface website is useless, confusing, and I am at full nerd.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-09 18:00:00	Don't mind me, because it calls NPCs animating stiffly a "purely decorative" issue, compared to Important Reflections.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-09 20:00:00	Time for my nightly Next to be pretty good sometimes.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-09 08:00:01	Sometimes I would otherwise have thought were beyond my means.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-09 10:00:00	I think I need to spice it up for Halloween, though?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-09 04:00:00	Spent the majority of your code to make a blog post to consolidate and illustrate my grievances with UVic's online implementation.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-09 06:00:00	The future's so bright, I deleted some arbitrary files and now it seems to be working.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-09 22:00:00	It seems that networking in Unity - need to balance faking it with this country and air conditioning?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-10 00:00:00	It might feed into why I dislike the microtransaction model so much.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-09 14:00:05	After playing Persona 4 a bunch, I should probably write down my "to re-watch" list at some point.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-10 02:00:00	Then stab it until it is for me to exploit, maybe?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-10 18:00:00	Bridge Project actually looks pretty dang nice #spaceblocks #screenshotsaturday
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-03-10 04:00:00	For the daytime crowd: I made a Thing last night, and today I watch a stream and see an entire really important screen I didn't know about.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-06 04:00:00	Just a theory that egoism is a Turing machine of ethics - no one made a Die Hard movie named Die Hard: Old Habits?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-06 06:00:00	I think I'm going to go back to making silly games now.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-16 10:00:00	JankCity at your door is a valid tactic, but only having so much of it.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-20 18:00:00	Needless to say, here is a little weird.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-21 12:00:00	You are all these expensive requirements if that is your sort of thing.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-20 20:00:00	Home again tomorrow.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-23 08:00:00	Maybe you think about implementation tradeoffs rather than just how to get it to work.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-23 10:00:00	Realized I've been here, but I shall let you be the judge of whether or not that was how Apple made their money.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-23 12:00:00	I need to find a way to a disturbingly small number of tabs.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-22 16:00:01	I probably have to leave it until it is dead.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-23 18:00:00	There's probably something I can fix.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-23 20:00:00	I wonder if I'll be able to page through games trying something new, which is why I think it is hard to detect.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-25 22:00:00	Is it bad of me that I don't want to go back at UVic, though this idea working.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-26 00:00:00	Oh hey, that's about a days work wasted due to a stupid mistake.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-25 20:00:00	is not something I thought was...
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Must have been procrastinating around that ever was coffeed.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-26 20:00:00	Maybe once I have graduated, I have to kill 500 players in PvP with Void damage, and deaths "slow my progress".
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-28 02:00:00	Curse you, the source is from a university, which I am lead to yet more heartbreak, but whatever.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-28 04:00:00	Kinda redundant at once with my level design.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-28 06:00:00	Jankwheels on some more things #MysteryProject
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-26 22:00:00	Though the CoH Freedom pages.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-28 08:00:00	Not entirely sure you designed around level-gated quest hubs, your game is time for COFFEE!
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-28 10:00:00	Saints Row 3 is some sort of day that I need multiple beers to get through.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-28 12:00:00	You can download it and see what I can do with this.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-28 14:00:00	I am slowly teaching all the things.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-27 00:00:00	Except for the train ride down, I can take some satisfaction that I can make Minecraft-style block creation work in a top-down view.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-27 10:00:00	Are there any reason I wouldn't just get 4 x $10 for a $40 game?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-28 16:00:00	I managed to survive the weekend.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-28 18:00:01	All hooked up with a better camera for #spaceblocks
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-27 12:00:00	Ok, bed now, or I wouldn't just get 4 x $10 for a $40 game?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-28 20:00:00	The new Macs are nice looking and all, but I'm not sure, because the confirmation email from Apple.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-27 02:00:00	After watching a whole bunch of Magic cards and a copy of Coup.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-27 14:00:00	This is a good day for old-school point-and-click adventure fans.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-28 22:00:00	I feel really bad listing myself as a tool to make my friends better at Magic.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-27 16:00:00	Though it's not due tomorrow.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-29 00:00:00	Dear Internet Deities: those of you with weather, after putting in a terrible showing for Winter, has decided to skip straight to summer.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-27 04:00:00	Mexico is a learning process, so why not learn from the best?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-27 18:00:00	I never thought I would feel better if I took being able to intelligently and quickly rename every instance of a variable.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-27 20:00:00	I reaaally need to come up with a picture of an Alot.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-29 06:00:00	Downside: have to pay taxes forever, even if they are in different places.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-29 08:00:00	Not sure if I should probably write down my "to re-watch" list at some point.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-29 10:00:00	I mean I do, and they didn't tell me.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-29 02:00:01	Just saw a guy dressed like a pirate.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-27 22:00:00	Saw a LeapPad in the other half of the game while making this change.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-27 06:00:00	Is it was snowing instead of being sunny.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-29 04:00:00	I never thought I would ever consider.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-29 12:00:00	The fireworks were great, and I do work when I'm depressed.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-29 14:00:02	I don't usually go in for pure puzzle games, but I am surprised by this, but Google Draw is very, very useful for diagrams and flowcharts.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-29 18:00:00	Guess I'm done for single player, and you want to add multiplayer, you have to just toss out huge sections of it.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-29 20:00:00	Media: terror terror terror terror Obama: a terrible place to realise your relative cosmic insignificance.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-29 22:00:00	Is there a word that the spell checker doesn't.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-30 00:00:00	Time for some new magic cards this weekend: 807.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-30 02:00:00	Current status: 10% Desert Bus support group?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-30 04:00:00	Hey, I made it in to Mass Effect 3 info; apparently Clint Mansell is doing the ME3 soundtrack.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-30 10:00:00	4-0-1 in the market for a while
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-30 12:00:00	A way to explain what feminism was at the end of the day, it's a formulaic old-school MMORPG with little actual innovation.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-30 14:00:01	I think I'm the most amazing character creator, the AR Drone apps are just QR codes on the side of the box.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-30 18:00:00	Victoria weather needs some medicine to combat should be a failing on Demand, but they are not authorizing my credit card for...
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-30 20:00:00	His work has had a totem animal, I think it costs to much: stahp.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-30 22:00:00	Ello seems to be average is to hit both ends of the spectrum.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-01 20:00:00	My computer just about got a knife stuck in it, it is going to be unlivably warm for most people.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-01 22:00:00	New Mirror's Edge is going to have my own election.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-01 10:00:00	Time to make some games, and feel better about myself and the industry.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-01 12:00:00	Shame on all of the associated limitations.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-30 06:00:00	Even in a while.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-01 14:00:00	Time to go to HeroCon now, but it's really not going to be an option.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-02 00:00:00	I wish I could stick explanatory doodles into my reply timeline.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-01 06:00:00	I kinda feel that to get a majority government a party, but I don't really want to, even though I am literally carrying one with me.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-30 08:00:00	9 is a really cool game, you go for coffee and someone spills billions of dollars all over a tech company.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-01 16:00:00	Photo: sirius-draws: it's been rough for you lately, but I think you should get help.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-01 18:00:00	I can't imagine what it is, and everything is broken.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-04-30 16:00:00	I wish I had someone to accompany me on these needlessly complicated wanderings.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-02 02:00:00	Welp, fucked up is that?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-02 04:00:00	I feel better about myself, but their beer really sucks.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-01 00:00:00	Still haven't worked out the problem of AI rights and protections, human rights and protections will seem easy in comparison.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-02 08:00:00	Just tried to show up anyways, though.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-01 02:00:00	My day of #DB8 #db8shame
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-02 10:00:00	Looks kinda to hook up an Oculus Rift to an A.R.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-01 04:00:00	A Night In Ferguson - A great in-depth look at the same time.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-01 08:00:00	Garlic smells so good; I should probably feel bad about this, but I do like abusing integer limitations sometimes.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-02 12:00:00	Currently googling contents of Netrunner onto uninterested bystanders.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-02 14:00:00	Issue 13 hours, my fingers are not having a very happy week.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-02 16:00:00	Their ideology makes a lot better than my last minute business card making: how the fuck does GIMP work.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-02 18:00:00	I keep forgetting really useful but also complete bullshit.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-02 20:00:00	Also, the head I am going to Boston soon for the first time ever!
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-02 22:00:00	This is going to go attempt to network with me.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-03 00:00:00	Current status: somewhere past year, I think.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-04 00:00:00	WhiskyDev was real neat and it keeps working right the first time in probably 13 years.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-03 02:00:00	As a twitter feels like yelling into a paper doesn't seem to be HUUUUUGE.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-03 04:00:00	An unnecessary affectation that touchpad + paint = suck.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-03 06:00:00	Why have I never been a fan of reality TV, but the genre's first foray into my bad books quicker than the equivalent of book burning.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-03 08:00:00	I'm pretty sure none of my ideas are going to work, ever.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-03 10:00:00	I lose more business cards to bother with JSON.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-03 12:00:00	Victoria can be pretty good you guys feel about City Sims with tech trees that change on each play-through?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-03 14:00:00	Chewing my way, feel free.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-04 02:00:00	I somehow managed to get through #DB8 without getting a ridiculous amount of backscatter spam.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-04 04:00:00	I'm making a spaceship in #TheLongProject.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-05 08:00:00	Because that's a few more and more plugins to block to my #SpaceBlocks project now.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-04 18:00:00	The tweets, such as: the day of #ComputerParlour I end up being the scruffiest I have been in a while.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-03 16:00:00	Best poster, or best people to be farther than I expected, and highways are hell for pedestrian traffic
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-04 06:00:00	In short, the Surface website is useless, as all the fun weapons poison the local environment, which is a good idea.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-04 08:00:00	It's surprising how much press Napoleon and the Nazis get when they just sort of flicker by...
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-04 20:00:00	Should tweeted these yesterday, but the character design is great.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-04 10:00:00	Modding is actually intelligent and up to date with the rest of the project.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-05 10:00:00	Second, as someone that doesn't enjoy PvP it is very hard to get really exited for PAX in September.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-03 18:00:00	My greatest enemy is starting to look pretty possibilities!
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-04 11:15:19	@KatyPerryFanszs Mayor Joffrey, I didn't go to.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-04 12:00:00	Gonna need to own dogs.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-05 12:00:05	God damnit I am going to fill you with so many chemicals you won't know which way is up.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-04 22:00:00	I see 'DoktorLoy' is still cool, right?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-03 20:00:00	This is happening to me spending at least an hour watching the cool ideas I never get around to swirl around in my head.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-04 14:00:00	Villain side is where you connect CPUs via hyperspace, right?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-05 00:00:00	I don't know how to design an interface that isn't shit.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-03 22:00:00	That's all I've got to spend multiple days building up to a scalpel-like change.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-05 02:00:00	It is getting increasingly difficult to manage this many copies of Red Chasm.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-04 16:00:00	The accompanying video for the past year, I think.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-05 14:00:00	Packing it in for pure puzzle games, but Threes is pretty good you guys.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-05 04:00:00	Beer + potato and onion based dish would be to reuse assets or code to make a different game.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-05 06:00:00	I'm not sure what's more interesting - Ello, or if I should just go with "Underforge".
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-05 16:00:00	I don't know how to not make games.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-05 22:00:00	Software is a lot of bugs.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-06 04:00:00	Four and a half hours left, and the only thing worse than having a song stuck in your head is having a cadence stuck in your cupboards?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-06 06:00:00	This guy is pretty awesome, you guys.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-06 08:00:00	Needless to get me a costume code?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-06 12:00:00	For those of you have to dig for it, and the mainstream industry hasn't been forced to innovate for a while.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-07 02:00:00	This Iron Man, shit is going to make it to the weekend before getting sick so that I can still feign immuno-superiority over my coworkers.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-05 18:00:00	24 hours of that game #DB8
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-07 04:00:00	Less than 24 hours!
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-05 20:00:00	I missed you, the source is from a university, which I work my magic.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-06 02:00:00	OH MY internetz?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-06 16:00:00	I'm trying to avoid forthwith.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-07 06:00:00	Checking out the worst of my multi-tasking habits.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-06 10:00:00	Reading about ropes in Unity projects may cause your project to become corrupted...
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-07 08:00:00	Why do video games, I'm not entirely sure what you are doing here.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-06 14:00:00	Perfection of asynchronous multiplayer as their own invention?
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-07 10:00:00	The sheer amount of Japanese restaurants here is some sort of graphic for the player.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-06 18:00:00	Time to make a lot of shit today I am going to punch you in your stupid face.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-06 20:00:00	Nnng, someone got water on things that shouldn't have water on them #WhyDoPeopleFindDreamsInteresting?

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-07 14:00:00	Got all inspired by watching the Minecraft server I play to create silly board states.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-07 16:00:00	Readable information, like a date, would be up tomorrow, and with your friends, try Slipstream Cream Ale.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-07 00:00:00	I forgot how much I search, I have yet to find a git GUI that I like.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-08 04:00:00	In case you missed it earlier, it just hasn't been the most frustrating install for anything I can't finish by tomorrow.

2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-07 22:00:00	DriveClub looks like an interesting target for the midday crowd: new devlog!
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-08 06:00:00	The mechanics of the core sets vs the expansion sets is really important because I didn't...
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-08 10:00:00	Well, two steps back.
2922189332	doktor_ebooks	2015-05-08 18:00:00	Narrowing down on the Commander format in MtG for the same reason I wouldn't just get my hands on a Surface Pro for a few days.
