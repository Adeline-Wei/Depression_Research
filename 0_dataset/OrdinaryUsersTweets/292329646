292329646	Richard_Belcher	2012-07-29 20:30:11	pathetic the lengths people will go to in order to win arguments. Not an indirect because that usually implies a minority in the cross-hairs

292329646	Richard_Belcher	2012-07-31 19:08:13	@prcornelissen Oh yeah it was one of the best films I've ever seen. But heard people say negatives now and I don't want to discover any!

292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-02-13 21:48:30	Ronaldo can jump higher than the average NBA player. Fact
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-02-13 21:49:01	@TomWhittaker21 I hope I terrify you
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-02-14 00:06:34	@rickygervais Derek is brilliant. It must be so easy for Karl to play his role though?

292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-04-30 18:16:31	@GreatWhiteHarry I hope it doesn't end up in the Drakey ford
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-04-30 18:45:30	Come on Madrid
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-04-30 19:05:51	@McGorrigan @reggie_rayy he is
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-04-30 19:08:27	I think Modric could be the star of this game
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-04-30 19:32:58	@McGorrigan top scorer in the CL, if he scores tonight he gets the record. Wrong mate.
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-04-30 19:33:26	@McGorrigan you're just another Messi dickrider!!
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-04-30 19:35:23	@McGorrigan you just said Ronaldo has nothing on him. Even if some pundits are right they put Ronaldo a close second behind Messi in world..
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-04-30 19:37:17	@McGorrigan obv didn't. Hiding for you Charles
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-04-30 19:45:37	@McGorrigan yeah that's why I prefer Ronny. On paper Ronaldo scores a lot Messi just scores more
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-04-26 23:54:02	Saw a McLaren P1 on the motorway today. Only 900k worth of car

292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-04-30 19:52:49	Oh my god
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-04-30 19:54:59	Ronaldo looks about 21 tonight

292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-09-17 22:25:51	Xavi said Paul Scholes was the greatest midfielder in the last 20 years and Zidane said he was his hardest opponent, complete midfielder...
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-09-17 22:25:56	.... and the best midfielder of his generation.
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-09-17 22:26:35	Jamie Carragher you have just gone down in my estimation. Biased Liverpool pundit
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-09-17 22:38:35	@McGorrigan dunno about that but tbf I just though carra's points were shit and he annoyed me. I think gerrard is better all round...
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-09-17 22:38:49	@McGorrigan  ... As he can tackle well and scholes can't at all
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-09-17 22:39:23	@AshBurty yeah but aren't pundits meant to try and give balanced arguments?
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2013-09-17 22:40:36	@AshBurty @McGorrigan ha Burty has spoken. We all know who worlds best player is anyway

292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-07-29 15:53:16	If anyone would like to cook for me for the next few nights, I can pay in a variety of different ways
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-03 10:09:04	Coco Pops Rocks: great tasting, love the contrast between the crunchy and soft rocks, however lack of good chocolate milk at the end. 8/10
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-03 10:09:16	@JamieEMurray you've always been a sneaky one 😈
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-02 10:35:34	@I3ashyy the only way is drakey
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-04 21:45:39	Crunchy Bran: high in fibre, bland in taste. 6/10
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-04 21:57:48	@KTommo_ I don't take cereal advice, I give it

292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-05 06:40:23	TESCO Fruit and Fibre: a healthy blend of dried fruit and wheat flakes, however lack of sugar and sex appeal. 7/10
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-05 06:43:24	@AshBurty it's not far behind, just too boring for me
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-05 06:45:40	Liverpool fans were quiet early this morning, I'm guessing United won
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-09 09:15:55	@Nicky_Dunne which peak?
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-10 18:58:25	About to watch Lone Survivor. I've heard good things
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-09 18:36:21	@Nicky_Dunne ahh I did that last year. Nice walk!
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-12 19:04:55	I predict Bale will be greedy this season

292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-11 20:55:58	Wheetabix Crispy Minis Chocolate Chip: only negative is that they don't make boxes big enough. Incredibly moorish. 9/10
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-14 06:35:44	Absolutely gutted
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-13 16:12:23	@AneeshBhatt @hayner21 @MattJHancock need 3 or 4 people to play Footie tonight 8-9

292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-17 20:21:22	@SamCrossss you need cement powder. You can mix it with cornflower or oat powder and they'll eat it and die

292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-28 16:31:19	I'd pay hundreds to see Ronaldo boom a hattrick past the scousers
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-08-31 20:14:39	If you thought flappy bird was frustrating, download swing copter. I almost smashed my phone into a million pieces after 5 mins

292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-09-20 18:42:47	Pale is cool
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-09-23 20:03:51	7 goals in 3 days. Bow down to the god of football that is @Cristiano
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-09-23 20:03:57	@AshBurty you have no idea
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-09-25 22:21:41	What a day. Tired is an understatement
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-09-30 18:12:12	People say I look like Doctor Manhattan
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-10-02 11:49:49	Why is my dad listening to 'hot in here' by Nelly on repeat?
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-10-03 21:27:17	Geezer in the club last night told me I look like Opie from Sons of Anarchy. I'll take that as a compliment

292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-11-04 21:01:33	Great solid challenge from Ramos
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-11-04 21:33:22	Arsenal game was so much more interesting than this one
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-11-04 19:40:40	The words 'lamb' and 'slaughter' come to mind
292329646	Richard_Belcher	2014-11-08 17:38:05	Cannot believe North Korea has released all US detainees
