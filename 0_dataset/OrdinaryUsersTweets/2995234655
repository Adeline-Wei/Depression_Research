2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-11 22:22:50	@TipseeCake So. So very.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-11 22:26:18	@TipseeCake @Pasty_Swag ... rude.

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-13 18:55:09	@TipseeCake I was sorta hoping you'd forget that whole thing.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-15 01:48:41	@UnholyTemptress @Dick_Hammer1 Gorging on mashed potatoes competitively absolutely counts as foreplay in my book.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-15 20:34:20	@TipseeCake It must be 60 here, at least. I was wearing a hoodie but it's a little warm for that.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-15 16:46:43	@JimmyNintendo @Dick_Hammer1 I'm going to be eating all day. Halfway into tomorrow I'm going to starve myself. He can't hang with this.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-15 17:26:00	@TipseeCake YESSSSS. The only way I could help you is if you had a problem. All I see is a solution.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-17 00:00:48	@MarkgMendez @Dick_Hammer1 No, PoppaDick will shame us both. Dick will cry and pee when he loses.

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-18 07:26:45	@Grizzliology @TipseeCake @Dick_Hammer1 I will supply the arrows and fuel. Boats are hard to come by, however. We can spare few.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-17 18:52:27	@xelubest Ad banners. "Invite 5 friends for exclusive tomato seeds!" Question why one needs tomato seeds in an FPS. Deploy. Profit.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-17 19:04:43	@Psychobilly2422 "Pls, sideburns senpai!" is my new favorite phrase to wake up to.

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-22 06:28:48	@Grizzliology I like meeting new people, but if it's a prearranged meeting... I hear ya.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-22 07:41:27	@Bearcoon47 May his chops be legendary and his skin be luminous.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-20 05:26:44	@UnholyTemptress You should secretly place ashtrays around his house and report him. No more yelling neighbors!

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-25 21:17:32	@TipseeCake What kind of a wizard was I?
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-25 22:11:34	@TipseeCake Hopefully the other wizards will cannibalize him and gain my voice, and the power that comes with it.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-26 00:55:37	@TipseeCake It's commonplace for wizards, don't worry.

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-31 19:46:32	@UnholyTemptress I guess that's forgivable. I was totally looking forward to watching you not sprint again though &lt;/3
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-31 19:57:25	@UnholyTemptress Oh, Unholy... will you be playing it again soon?
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-03-31 20:36:31	@UnholyTemptress I'll be there.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-04-02 03:59:02	@Dick_Hammer1 The only reasons we need are the promotion #cheesepies and basic logic.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-04-03 18:07:45	@vladwes @TipseeCake I thought Romania was known for putting internet above all else. Oh well, just one more reason to move to the US!
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-04-03 19:36:30	@vladwes @TipseeCake That stings.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-04-04 14:36:04	@TipseeCake I wish there was something I could say to make things better. Take care of yourself and don't lose sight of those who love you.

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-04-04 19:27:51	@Dick_Hammer1 I had that 2 days ago. My head hurt so bad I thought I was going to puke. I advise 4 hour naps at 11 am.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-04-04 19:30:58	@Grizzliology What if I make the initial purchase and you take care of maintenance fees while I deface it?
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-04-04 19:32:24	@Dick_Hammer1 It's #2015, son! No need for in-person communication these days. Also I'm very comfortable.

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-04-09 19:53:31	@TipseeCake At least you're not on fire!

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-04-19 22:16:56	@TipseeCake OMG You actually took physics?! We need to talk. Seriously, I need help. Even if you can just point out things, it would help.

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-04-29 02:58:20	Bubble bath time with @Dick_Hammer1 ! http://t.co/hn2iiIrXsx
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-04-29 22:57:30	@theoldvulpine Is that a legit low-poly model? And did you do it yourself?
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-01 01:46:04	I spent so long trying to, and succeeding in, solving a problem that I forgot what the problem was. I don't even understand what that means.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-02 03:34:55	Today I grilled meat and unlocked like 4 new items and 1 new char in @RiskofRain, and ALMOST killed the final boss. Fuck yeah.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-02 06:19:44	@TipseeCake Grilling meat.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-01 01:21:37	@allthingsgoboom ships with beer: confirmed. And it has destructible environments. Pretty excited for it.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-02 16:46:36	I woke up to my bed rocking. I wish I could take credit for that.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-02 17:09:22	@TipseeCake FUCK YEAH IT IS
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-02 17:32:38	Splines and vector curves, or @Mustard_Plug ... A decision I have not been prepared to make.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-02 17:34:41	I NEED A FUCKING FRACTAL @fractal_bot !
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-02 21:49:04	@Kotaku @tha_rami What the fuck is a GamerGate meetup? What would they do?
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-02 21:53:27	@tha_rami @Kotaku But... does it need to be labeled as a specifically GamerGate meetup? Can't it be just people chillin? #hiddenagendas?!?!
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-02 21:55:14	@tha_rami @Kotaku Which is incredibly unfortunate. That is top-notch irony. It sucks because, seriously, bomb threats? But the irony rules.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-02 21:58:16	@TheIvyClover1 @Kotaku I'm all about fighting unethical things, but this is out of control, and has been. Death threats, bomb threats. Damn.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-02 21:59:48	@tha_rami @Kotaku Seriously, no matter anyone's views on GamerGate or almost anything, for that matter, bomb threats should NOT be happening
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-02 22:01:23	@TessaVermilyea @tha_rami nailed it. Nothing cool about threatening lives in the least, and I apologize if I came off that way.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-02 22:04:20	@tha_rami @Kotaku Same. I don't get it. I'm just gonna play Ocarina of Time and code.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-02 22:19:51	@TessaVermilyea @tha_rami Ah, np. Understandable misunderstandings all around! NOTHING is ok about threats. Thanks for the chance to clarify
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-03 23:08:03	@moveordiegame The music!!

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-03 07:18:25	Today I ate food, optimized a hefty bit, and went to a ska show. Fuck yeah, today.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-03 09:22:02	5 am numbness, my old friend.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-03 07:04:10	@action_pts @tha_rami @Kotaku Why is it "us" and "them"? Why are there labels? I get standing for right and wrong, but why stand separate?
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-04 03:47:20	Gonna get my stream on with @Dick_Hammer1! Watch us miss jumps! http://t.co/eU1c3JZT6K
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-04 19:08:28	@bryanveloso @limedaring I've never done web development before so I might look into this. But why Python and Django as opposed to C#/Java?
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-03 15:51:36	@tha_rami I just don't get it.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-03 15:57:59	@UnholyTemptress Wait until they ask "Why shouldn't we hire you?"
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-04 08:02:06	@IndieLuchador IT WAS 1:54 AM
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-04 19:20:51	@IndieLuchador You said "good afternoon" at 2 am, and I felt like giving you #shit for it.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-04 19:23:11	@limedaring @bryanveloso Ah, fair enough. I kinda figured but I've never used Python. Congrats on the release, and thanks for the response!
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-04 19:47:03	Jesus I hate buzzfeed.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-03 17:38:06	Two projects going right now, and I'm reallt tempted to try duplicating Risk of Rain from scratch.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-05 00:41:35	I swear to god no one has touched my code since Saturday. It works better now than the last time I touched it. #indiedev #lessworkmoprogress
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-05 20:54:33	It's dangerous to go alone! Take my fucking keys for some reason. http://t.co/3J0BWObIm3

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-07 20:02:27	LF more PAX Prime tickets, PST! Seriously though, we need more. PLEASE let me know if anyone has some extras.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-08 18:03:37	I just had a realistic Lovecraftian Risk of Rain dream that took place on a local lake. I don't want anything as much as I want that game.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-08 01:19:43	@toadthetoad @Dick_Hammer1 Gross.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-09 20:54:34	@bryanveloso I got that 2:50 pm swag goin on right now.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-09 22:19:01	@TipseeCake This is America. I am near a McDonald's, and so are you.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-10 22:38:50	Do you or does anyone you know have experience programming a realistic (ish) 3D rope? PLEASE, let me know!
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-10 11:12:07	My head is splitting and there might be a spider on my leg.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-11 20:06:24	Thank you, @TipseeCake, for getting me addicted to Penny Dreadful. God damn it.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-10 23:57:04	@Dick_Hammer1 @iKasperr TAKE THE FUCKING CIRCUS PEANUTS
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-11 23:40:12	@CN_Monoxide Everybody's got bills...
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-11 01:30:52	@lizbythewrench I have unique tastes, Lizby.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-15 00:04:09	@CN_Monoxide I was looking at Not A Hero... looks interesting. Hotline Miami is kinda... eh for me, tbh. Thanks for the suggestions man.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-13 17:39:01	@AckkStudios Mmmm... Unity.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-13 17:43:32	@rkt227 Fuck yeah. I love seeing hard work go into pointless shit, and THEN seeing it work. So satisfying and hilarious.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-13 19:32:46	@rkt227 Noice. I never got into HTML/CSS, and I'm kicking myself for it now. I highly recommend looking into Javascript and C# after a while
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-14 21:34:49	PEOPLE OF TWITTER: Please recommend games for me to play. Risk of Rain clones encouraged.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-15 04:31:39	@tha_rami So I played Nuclear Throne tonight for the first time. And the second. And the third. And the fourth...
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-15 05:44:40	@TipseeCake All the good movies ARE porn.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-16 01:00:30	@UnholyTemptress I'm already drinking!
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-16 16:11:53	@Psychobilly2422 NO! You're better than that, Sheena. #abovetheinfluence
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-16 16:15:32	@Psychobilly2422 Sheena, people need memes like they need overdraft fees.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-16 02:38:27	@UnholyTemptress I set the curve. #hititgitit

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-17 01:53:31	Just shot an AK. Today was a good day.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-17 05:43:48	@TipseeCake Well that was fucked up.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-17 05:45:29	@MarkgMendez Badass and manly as fuck. Shot a 9 mm pistol too for the first time. AND I just had grilled cheese, courtesy of @TipseeCake
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-17 20:22:07	Power's been out for 2 hours, 17 minutes. God damn it.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-17 19:31:51	@Grizzliology I just puked at that memory.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-17 19:34:21	@MarkgMendez Oh, all over the place. I RARELY shoot, and the AK wasn't sighted properly, AND his scope's batteries were dead. Still fun.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-18 20:59:20	@MANvsGAME Right there with ya. After seeing the new one (and reading the books twice), it would take effort for me to care about the show.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-19 03:46:52	Quality recordings over here... @Dick_Hammer1 http://t.co/obbfHanptc
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-20 09:34:38	@tha_rami @notch @locust9 I have multiple copies of my favorite books so I can force them upon the unsuspecting passerby.

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-20 16:16:46	@CN_Monoxide How so?
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-20 19:21:40	@UnholyTemptress DESTINY. I had so much fucking fun with that game. I guarantee you'll get more than $30 out of it.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-20 20:02:20	@CN_Monoxide NO IT WASN'T! It was totally informative, included links to multiple sources, and had more than 2 sentences per item.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-20 20:03:13	@CN_Monoxide I read it exclusively on mobile, and have beeb every night for years. Wanna know how many ads they have? One. One tiny bar.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-20 20:04:15	@CN_Monoxide Clickbait is about generating ad revenue through misleading titles. That title was true to the article. I will fight about this
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-23 20:54:26	@Dick_Hammer1 @BallsOfSteelTV RISK OF RAIN
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-23 18:36:20	@UnholyTemptress How can you not leave the apartment?! You're basically in an episode of 24, except not as disappointed.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-22 20:05:02	Perfect Dark has been better than Goldeneye for 15 years today!

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-24 23:14:19	@Ezekiel_III I once woke up with a condom on, rockin one sock, alone, and in my one bed. I feel ya. #andrewwkaintgotshit
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-28 01:36:10	@TipseeCake Of COURSE you did :'(
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-28 01:40:50	@lucasdnd What *exactly* are you trying to do? Like, what problem are you trying to solve?
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-27 15:20:16	@TipseeCake Nice! It only took a week of saying "... sacred heart?! Damn."

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-28 20:36:34	@lucasdnd Haha, that's probably true, but a calc course might help. Yeah, I'm thinking about a sort of sphere casting if joints don't work.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-28 17:19:18	@lucasdnd Ahh, damn, that's a little out of my league ;)
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-28 17:21:16	@lucasdnd I've been working on a grappling hook system, and one consideration was to use a point-gravity system to simulate an orbit.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-28 17:22:19	@lucasdnd What you were tweeting seemed similar to a few things I've considered, but astrodynamics are juuuust a little ways ahead of me.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-28 17:30:15	@Dick_Hammer1 I myself have eaten 2.5 pizzas. It took half of that chicken bbq for me to call it quits. Good luck with the rest, I'm out.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-30 03:44:56	@TipseeCake TOTALLY just got Sacred Heart. On the last level of a fucking challenge.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-31 10:40:29	Just had a 4.5 hour @RiskofRain run with @Dick_Hammer1. 821 items later, we were explosive, electric, laggy eagles. Such a great game.

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-05-31 16:30:50	@Evryxx Yeah, finally. It came back at like... 3-4 a.m. Comcast said it would be back at 10 p.m.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-02 01:14:33	@UnholyTemptress I like how you're not even putting on makeup; you're "trying" to.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-01 03:01:56	@TipseeCake I'm 6 feet away, in my bedroom. You message me on steam to tell me something, as opposed to getting up. I like you.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-02 23:46:01	Catfish... what a great show.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-03 21:54:17	@UnholyTemptress Well, I wasn't entirely alone. You were in my heart, keeping me warm &lt;3

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-04 22:25:35	@fractal_bot I could totally use a fractal right now.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-04 22:30:51	@fractal_bot Mmm... that's a damn fine fractal ya got there...
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-03 17:33:19	@UnholyTemptress I honestly just said "what the fuck" out loud. I'm alone in my bed.

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-04 07:52:36	@notch Was the... Fallout... too much to handle?
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-05 16:06:39	@UnholyTemptress Agreed.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-04 13:39:52	@UnholyTemptress While you're at work, I might take a nap.

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-07 19:51:47	@TipseeCake HOW DO YOU SLEEP WITH ALL THAT. Do you contort your body around all those pillows like a lizard? Yes, I choose to believe that.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-09 12:56:30	@Dick_Hammer1 might be the first to watch Teen Titans while smoking Marlboro Red 100s. I feel like the majority of viewers smoke Camels.

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-10 03:20:39	@TipseeCake It's the internet. Expect it.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-10 03:26:53	@TipseeCake Ohhh shit! I knew that name sounded familiar! And I think we actually watched the episode where she died together. Way to suck.

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-13 00:25:41	@lizbythewrench DARK SOULS. I fully agree with @FoxwellGNR. Dark souls is lyfe.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-13 19:22:09	@vladwes @Twitch @YouTubeGaming Seriously, best response to anything.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-13 19:23:25	And that marks the first time I have accidentally crashed a computer since highschool. #drawcallsarefun
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-13 19:32:53	Aaaaand there's the second...
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-14 20:50:43	@theoldvulpine I've never heard that song in my life, but that will NOT come between me and a tasty $50.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-12 15:35:07	@rkt227 Always a plus.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-12 15:42:29	@Grizzliology Fucking agreed. Finally being able to sleep but fighting through swells of sweat... the worst.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-12 15:44:51	@vladwes God damn it... I forgot about Mount Your Friends. I was happier and healthier then.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-12 19:03:31	@TipseeCake I spilled a bottle of water on mine yesterday. Works flawlessly.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-12 19:03:58	@TipseeCake If this phone were a woman I'd marry it and not feel weird about fucking it.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-13 14:48:39	@TipseeCake Does he have sweet chops?
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-14 15:51:25	Now that @Dick_Hammer1 has left for E3...

2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-14 21:51:57	@tha_rami Not much right now. Unity is really the only engine that has VR (Rift) support, but UE4.something is about to have it as well.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-14 21:52:57	@tha_rami Plus, I think we'll see more VR games once there's actual profitable demand for them.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-15 18:02:24	@AckkStudios I like resounding applause that both people who cared about Madden gave for it.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-15 19:45:55	@theoldvulpine Seriously. All I saw were reasons why I don't and won't own an XBOXOne.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-15 19:54:53	@NecroDancerGame FIGURINE. I love figurines for some reason.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-15 20:07:23	@rfilkins1992 @NecroDancerGame Truth. Both.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-15 20:09:18	@GearboxSoftware needs to stop making incredible games like @battleborn so I can get things done.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-16 00:07:45	@Dick_Hammer1 Enjoy it. It's fucking gross and stupid here.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-16 17:39:51	@TipseeCake But hey! New Madden for the XBone!
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-16 00:00:02	@Dick_Hammer1 @UnholyTemptress Totally drinking one right now that you left.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-16 00:01:44	This is what you've been missing, @Dick_Hammer1: http://t.co/grbMQxKyFv
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-16 00:40:31	@TheSchwall Indeed it is. I'll take flooded roads over basements.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-16 02:13:55	@AckkStudios At the Microsoft conference, didn't you see?!
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-17 03:50:43	@booder1987 WHAT?! They make that too? What a great company. Sadly, no though.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-16 15:50:18	It's official. I enjoy Shake It Off.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-17 00:47:42	"Sure, I'll watch your baby. Can't say it won't develop impeccable tastes while you're gone though." http://t.co/bual0k5MvM
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-17 17:42:33	@Dick_Hammer1 OMFG I WANT THAT SHIRT
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-17 17:43:23	@Dick_Hammer1 I'M SO FUCKING JEALOUS
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-17 18:14:16	@tha_rami Why are people angry this time?
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-16 23:17:30	Today I made a low-poly destructible 3d model of a penis and helped an old lady get her keys out of her locked car. Today was a good day.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-17 20:22:00	@Dick_Hammer1 Also in Detroit, Madison, and Steven's Point.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-18 18:44:04	Also what @Dick_Hammer1 is missing: http://t.co/9EVh9PC5Yg
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-19 00:25:37	@TipseeCake With android you don't :D
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-19 00:28:23	@Dick_Hammer1 @Evryxx It doubles as a dog bed.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-19 04:25:20	@TipseeCake THERE'S CHICKEN IN THE FREEZER?! I am, however, going to be drinking your alcohol.
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-19 06:17:55	@Dick_Hammer1 My old room mate has this. And also the same shirt as me... #conspiracy #plsbuymethis http://t.co/7FElo3RrOn
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-20 01:02:44	@TipseeCake GIVE ME MY LUCK BACK
2995234655	Pasty_Swag	2015-06-20 03:14:12	@TipseeCake Good.
