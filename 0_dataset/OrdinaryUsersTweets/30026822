30026822	sarahhanderson	2013-04-29 21:31:33	@MariaFowler there's no recovery. The brain stem, which is damaged, controls stuff like breathing and consciousness.
30026822	sarahhanderson	2013-04-29 21:33:10	@MariaFowler so patients have to be ventilated, which is usually switched of after a short while.

30026822	sarahhanderson	2013-08-02 21:09:19	337.5 hours to go. Just the thought of those 45 shifts makes me want to commit #jesuswept
30026822	sarahhanderson	2013-08-05 19:37:13	Two things that grind my gears....
30026822	sarahhanderson	2013-08-05 19:37:36	ONE: people who don't know the difference between cardiac arrest and a heart attack.
30026822	sarahhanderson	2013-08-05 19:38:55	And TWO: people who don't understand steroids.. Just injecting them doesn't make people big you morons.
30026822	sarahhanderson	2013-08-08 11:44:15	@NandosUK why do these things happen in the cities I go to regularly, yet I'm never there!
30026822	sarahhanderson	2013-08-09 20:14:00	3 years in Liverpool, not a hint of the accent. Now with 7 weeks to go I seem to have turned into a scouser.

30026822	sarahhanderson	2013-08-17 16:17:22	@BLPHI what a cutie.
30026822	sarahhanderson	2013-08-14 19:08:16	@MariaFowler because the risks of anaesthesia and surgery in general shouldn't be taken lightly.
30026822	sarahhanderson	2013-08-14 19:36:51	@Ostler_ want a coaching session with Shiv Chanderpaul? 😎
30026822	sarahhanderson	2013-08-15 10:10:55	the Adorn remix with Jessie Ware offends me more and more everytime I hear it.

30026822	sarahhanderson	2015-05-06 13:54:57	@MrJulesKnight not really nonsense. There are a number of 'NHS' walk in centres/EDs run by virgin health under the NHS banner.
30026822	sarahhanderson	2015-05-06 13:55:44	@MrJulesKnight also a large number of NHS trusts use companies like Capita instead of their own HR departments
30026822	sarahhanderson	2015-05-06 14:07:05	@MrJulesKnight from hospital experience, it's no more effective. If not worse.
