300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 01:28:28	Man refused entry to club "not in that jumper" takes it off &amp; queues again. While waiting, man steals it, puts it on &amp; strolls into club

300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 02:21:23	@oJKo7 Know door staff have difficult job but sometimes the excuse/alternative reason given causes more problems!
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-09 18:26:15	Tonight we're supported by volunteers from @GMPSpecials @LGF_Angels @MCRStreetAngels Hugely grateful to them, especially with awful weather
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-09 18:34:17	Interesting Gorton Young Ambassadors video on theme of giving to charities rather than those begging @1mancunianway http://t.co/Z1mU4QXCpM

300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 19:25:07	@JordanLocky We're working really hard on this; this week alone have charged 10 men with 37 drugs offences Piccadilly Gardens
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 19:29:02	#OpMandera team have charged 10 men this week with 37 offences relating to drug dealing in Piccadilly Gardens. More in the pipeline...
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 19:32:01	@NeilProperMag Its not the one the Big Wheel broke though!
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 01:33:14	Insp S - OK, so I can't spell dessert! Customers had a fair point; paid full price but didn't realise only 10 mins to go. Money was refunded
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 01:34:01	Insp S - just finished lap of city on foot. Can't use the Q word, but put it this way, there's more taxis than people
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 01:38:29	@Brynchef Sorry - you need to read earlier Tweet about kicking off at the desert/dessert buffet
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 02:46:35	Insp S - that's me done. Insp R got the reins through till dawn. Goodnight
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 20:03:14	Insp S - just swooped on 2 suspected dealers Piccadilly Gardens - update to follow...
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 20:12:08	@HannahChristie Insp S - I would love 24/7 presence, but GMP going 8&gt;6,000 cops and tough resourcing decisions to make
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 20:16:20	Insp S - 2 men just arrested Piccadilly Gardens sus drug dealing following call to police. Drugs recovered.  #OpMandera
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 20:20:33	@JordanLocky We can't cover all the Gardens all the time; need support from public. Someone rang tonight and we now have 2 dealers locked up
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 20:22:54	@ProfoundryCo insp S - we're looking at that
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 22:07:13	Plainclothes officers have now swooped on man wanted for domestic violence matters who was spotted in Piccadilly Gardens.
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 22:12:28	@MrsKeane16 Insp S - It's a 24/7 hub and purpose built to meet &amp; hang out. No surprise then that people do!
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 22:41:40	Insp S - handed over the reins to Response/999 so heading out on foot in city centre - might need to swap helmet for sou'wester though
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 13:23:48	@NealkeelingMEN Insp S - just spoken to John S and I'll pull together the detail and send over today or tomorrow
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 13:26:16	@begumeyilmaz Action Fraud deal with both fraud &amp; cyber crime...give them a go http://t.co/CTzTBwsXdc
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 13:30:12	GMP + council taxi op in city last night. Vast majority stopped were OK but 9 suspended + 17 offences inc plying for hire &amp; thru red light
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 23:31:54	Insp S - incredible; Went to Dale St looking for one person and found someone else in canal who we've pulled out - lucky boy
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 23:53:00	Sweep Piccadilly Basin - 3 x alcohol confiscations. Now off to the Village
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-10 23:54:51	1st arrest - D&amp;D at Printworks which also became assault when spat in cops face :(
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 21:43:09	Insp S - just back from vigil/demo Piccadilly Gdns. Friction at end between opposing groups. Shortly after, 7 men got city bans for 12 hrs
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 21:59:36	@gerwyn it was advertised as solidarity for events in France, but others felt it was nationalistic, so turned up to oppose
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 22:17:18	@WeB4dGrammer No arrests were made. 7 men got 12 hr city bans as suspected they could be involved in disorder or crime
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 22:49:44	@MarieEgerton Insp S - We can ban up to 48 hrs, but have to be proportionate to risk; I deemed overnight ban to be appropriate
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 22:51:17	@Hercules_Fork  Insp S - I remember friend knocked back "no trainers" Came back with black socks over trainers and got in
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 14:46:54	@NickyLella Insp S - he was charged and goes to court in a couple of weeks
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 14:48:32	@gerwyn Insp S - that's a great summary of #OpConsiderate - I think I'll pinch that for future use!
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 14:51:08	Insp S - afternoon. 13 arrests last night so pretty hectic; mostly D&amp;D. Man who spat in cops face at Printworks has been charged
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 14:53:22	Insp S - man we pulled from canal Picc Basin was discharged 4am. Ambo said he'd only have hung on another min or so. And no, he wasnt pushed
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 14:55:03	@Rushton111 Insp S - must be one in Amsterdam too, where they reported 51 deaths in 3 years?
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 14:57:50	@MyloH303 Insp S - not naming venue...or even area...it's gets me in hot water!
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 14:58:54	@FartScissors We are aware of a vigil, but organisers insist it will be peaceful. We will be there to monitor
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 14:59:30	@gerwyn Some dates booked in for late Jan and Feb...watch this space!
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 15:00:51	@stuuee Insp S - he was very drunk; said he'd been drinking since 11am
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 15:12:19	@secret12345 @Danny_McMoomins @blsec Insp S - 1; Twitter less formal 2: ran out of space for 'ambulance'
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 16:09:40	@cannacol Insp S - or, glass half full, how much has it saved in terms of crime prevented + victims saved?
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 16:26:51	@SolitaNQ Independent article on some other obscure crimes... http://t.co/11CN4wk9xt
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-11 17:19:52	@cannacol Nothing to hide, but difficult to put time &amp; money cost on, ie take more than 18 hrs, so FOI request may be knocked back
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-12 19:27:37	Call earlier about suspicious males in building with torches, turns out to be a team building excersise. Did look sus to be fair to caller
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-12 20:52:51	@jacmanchester As mentioned previously by Insp S we have not got staff we once had, will try best to send some now though.@jacmanchester
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-12 20:55:40	1/2 DS Dave- I would encourage anyone offered drugs anywhere in the City to call 101 to report it. If we havent got a patrol available...
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-12 20:58:10	2/2 We can at least ask our partners in CCTV  to record them with a view to reviewing it at a later date.
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-12 21:00:02	@jacmanchester In a Eutopia that would happen, but alas we do the best we can with what we have. Thanks for heads up though.@jacmanchester
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-12 22:40:32	@jacmanchester Do you think it is only a problem for the police or should other partner's, agencies help too?? Just a thought@jacmanchester
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-12 22:45:28	@jacmanchester And what about all the licensed premises open all hours that attract criminals? have you thought of that? @jacmanchester
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 09:28:42	@gmpolice @biofemmy You can try but without seeing form its hard to say; we've recently been told not to sign passport photos for example
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 09:31:22	@fookitnow @gmpolice @ffokitnow Sorry if you've struggled in, but maybe @gmplongsight can help - it's not @gmpcitycentre. Or try 101?
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 09:36:37	Insp S - We understand &amp; share public concern about issues in Piccadilly Gardens. We're working so hard on dealing; 50+ dealers arrested 1/3
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 09:38:14	..in last 12 months + 9 ASBOs + 23 years prison. Still much to do but limited resources (GMP 8&gt;6,000 cops); of course 'more cops' helps..2/3
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 09:39:55	..+ 24/7 presence + Pod + better lights + CCTV + more intel from public (as well as -ve feedback) Please support/bear with us &amp; partners 3/3
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 10:33:25	@cannacol Insp S - Colin; et complaints everyday about PG, and minutes after publicising a good result, I then get "yeah, but..."
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 10:35:24	@ManchesterNorth Insp S - disagree. 10s of thousands pass thru every day &amp; enjoy PG without issue.
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 10:36:38	@KellDeggers Insp S - all interesting points; we know that those we put in prison are easily replaced
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 10:37:50	@ManchesterNorth OK got that. We know PG cannabis market has been built up over many years so no quick solutions I'm afraid
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 10:39:18	@Mancboy77Chris Insp S - even if I agreed, would be fairly meaningless; we simply can't deliver that here with budget cuts
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 10:40:32	@TrierInTheDisco Insp S - think the 'Wall' is here to stay but better lighting and CCTV would definitely help
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 10:46:30	Insp S - fancy getting off keyboard and seeing how we police Piccdilly Gdns + rest of city? Community reporter info:  http://t.co/d7aB7Ghl1T
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 10:49:50	@jacquicotter Insp S; mainland Euro approach to alcohol very different but sure Paris will have its own PG with similar issues
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 10:51:02	@GMPCityCentre Insp S - I don't have all the answers + always reflect on meaningful criticism. Thanks for the offer though!
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 10:54:15	Help us solve this city centre robbery. Recognise this man with piercing blue eyes, or possibly blue contact lenses? http://t.co/aVZkrxPlMM
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 10:58:32	@gmpolice @fookitnow Just seen this in MEN which explains the delays http://t.co/Dt2C4p6Xl2
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 11:03:22	@jacquicotter I think cannabis use high in France + strict laws @cannacol would know http://t.co/hT0f6zZQzl
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 11:14:24	@cannacol Insp S - Colin; simply wondered if you had a view on France &amp; cannabis as @jacquicotter raised it in our PG discussion
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 11:15:21	@KellDeggers Insp S who said you were #paranoid ;) Thought your points were interesting + balanced
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-12 16:13:08	DS Dave- Evenin All, hope you are all well and had a good weekend, with you on late shifts till Wednesday will keep you posted on incidents.
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 12:55:35	@KellDeggers Insp S - you don't wear high vis. You tag along in own clothes + blend into background if it kicks off
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 14:51:31	Cat - afternoon all, myself and DS Dave with you until late. Updates to follow...

300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-01-13 18:50:49	@Limpopobongo Best to ring 101 and pass details just in case they don't pick up on Twitter

300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 07:22:20	A very good Sunday morning to you. Nothing major to report today from overnight, though another minor assault on an officer reported (1/2)
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 07:25:39	During domestic in street BFdrags GF to floor. Police attend, arrest BF who kicks off &amp; then GF assaults officer who came to help her (2/2)
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 07:52:17	@oafaaftooth Both were arrested at scene and will be interviewed this morning
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 07:54:17	@tignmb Sadly it is a common occurrence especially at highly emotional incidents like domestics.
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 07:55:28	@tignmb Very similar to when people attack medical staff who are trying to treat them
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 08:04:31	Bizarre article in The Independent that Cambridgeshire police had report of 2 yr old shoplifter. Bit young to start.. http://t.co/oQKkjR0shS
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 08:14:44	@oafaaftooth BF was immediately arrested based on evidence available. We don't generally turn up &amp; arrest the apparent victim
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 09:40:02	@oafaaftooth I understand. We have to strike balance. Reputation for arresting abuse victims would prevent others coming forward. Can't risk
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 10:16:28	The city is starting to wake up &amp; the interesting jobs (sub) roll in. Drunk man asleep at table in a food outlet, staff couldn't rouse him
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-21 09:09:05	Staff on last night suggest fairly Q in city; just 4 arrests. However, 1 man arrested D&amp;D decided to bite PCs leg for some bizarre reason :(
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-21 09:46:49	Morning Manchester, Steve here after a bit of a holiday. How are we all doing?
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-21 10:02:12	@manutdifan Likely to breach licence - condition around harm. If city venue pls email me phil.spurgeon@gmp.police.uk
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 12:14:59	@MufcExecAndVIP We can assure you that no assumptions were made it was based on visual evidence
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 12:16:37	Vigilant hotel staff spotted man hiding a bag in city. Check by officers reveals likely homeless persons belongings #AlwaysWorthChecking
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 12:21:34	@AmyMartin1510 Hi Amy. They were for a training exercise that we do with fire service to replicate a real life scenario #Interoperability
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 12:24:27	@amymartin1510 this is a pic from @ACCIanWiggett who tweeted that night http://t.co/DO97Ah4OgE
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 12:25:07	@AmyMartin1510 Tweeted you a pic. Check @accianwiggett for more
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 12:27:36	@AmyMartin1510 I was taking part in this fantastic but exhausting scenario for @gmpolice with @gmfrstraining and @manchesterfire
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 12:35:07	Just heard over radio that @nwambulance colleagues were met with aggression when trying to assist someone who had fallen in canal
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 12:40:28	@c_jamesm20 Judging by the exact location etc they were most likely placed for safekeeping to return for later
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 12:47:14	@jonathan240869 My understanding is that they were already out &amp; a concerned passer by had called @nwambulance for their assistance
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 12:57:49	@c_jamesm20 There was a fair bit of food and drink in the bag already, sleeping bag and warm clothing
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 13:07:40	@ManCityCouncil @AntLeach This is certainly something for the council licensing team to be aware of. We will raise it with them
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 13:09:34	@SolihullPolice @PCDKirkwood @NewportCops @ConstableChaos Thanks for your support &amp; endorsement Constable

300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 13:16:37	@1simongreenwood We do significant amounts of work with partner agencies to try reduce begging &amp; homeless issues ...
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 13:17:48	@1simongreenwood It is a social problem which cannot be solved by criminal justice system alone
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 13:21:52	@ManCityCouncil @mcrPhil I often wonder about this myself. I will speak to council delivery team &amp; see what their stance is
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 13:33:04	@ManCityCouncil @mcrPhil Good idea. We do regular walkarounds with council so can identify sights and eyesores etc
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 14:21:39	@McrBiker @ManCityCouncil It falls under @GMPLongsight however enforcement would be by City Council Licensing &amp; parking wardens
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 14:35:19	@c_jamesm20 We work with No Second Night Out closely to help find shelter. Sadly many homeless refuse agency assistance
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-21 17:06:10	Cat - afternoon all. I'm with you until late on this bright, sunny day in the city. All PCSOs currently out on foot patrol around the city.

300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-20 17:00:57	DS Dave- Good Evening Manchester, all Q on Western Front at the moment, hope you all have a safe weekend and enjoyed the eclipse earlier.
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-20 17:56:13	@GMPCityCentre No regarding training as detectives as you have to become accredited through a university now. Happy for them to help though
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-20 17:57:29	Vulnerability patrols about to start working in the City till 2am, looking to help our most vulnerable people at risk of CSE.
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-22 20:14:36	@c_jamesm20 Some not wanting to stick to no drink/no drugs rules. Others struggle to adapt to structured living
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-23 19:10:34	Insp S - see Big Wheel is going soon. Wonder what our drunks, urban explorers &amp; other 'stranger folk' will climb now? http://t.co/v25skhCgwm

300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-23 08:02:40	@mcfcnorthstand2 Ouch! Good job it wasn't the beer I guess?
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-23 08:05:31	@samuelmworthy Must admit it was nice to be out on patrol in the nicer weather
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-23 08:06:37	@mcfcnorthstand2 Now that is just not on!
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-23 08:10:45	@mcfcnorthstand2 However sticking with positive theme, think of the collective cholesterol avoidance that day &amp; money saved
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-23 08:11:53	@stusingy @gazboost @EnglandRugby Shame about the Championship but alas we have our sights on bigger things #RWC2015

300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-23 08:29:25	Some persistent work with @ManCityCouncil &amp; building owners to clear up &amp; secure this problem area has paid of http://t.co/sNPlOSC5ET
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-23 08:32:32	@DavidJClifford Well that's still quite intimate
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-23 08:41:51	@alivally I'm sure the blue side of the city will have some views on that. Either way it can only be good for Manchester as a whole
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-23 09:00:04	@jacquicotter Morning Jacqui. No that's not our DS Dave &amp; Insp S is still alive n kicking dipping his toe in now &amp; again over weekend. Steve

300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-23 12:42:38	@DazzlinDaveo @Alberthallmcr Looks a bit rough round edges in places; who looks for aesthetic perfection in gig venues anyway?
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-23 12:43:56	@Mrs_Heather_K Many happy returns Heather, what a lucky daughter too. Off out anywhere?
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-23 12:48:20	@Mrs_Heather_K Best stay indoors then to reduce the risk of being bad and be careful what you tweet?

300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-27 21:24:45	@PRIMEMINTMIND Sorry to hear this, the first step would be to report it to your local council who have a specialist team for noise nuisance

300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-27 21:38:22	@PRIMEMINTMIND Depending on the nature of the nuisance Police involvement can be quite tricky.
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-27 21:39:15	@mylokaye Absolutely, I have to practice what I preach
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-27 21:43:40	@4c853d3ac721459 Which area? I will refer your comments to them for attention. Steve

300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 12:20:01	@itsreight Insp S; on reflection, didn't want people to think I was trivialising...have re-phrased + resent
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 22:04:20	It's a rather wet one in city tonight but judging by how many people are wearing shorts it has come as a surprise to some #AlwaysRaining
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 22:08:31	@ChimpInATopHat You didn't have to go to work in shorts did you? Can't imagine my boss being too happy if I turned up in my finest Bermudas
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 22:09:45	@ChimpInATopHat Secondly I think she might be trying to tell you to do your own washing in future
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 22:39:26	Has anybody had a #SuperSaturday or a #SillySaturday where things have gone great or inexcusably wrong? I stood on an upturned plug!
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 22:45:21	@Jojo1969Joanne Tell me about it. Someone drove through a big puddle &amp; splashed me on the way into work - not the best start
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 22:46:52	@kimcarmyllie Oh wow a choccy festival. I hope @GMPRamsbottom got us some samples to send in the internal post!
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 22:48:25	@careee It was barefoot, my eyes watered and I turned the air in my home blue.
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 22:50:01	@johnnimmo00 It's not something I'd recommend at all #SillySaturday
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 22:51:39	@QueenAJ Congrats to your team @GlossopNorthEnd (although I always thought that team was from Preston?)
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 22:57:02	@kimcarmyllie I'd be having a lovely day too protecting (sampling) the lovely choccy delights!
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 22:58:44	@johnnimmo00 It didn't reply correctly in the thread of the conversation with the app we use so was a bit pointless.
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 22:59:58	@johnnimmo00 But yes it was most definitely an electrical plug attached to my iron
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 23:14:23	@DaveyGD34 It could be argued as an assault if a malicious act. Not on a police officer though as I wasn't identifiable at the time
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 23:18:51	@johnnimmo00 We like to keep a bit of light heartedness when we can
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 23:20:46	@Vafuncullo Ouch! That's definitely not advisable. Maybe the spirit of a previously entrapped mouse was exacting some otherworldly revenge?
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-28 23:52:32	Vulnerable people patrols tonight have found a drunk 14 year old boy from Bury &amp; missing 15 year old girl from Benchill - both taken home

300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-29 11:01:07	@steevedh GMPCityCentre Insp S; you asked the same questions 3 weeks ago and the answers are still the same!

300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-29 11:55:06	@MostonRedDevil Staff did notice and gave chase, but she eluded them
300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-29 11:55:51	@Luciee92 GMPCityCentre Insp S - read the small print and it tells you about appeal rpocess

300304187	GMPCityCentre	2015-03-29 14:39:02	@steevedh GMPCityCentre Insp; if not, it was because your question was rhetorical &amp; repetitive! The answer is still 'you, me, everybody' :)
