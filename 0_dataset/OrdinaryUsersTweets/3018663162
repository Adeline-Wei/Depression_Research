3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-13 19:04:40	When you're just going about your day and you realize it's Friday the 13th and now you just want to go home and crawl back into bed...
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-14 07:45:36	I sort of want to sleep, but then again, Netflix.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-14 01:42:06	@Bridge_Byerlee @jamie_byerlee Bridget... Did someone swoop in and steal your heart?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-15 00:15:18	@henniferrrr God that would have been a boring period without you guys
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-14 22:59:47	Hey, anyone else notice we appear to be living in the future? #nanotechnology #future http://t.co/dK8Du4ucyC
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-14 22:55:43	Spending Valentine's Day binging on Hulu/Netflix, because I love @BackstromFOX more than any actual person. #i'msolonely
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-15 18:54:13	President's Day is great, because it's basically just a celebration of presidents who weren't really important enough to have their own day
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-15 04:43:30	As Mock Trial is over, I have all the time in the world. Like, what can I even do with myself? I could get a job. I could write a book.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-15 04:47:40	@Bridge_Byerlee Bridget, you live a very exciting life.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-16 05:41:09	Have you guys ever noticed how one second your fine, and then the next you're in some intense, unprovoked emotional state? #F***hormones
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-16 05:49:47	@portillo_mida I was my own Valentine. I'm kind of in love with myself.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-16 06:32:27	@mikaylasmithson Mikayla, don't worry. You have a lot to be happy about.(I had to re-do this, because I made errors, and I'm a Grammar Nazi)

3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-20 03:24:45	@kiaaaarrraaa Be a liberal arts major and never have to do math again.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-20 04:25:26	@mikaylasmithson If they don't say otherwise, an essay is double space.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-20 05:12:11	@Bridge_Byerlee Next stop Netflix Central, and Oh-My-God-It's-5:00-AM City
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-20 17:52:18	@mikaylasmithson That's remarkably optimistic.

3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-22 02:07:43	@Bridge_Byerlee That might be their intended effect.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-22 02:08:06	@okmxlissa Books have the best damn smell.

3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-02-22 04:42:22	Sometimes I wish I had a wise, sassy, old person to dispense wisdom that directly related to whatever problem I currently have.

3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-24 19:03:25	Ms. : women in general/ Mrs. : a married woman / Miss : An unmarried woman / Mr. : men in general #EnglishHonorifics
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-24 19:12:47	Ms. (miz) refers to any woman regardless of marital status. Miss refers to an unmarried woman.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-24 14:50:18	@Jacopo_della_Q "I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight, and that the Sisters let him be. But prison ain't no fairytale."
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-24 16:15:54	Pretty girls complicate my life so much...
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-24 18:21:46	@LiamMirise: My grades are like Greece's economy: They've been drastically declining over the last decade.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-26 00:29:57	University of Portland mailed me a poster, and I gotta say I kinda like it. http://t.co/Q6tAsNmXKw
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-26 02:47:53	@brianbonner Fiat money isn't worthless. It has worth because we all say it does, the same as precious metals. Value is based off perception
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-26 02:54:23	@brianbonner Commodity currency just isn't feasible for the globalized economy. And we're about as far from serfs as possible.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-26 03:13:18	@brianbonner You should realize that Keynesian Economics is over half a century old. The world and the economy changes.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-27 04:45:58	@VanessaMeneces Vanessa, planning your essays is like the most important thing ever. I ALWAYS plan. (He said sarcastically)
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-27 04:47:05	@AnnabelleYvette The sad thing is that the ten year old probably has more relationship experience than I do...
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-27 04:53:14	@VanessaMeneces Wow, you're still up Vanessa? Are you on crack now or something?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-27 23:59:23	@VanessaMeneces When is it not your nap time?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-27 04:47:54	@Bridge_Byerlee When does Bridget not have a fun day? Don't you live in like, a world of perpetual sunshine and rainbows?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-27 04:49:22	@liyaahh__ Books are important Aaliyah, they often convey meaningful insights to life and the human experience. A peek into another place.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-27 04:51:00	@liyaahh__ I'm just dispensin' the cold hard truth. If what I'm preachin' be to powerful, that's your problem homes.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-27 04:54:45	@VanessaMeneces I honestly wouldn't be that surprised.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-27 04:56:44	My sleep schedule is so royally fucked.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-27 04:59:31	Yo, @portillo_mida , happy birthday.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-27 07:12:03	@Downs_1998 I feel you Martimus.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-28 02:45:10	It is too damn hot.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-28 02:58:10	@VanessaMeneces Do hiccups like, run in your family or something?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-28 19:40:58	@VanessaMeneces Same.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-28 19:55:10	Anyone want to hangout tonight?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-29 05:33:39	@snavarro1224 Why thank you , Sam.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-29 05:35:46	When someone doesn't text you back after a risky text and you're like http://t.co/JIzZgq6ez8
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-28 22:57:36	@danii_ariel Have you read "Catcher In The Rye"?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-28 23:09:41	@danii_ariel It's good, but the main character is a total asshole. You have to sort of ignore him to enjoy it.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-29 01:07:05	@Bridge_Byerlee I haven't stopped laughing for the past five minutes.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-29 01:07:44	@AnnabelleYvette I don't see how that'd be possible, as I don't own a skateboard.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-29 01:07:58	@VanessaMeneces When are you not?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-30 08:45:08	@VanessaMeneces I'z be up lass.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-29 08:40:18	@Bridge_Byerlee Woah, isn't it past your bedtime Bridget?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-29 22:04:49	Finished #Californication , now on to #Weeds . #netflixbinge
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-30 02:29:46	Hey, ya'll DM me if you want to hang out this week.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-30 20:16:06	@VanessaMeneces Wait, are you moving to Clovis?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-30 21:02:55	I think we all have one friend who can best be described as a heterosexual life partner.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-31 16:38:50	@VanessaMeneces You felt correctly!
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-31 00:59:05	@kiaaaarrraaa We never hang out Kiara. We should do something this week.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-31 01:52:51	@jamie_byerlee It's only a selfie if you took it. Otherwise it's just a picture.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-31 05:48:34	@portillo_mida @Bridge_Byerlee You guys are like, heterosexual life partners.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-31 05:55:15	@portillo_mida Wouldn't you be El Salvadorian? As in El Salvador?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-01 01:19:38	@NatGilbreath Great show right?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-01 20:23:53	@okmxlissa I need to be mentally impaired for anything remotely interesting to come out.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-31 06:36:06	@portillo_mida @Bridge_Byerlee Twitter suits me. If I'm allowed to ramble, I become much less amusing.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-31 07:34:56	@Bridge_Byerlee Well my Heavens, Miss Bridget Kathleen Byerlee, up at this ungodly hour?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-03-31 09:09:34	Tall, blonde, and handsome- That's me.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-01 05:26:51	@NatGilbreath Less than when they don't respond.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-01 05:27:39	@okmxlissa I thank God for the gift of having a Y chromosome.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-01 05:29:55	@Bridge_Byerlee Bridge, you have more friend than I do, and that's saying something. You should have no problem making plans.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-01 05:30:55	@okmxlissa I wake up randomly at 3 AM sometimes and write.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-01 05:32:54	@mikaylasmithson Aviators are my thing Mikayla.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-01 05:33:44	I feel like I'd be a really terrifying dictator.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 03:08:00	@Downs_1998 I feel like that compliment was directed at me, even if it was sent to your Ask.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 03:13:19	@wtfidekuhhhh @liyaahh__  A statute of limitations or the Statue of Liberty...? Only one of those things is only in New York.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 03:15:21	@liyaahh__ @wtfidekuhhhh The wonderful thing about me is that I pretty much don't give a shit.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 03:16:20	@wtfidekuhhhh @liyaahh__ She'll see it when she unblocks me. She'll come back. They always come back.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 03:16:50	@AnnabelleYvette This place is like hell, but with way more cows.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 03:20:14	@AnnabelleYvette I didn't text you, because I seem to not have your number. Must be a mistake, no?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 03:20:40	@Mdre_dre Well, it is April Fools.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 03:21:54	@Mdre_dre Just stating the plainly obvious. It's what I live for.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-01 05:38:59	@mikaylasmithson Ah, but I look much better in them.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-01 06:46:42	To sleep or to Netflix, that is the question.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-01 06:49:39	@IsabelIion Good luck. She can't even figure out how texting works.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-01 06:51:46	@IsabelIion Old people have lives too Isabel.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-01 06:55:41	@IsabelIion I know. And then they can all go down to the sock hop, and drink some sodie pop before headin' back to the farm on their horses.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 05:09:52	@portillo_mida I'd take you up on the offer, but it's dark, I'm white, and my only mode of transportation is my bike.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 05:12:18	I feel like my relationships with most people revolve around me cracking jokes/being a smart ass and hoping they put up with my shit.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 05:15:52	@portillo_mida I've seen horror movies, and "Taken". The city at night is no place for white folk to be traipsing about.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 05:16:58	@portillo_mida I'm way to pretty to get sold into sexual slavery.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 05:20:50	@portillo_mida Goddamit, you're correct. Mein English ist schleckt. –ú–æ–∏ –ê–Ω–≥–ª–∏–∏ –ø–ª–æ—Ö–∞.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-01 22:12:51	@liyaahh__ I can literally feel the sun slowly burning me when I'm outside. #whitepeopleproblems
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 19:12:02	@GOPTeens Chiller than a whole bunch of old, white, Super- Conservatives. #StopPandering #HillaryClinton #ThisIsBullshit #LetsBeHonest
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 06:18:45	@AlyssaHerrera16 She probably thinks the guy who owns the profile is cute, and is attempting to woo him.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 06:23:18	@NatGilbreath Why Natalie, how sweet of you to think of me.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 06:25:50	I think about half of my conversations with women are attempts at flirting.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 07:23:29	@NatGilbreath Omg if you have not seen Back to The Future, you've gotta see that shit man.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 07:26:06	@portillo_mida I had to have, like most of my first teeth torn out by a fucking dentist. I feel thine pain child.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 07:37:27	@portillo_mida Your face feels like it's made out of cotton, or rubber right?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 07:39:00	@portillo_mida Mhm. It really sucks.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 07:46:28	So much work to do, so little desire to do it...
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 07:48:42	@danii_ariel Hey, never forget, you have several million variety of microflora living inside you right now. You're their entire world.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 07:59:46	"Goodnight sweet prince, and may flights of angels sing thee unto thy rest."
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 18:43:58	I'm actually getting things done today. I feel very accomplished, like I'm getting my life back on track today.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 02:01:30	You' e truly run out of things to do when you start using Chat-roulette.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 22:48:57	I'm ready for break to end. I hate to say it, but I miss all you bastards.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 22:51:42	Anyone want to hang out? @mikaylasmithson @owenjwwebb @joleary97 @ecobian05
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 22:54:35	Seriously, I'll even take @Bridge_Byerlee at this point.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 22:55:47	@Bridge_Byerlee I'm mean to everyone, people just overlook it because I'm interesting.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-04 00:00:40	@kiaaaarrraaa Woah, cool your jets.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 04:08:46	@VanessaMeneces @SexualGif I crossed the street without using the crosswalk one. Does that make me a bad boy? üòé
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 04:09:18	@kiaaaarrraaa I don't know, wtf ARE you doing?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 04:15:40	@AlyssaHerrera16 @VanessaMeneces @SexualGif It's dangerous. And illegal. Like drug trafficking. Hence, Jaywalkers=Drug traffickers.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 04:17:35	@VanessaMeneces @AlyssaHerrera16 @SexualGif Lol, Vanessa, since when?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 04:19:56	@AlyssaHerrera16 @VanessaMeneces It's "jaywalking", not "j-walking".
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 04:21:10	@VanessaMeneces Oh, that makes more sense. Sadly, none of the guys you know are going to be men anytime soon. We mature slowly, like cheese.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 04:22:46	@AlyssaHerrera16 @VanessaMeneces No, the word is "jaywalking".
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-04 04:35:50	@AnnabelleYvette Annabelle... Did you... Did you pimp out your mother for ice cream?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-04 04:36:54	Just finished the last season of #Weeds , and I'm emotionally damaged.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-04 05:01:16	Finished #Weeds , now on to #Jericho . The Netflixathon continues.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-04 05:02:55	@Bridge_Byerlee @danceforever195 I miss you people for some reason. It's kind of irritating.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-04 05:03:23	@snavarro1224 I would, if you would add me.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-04 05:07:05	@AnnabelleYvette Joking, Annabelle.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 04:26:14	@AlyssaHerrera16 @VanessaMeneces Pictures like that are what win arguments.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 04:28:15	@VanessaMeneces @AlyssaHerrera16 As hilarious as I find the J Walking picture, Google hath spoken: http://t.co/3vRjtdBNtz
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 04:29:30	@VanessaMeneces Alright, God, chill. Thought you were involved.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 04:31:43	@AlyssaHerrera16 Ok, we're cool then?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 04:32:12	@AlyssaHerrera16 Cool.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-04 05:36:21	@portillo_mida Are you addressing someone called "cries", or are you saying you cry. Actions go in between asterisks *chuckles sinisterly*
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-04 05:37:20	Maps are sexy. http://t.co/Dl3rhgf1U2
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-04 02:22:08	@NatGilbreath Good God why?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-04 02:23:11	@portillo_mida White chocolate?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 07:39:47	@kiaaaarrraaa Kiara, please stop sub tweeting. It confuses me so much, and I'm already confused about too many things.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 07:43:55	@kiaaaarrraaa Hey, I don't judge. Hookers and blow, sounds like a good weekend to me.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 07:45:33	Okay, going to sleep now. Gotta wake up in the morning, feel guilty for not going to church, hide eggs, and do all the homework. #FML
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 08:00:17	@Mdre_dre @kiaaaarrraaa What'd you expect? I'm an amoral hedonist.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 08:03:58	@Mdre_dre @kiaaaarrraaa Shhhh Andrea. I'm going to sleep. And private conversations should occur outside of the public forum. DMs, Texts,etc
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 08:05:36	@Mdre_dre @kiaaaarrraaa Hell, send a letter. God knows the USPS needs the business. Talk to people face to face. Confront thine problems.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 08:07:41	@Mdre_dre @kiaaaarrraaa Damn right it is. Ya'll crazy chillun stay up too late for me.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-04 06:36:44	@ecobian05 It's ok.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-04 07:25:49	@VanessaMeneces Count sheep. Read. Take an Ambien. Don't sleep. All of these are valid options.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 20:30:58	It's smoothie time, mothafuckas! http://t.co/jGsgi1akZr
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 20:36:58	@VanessaMeneces Au contrer mademoiselle, it is work in progress. http://t.co/cIHHgjSHkE
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 20:16:34	Happy Get-Out-Of-Hell-Free Card Day everyone! #Easter2015
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 20:17:37	@kiaaaarrraaa Lol, Easter for me consists f my three relatives coming over to watch my little sister gather eggs.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-05 20:19:13	@mikaylasmithson Well, either Christ or the long rooted tradition of celebrating the coming of spring and the planting season.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-04 20:40:36	@Bridge_Byerlee Future generations: What's a smile? What's an emoji? What's a text? What's Twitter?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-04 20:41:38	@wtfidekuhhhh Sounds like a blast.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-06 03:38:58	@VanessaMeneces Is Taco Guy the next Christian Henry?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-06 03:40:45	@VanessaMeneces Go for it Vanessa. Get the Taco.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-06 03:42:41	@VanessaMeneces Lol, okay. Live in the moment Vanessa. Eyes on the prize.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-06 03:45:05	@VanessaMeneces Gotta be easy, breezy, beautiful, Covergirl mon Cher.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-06 06:01:42	@VanessaMeneces This isn't late...

3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 23:47:07	@AnnabelleYvette I have so much to do, so I'm ignoring it and hoping it will go away.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 23:52:24	@AnnabelleYvette If only
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-02 23:54:16	@kiaaaarrraaa If my mission was to accomplish nothing, and I haven't accomplished anything, have I accomplished something?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 00:22:49	@kiaaaarrraaa But nothing is the absence of something.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 00:24:07	@kiaaaarrraaa Saying "exactly" just makes this so much more complicated somehow.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 00:33:39	@AlyssaHerrera16 She ruins my mood sometimes.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 00:50:17	I really hate people, and it pisses me off that I need them so much.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 01:06:26	Keshin is one of my favorite people.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 01:08:53	@AlyssaHerrera16 She can be a real buzzkill.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 04:46:17	@danceforever195 Why the hell would you want to?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 06:10:12	@danceforever195 I'm... I'm just very disappointed.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 06:11:09	I'm an idiot.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 06:13:48	@portillo_mida Solar plex, instep, nose, groin!
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 06:15:24	@Bridge_Byerlee Bridge, hon, what's up with the avi. Your hair... Just...
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 06:15:53	@kiaaaarrraaa I ain't got nuttin' ta say ta you.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 06:16:11	I think I have the soul of a sassy black woman.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 06:19:21	@AlyssaHerrera16 @Bridge_Byerlee Alright. Far be it from me to critic fashion. God knows I'm hopeless in that department.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 06:20:09	@portillo_mida It's a reference to a chick flick from the 80's. Don't worry about it.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 06:28:13	90% sure I'm going to Hell.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 06:34:17	@danceforever195 Mashaal. It's the seventh sequel to an already fairly mediocre movie. I'm a movie snob. But, if it makes you happy, ok.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 06:59:24	@henniferrrr Most of my sister's friends have little crushes on me, so I generally avoid her parties.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 07:00:31	@portillo_mida Ew, like even black licorice? Black/Purple jelly beans?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-03 07:15:42	@LiamMirise: I have some very serious personality flaws, and I think I'm going to overlook them because fixing them sounds hard.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-08 17:34:22	Math makes me sad.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-06 20:30:57	@VanessaMeneces Did you ever start studying for your AP tests? üòÇüòÇ
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-07 06:46:08	@danceforever195 @jamie_byerlee Holy crap, my AP Euro Packet.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-07 07:23:28	@danceforever195 @jamie_byerlee A week's work done in an hour. I'm damn good.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-07 15:11:24	Walking into 1st period and realizing you forgot your AP Euro Poster at home...üò•
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-07 17:39:45	I think I forgot how to talk to people over break.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-09 02:34:10	@VanessaMeneces Good luck!
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-10 05:10:42	@Bridge_Byerlee Probably the funniest thing I've seen all day. Byerlees= Two of my favorite people üòÇüòÇüòÇ
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-09 05:55:05	Watching "To Catch A Predator", and the look on those pervs faces when Chris Hanson walks out is so satisfying. #Dateline #ChrisHanson
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-09 05:59:49	It's kind of hilarious and cathartic to see #ChrisHansen make pedophile feel smaller than the children they try to diddle #tocatchapredator
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-11 06:14:24	@Bridge_Byerlee Bridge, stop your vendetta against kendamas. It's unhealthy.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-11 22:48:31	Luau with these lovely ladies @mikaylasmithson @andersen_sydney http://t.co/JSOMOjN80h

3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-13 02:05:08	@aannarenee_ Lol, you and Greg are dating, what?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-13 02:05:41	@VanessaMeneces You're cute?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-13 02:06:17	@VanessaMeneces Yes? Right?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-13 02:07:21	@VanessaMeneces Like, probably?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-13 02:08:38	@aannarenee_ I'm basically the last one to pick up on anything, every time.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-13 02:53:56	8'o'clock and it's just getting dark... I really hate summer.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-13 03:49:53	Just saying, the world would be a better place today if we still had #FredRogers
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-13 03:55:56	@joleary97 Just read the books. Then you can skip all the episodes, and wait at the end of the line for George to release the next f'ing one
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-13 04:00:05	@joleary97 Books aren't movies. Language has a beauty separate from the glorified image.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-13 04:02:04	@joleary97 I think I exist in a time warp where I only have time when it comes to media and entertainment.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-13 06:10:05	It's always fun when you get a stomach flu during the weekend. üò•üò•üò•
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-12 04:37:24	PG-13 movies show violence without consequences (blood, gore, etc.), and R films show it with those. Guess which one we show to kids?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-12 06:02:26	If you can't handle people being mean to you, don't use the Internet. It's where assholes go to socialize and spawn.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-14 04:02:16	I feel like so much crap right now.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-15 14:35:12	@realmckayla Do it. YOLO. Live adventurously.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-15 16:08:03	@Bridge_Byerlee Found this in Ibbs class. Thought you might appreciate it. http://t.co/oaukbfUVtp
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-14 23:07:47	Why does my math textbook seem to be written in Ancient Sumerian?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-15 00:00:16	@AlyssaHerrera16 Puns are the highest form of humor. Ever read Shakespeare? It's like Punmaggedon.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-15 00:14:39	The US is basically that girl who loves to publicly bitch about her problems. Other countries have issues they just don't talk about them.

3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-16 02:47:40	@VanessaMeneces Ever heard of BlahTherapy? It's a website where you can vent anonymously to strangers for free.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-16 05:27:38	There's too much fucking media and entertainment out there, and I will go mad trying to shift through it all. Thus is my life.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-16 05:30:13	@joleary97 @theatregeek729 Aha! Found something I better at than Jack. Life is complete.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-16 05:33:08	It's our purpose to witness in awe the pure, unbridled, balls out insanity of the universe.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-15 04:43:47	So, I'll be back in school tomorrow. See ya'll bitches on the inside.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-16 06:20:05	@jamie_byerlee Next on #Dateline with #ChrisHansen ?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-16 06:22:38	I am never more spiritual than right after a scary movie.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-17 00:27:37	Ever have one those days where all your human interactions seem lackluster and awkward?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-17 05:01:36	I seriously just can't do anything right sometimes.

3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-17 14:04:26	Really just want to avoid people today.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-17 17:09:15	All diplomatic issues with Russia should be solved through mortal combat between Arnold "the Governator" Schwarzenegger and Pres. Putin.

3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-19 06:43:37	Just saw the series finale of Wilfred, and I have never been more confused. Like, WTF! What was behind the basement door!?!?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-19 18:56:33	Happy birthday @danii_ariel !

3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-20 14:01:35	@Bridge_Byerlee "American Beauty"?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-21 04:07:02	@VanessaMeneces Vanessa, you're about as far from a stoner as humanly possible.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-21 04:14:51	@VanessaMeneces Like, the Pope has probably been high more than you have.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-22 02:17:55	Watching #TheBabadook
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-22 07:01:25	@VanessaMeneces Kennedy. Always Kennedy.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-22 16:13:45	Kinda hoping a nuclear war starts before the end of semester, 'cause my grades suck.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-23 20:07:42	Like, this situation where I don't have a girlfriend is getting irritating.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-24 02:11:03	One year of water left before California becomes a Dust Bowl. We're all fucked :/
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-24 02:22:58	Hey, if the Californian economy collapses, can we put that on our college apps?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-24 18:33:45	Why I Have A C In Math: Distracted by all the beautiful girls in the class.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-24 14:05:22	Ultimately, it continues.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-25 16:59:40	@VanessaMeneces Should I favorite the post to show sympathy, or is that like me saying I'm glad you have a cough? #descisions
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-28 06:36:27	Taking life seriously kinda misses the point. It's much too hilarious and random to not be some sort of cosmic joke.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-28 06:37:59	I find it hilarious when high school couples take their relationships so seriously.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-27 14:23:29	Soooooo tired...
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-27 04:56:33	@VanessaMeneces No, what's crazier is that 5-9 years from now you'll actually be a person, with a life, and it'll be like that for the rest.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-27 04:57:42	@Payan_64 @Serina_Sanchez I blame high-speed internet.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-27 05:04:14	@VanessaMeneces Death and taxes await at the end of the line wherever it is you go.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-27 05:06:03	@VanessaMeneces Vanessa, if you found the key to immortality or successful tax evasion, you better share that crap right now. For reals.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-27 05:13:25	@Mdre_dre @VanessaMeneces I jus' be layin' down the ultimately nihilistic nature of existence, man.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-04-27 05:15:50	@Mdre_dre @VanessaMeneces Cool, cool. I'm gonna go to sleep. Later ya'll.

3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-05 04:58:53	Watching #AdventureTime on Netflix because I'm just that cool.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-06 21:35:46	I want a girlfriend, but I'm also sort of a self-centered dick and I'm not particularly attractive, so it's probably not going to happen.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-08 23:51:25	@IsabelIion Goddammit. I have to commit seppuku now. I've dishonored myself as a grammar now. Gotta fall on my own grammatical blade.

3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-30 04:50:38	My bed is the love of my life.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-29 18:21:10	@sexualgifs_ @Mdre_dre That's a retelling of a short story. Who'd have thought Disney would rip off earlier works?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-30 04:47:21	New found respect for waiters.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-30 16:23:10	On the way to the first tournament of the summer polo season.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-30 20:36:45	@joleary97 @Bridge_Byerlee I can attest as to the veracity of this statement.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-31 05:54:56	@VanessaMeneces Ha, Vanessa, a comedian. That's actually a pretty good joke.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-31 05:55:52	@realmckayla What, did your sister have LSD or something on her tongue?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-31 06:02:59	@VanessaMeneces @RuthyMcDo @ManCanddyPics Like, who is this person? http://t.co/akSqGBgWFn
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-31 06:04:06	@VanessaMeneces Ummm, I think you're mistaken. He totally looks like me.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-31 06:05:40	@realmckayla You and Vanessa are both being very difficult tonight. Her running off to join the circus, and you getting high on LSD.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-29 22:24:21	Good luck in your concert tonight! @Bridge_Byerlee @michaelmc_14 @owenjwwebb
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-30 22:52:32	@liyaahh__ "though"
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-05-30 23:01:35	@wtfidekuhhhh @liyaahh__ Not at our school?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-01 20:30:36	Really feeling the Stones "Let It Bleed" Album today.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-01 23:58:08	If things every seem tough, just remember: nations used to fight wars for black pepper, and people were enslaved over salt.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-01 00:58:36	Happy birthday @liyaahh__
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-01 02:32:28	@ChrisPerkinsDnD @owenjwwebb @joleary97 Valyarian Steel, +50 vs. Whitewalkers?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-01 02:49:15	@joleary97 @ChrisPerkinsDnD @owenjwwebb Well, then you can't forget that old classic "fire". Whitewalkers have vulnerable 30 to fire.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-02 23:54:28	I'm not entirely sane.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-03 01:43:42	@VanessaMeneces Finals are like, tomorrow.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-03 01:55:34	@VanessaMeneces Well, it's pretty simple. Write numbers on paper. Then pray. Then wait till an answer comes.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-03 01:56:32	Rule Number 3 of being Liam Mirise: Whenever possible, answer people in a foreign language, preferably Latin, French, or German.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-03 05:24:32	The diagnosis came in guys: http://t.co/br9J2QHVJP
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-01 15:19:33	@VanessaMeneces Too much coke?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-01 15:21:26	@VanessaMeneces Saaaaammmme...
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-04 00:29:10	God, two more days and I don't have to see any of you again for at least three months! Gotta love summer!
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-04 13:51:53	Literally wearing pajamas today. I'm just done.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-05 19:47:04	@VanessaMeneces Vanessa, your twitter handle... üòÇ
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-05 19:47:26	@mollyecummings Amen.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-06 19:12:17	Aaaaand done! http://t.co/UXZzWPNY7A
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-06 19:17:29	Finished school detoxing. Thank God.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 02:10:27	@lilzvwayne It's all about the journey Lily.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 03:04:04	@kevinlopez386 @lilzvwayne It's not the forest, it's the trees.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 03:05:42	@ChrisPerkinsDnD How do I get your job?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 03:36:43	Why Scientology Is Terrifying: Scientologists bullied the IRS into submission.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 05:43:41	Basically my life http://t.co/RL7yE3jZvV
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 05:47:31	Honestly just fuck it. Like in general.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 05:51:44	@realmckayla Like, don't freak. The chance of there being a serial killer is like, 1/100. Probably.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 05:59:09	@realmckayla Like, you have seriously just a small, 1/5 chance of being murdered by a tribe of crazed mountain people. I like those odds.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 06:01:12	@realmckayla Well your also pretty, and blonde, so like, you're at a pretty steep disadvantage here.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 06:03:10	@realmckayla Like, you're basically the main character in a slasher flick right now.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 06:08:37	@realmckayla Actually there's a very specific order: 1) Minority/ racial stereotype 2) Slutty couple 3) Comic relief. The lead rarely dies.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 06:12:24	@realmckayla It's mostly driven by a desire for sequels, and the unwillingness of an American audience to watch a pretty blonde die onscreen
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 06:14:00	@realmckayla You kinda fit the trope darlin': 1) Blonde 2) White 3) Young 4) Female 5) Innocent
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 06:18:10	@realmckayla Modern horror is pretty formulaic. Sadly.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 06:49:20	@realmckayla "My love"? The French? God, sometimes Mikayla...
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-07 07:02:32	@logankearnan Hey, happy late birthday.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-08 06:35:38	@Downs_1998 Is that a talent or a physical trait?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-08 06:36:49	@Downs_1998 Kind of an important distinction. Like, where do physical characteristics end and talents begin?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-08 06:37:20	@rebekah_garcia3 @Gonzalezz25 "People will be people"?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 02:01:31	@Downs_1998 Yeah.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 03:43:38	Life Goals:
1) Beat @ecobian05 at chess.
2) Become twitter friends with @ChrisPerkinsDnD 
3) Actually carry out a goddamn DnD  Campaign
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 03:44:48	@VanessaMeneces Really? I tend to prefer Redwood girls to El D girls.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 03:46:10	@ecobian05 Choose your next words wisely. They may be your last.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 03:51:47	@VanessaMeneces That's rather presumptuous.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 03:54:14	@VanessaMeneces I'm not sure there's a correct answer here.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 03:55:14	@ecobian05 Like, one of these things in not like the others. And I honestly expected something a bit more poetic.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 04:10:40	@ecobian05 "Now comes the mystery"
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 04:12:42	@ecobian05 Nope, it's about industrialism. Dirty Commies ruin the environment same as Capitalist dogs.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 04:14:43	Got a new book coming out: http://t.co/2gLWckJcWu
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 04:16:35	@ecobian05 No, but collectivized industry works the same way, they're just run by different people.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 04:19:05	@RedScareBot @ecobian05 Ah ha! McCarthy's involved! The tables have turned Edward!
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 04:19:44	@ecobian05 @RedScareBot Run to Russia Edward!
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 05:24:23	@realmckayla You had that class like, three days ago.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 05:29:20	@realmckayla Well the class is still there, your just not a part of it anymore.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 05:33:54	@realmckayla God fucking dammit.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 05:37:43	@VanessaMeneces Thinking about me? That's what keeps most girls up at night.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 05:39:56	@VanessaMeneces Mmk. Whatever helps you sleep at night.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 05:41:10	@VanessaMeneces I seriously cannot stop laughing at how damn funny I am.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 05:53:42	@realmckayla Basically me right now http://t.co/6jljeF8ias
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-08 16:17:02	Happy birthday @andersen_sydney
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-08 17:51:10	@AnnabelleYvette Why giraffes?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-08 17:54:53	Looking for yourself on Valley Cuties, then being like, "Wait, I'm not cute."
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-08 17:55:58	@AnnabelleYvette But like, why are they your favorite? What aspect of giraffes pleases you?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-08 17:57:45	@VanessaMeneces Don't ever change Vanessa.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-08 18:06:08	@IsabelIion Like, of all the pictures...
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-08 18:08:30	@IsabelIion I feel like one of those people who has a wish granted in an ironically tragic way...
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-08 19:19:41	@ChrisPerkinsDnD @BrillitteCH Well, are tiles 2 dimensional or 3 dimensional? Are they cubes, where an unoccupied cube exists above the orc?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-08 20:29:16	Mom: Why do you have a C in Algebra 2?
Me: Don't worry, my new mixtape is dropping, I'm set for life.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-08 20:34:53	Like, at heart I'm still an awkward little 2nd grader.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 13:15:35	@Bridge_Byerlee Your pretty cute to begin with.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 13:17:49	@VanessaMeneces Oh my God. Like, again?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 23:54:57	@VanessaMeneces Stats Class? SAT? Stats homework?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 23:55:38	@Mdre_dre I told that hoe she best stop hangin' around with fuckboys.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 23:56:28	@IsabelIion Like, just hold all your emotions right here, and then someday... You'll die! üòÄüòÄüòÄ
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 23:57:12	@VanessaMeneces Vanessa, are you sure you want to be riding a bike. Like, are you even able to walk without tripping?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-09 15:05:21	@Bridge_Byerlee *you're
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 01:58:53	@VanessaMeneces Well you sound happy. What'd Christian Henry call you?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 02:01:28	When it rains during water polo, and all your stuff gets soaked.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 02:02:10	@VanessaMeneces Well, he's seeing different people.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 02:04:28	Most Likely To Die Alone: Liam Mirise. Basically my life.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 02:05:32	Happy birthday @HopeBaker98
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 02:06:09	@VanessaMeneces I'm sure it does Vanessa.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 02:14:41	@liyaahh__ And I was attesting to the statement's veracity, reflecting that I shared the sentiment.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 02:25:22	@okmxlissa I raise you a summer school class, water polo, and 3 AP Assignments
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 03:19:43	@realmckayla At least someone's having a good day
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 03:20:37	@VanessaMeneces Ahhh thanks Nessa.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 05:50:08	@vivian_napoles @fernandothewoe Wow, you're a very talented artist.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 05:51:24	@realmckayla Like, have you been taking ecstasy or something. Basically everything you've tweeted today has been euphoric.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 05:54:50	@realmckayla Good for you Mikayla.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 05:56:51	@realmckayla Don't mind me, I'm just a lonely old cynic.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 15:07:05	Summer School makes me want to shoot my self.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-11 01:58:33	@VanessaMeneces You sound happy.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-11 02:00:15	@VanessaMeneces That's great!
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-11 02:02:35	Well... My grades aren't bad.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 18:57:11	Kill me.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 18:57:38	@realmckayla Are you ok?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 18:57:48	@realmckayla Saaaame
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-10 19:51:07	Shoutout to the Summer School homies: @Serina_Sanchez @owenjwwebb
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-12 02:17:33	@VanessaMeneces Vanessa, you're friggin great sometimes. üòÇüòÇ
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-12 02:19:25	@realmckayla Do you actually schedule your selfies...?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-12 02:20:23	@realmckayla I just got a new Lenovo, and I gotta say, I kinda love it.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-12 02:21:49	@realmckayla I'm more of an "in the moment" selfie taker.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-12 02:24:37	@IsabelIion Melee: Having to do with close quarters or "hand-to-hand" combat, such as swords, knives, clubs, etc.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-12 02:25:26	@IsabelIion I read my tweets in a chronological order goddammit!
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-12 02:26:32	@realmckayla Let's face some hard truths, no one favorites my selfies anyway.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-12 02:27:12	@IsabelIion But like, no.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-12 02:28:49	@IsabelIion Well yeah, I'm kind of a dick if you haven't noticed.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-12 02:30:01	@IsabelIion Goddamnit, walked right into that...
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-11 05:18:29	@VanessaMeneces Vanessa, oh my God, your name... üòÇüòÇüòÇ
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-11 05:19:31	@owenjwwebb When I try to get my family to watch indy films.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-11 05:19:44	@VanessaMeneces Basically, yeah.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-12 21:13:18	@VanessaMeneces Well that's creepy...
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-11 18:18:12	@jamie_byerlee Wow, really?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-11 19:57:49	@Kinnn_M @danceforever195 "Fully" is a pretty strong word.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-11 19:59:15	Hey @Bridge_Byerlee , I just realized... We never signed each other's yearbooks.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-14 02:50:25	@VanessaMeneces Well thanks a lot Vanessa...
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-13 21:05:34	@VanessaMeneces So is the dream Berkley or LA?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-13 21:15:04	@VanessaMeneces Well either way you're http://t.co/U1f8zDiJIA
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-11 23:23:31	@VanessaMeneces Lol what?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-11 23:42:43	Got a new bae (My bae is my laptop. I'm so lonely) http://t.co/4dzfMwRyFv
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-13 04:27:57	@AlyssaHerrera16 @VanessaMeneces It's ok Vanessa, I'll be here. You can talk to me
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-13 05:06:30	@Bridge_Byerlee I volunteer
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-13 22:39:15	Digging "Exile on Main St." today.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-13 08:16:19	@realmckayla Sorry am√≠, but I have to agree with your beau on this one.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-13 08:17:35	@realmckayla Isn't it past your bedtime belle?
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-13 08:22:41	@realmckayla Yet still, the morning comes and time wanes on, beckoning you to that sea of dreams.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-13 08:27:38	@realmckayla Yet even then time wanes ever faster, towards that final dreamless sleep, to drift softly into nothing.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-13 08:31:00	It's a paralyzing thought, that each second past is gone forever, each a moment closer to when the clock stops forever.
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-13 08:49:31	Like, I was going to go to sleep, but I feel like I'd be leaving my fellow insomniacs hanging, @Bridge_Byerlee @realmckayla
3018663162	LiamMirise	2015-06-13 08:50:17	@realmckayla I overthink while writing tweets.
