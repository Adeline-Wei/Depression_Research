302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-09 02:40:14	@ThePHicks13 This Florida answer was a little better than the country line dancing one. But not much. I'd say she's out.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-09 02:41:07	@pcbeachNole And I think she's the prettiest one.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-09 02:41:55	@ThePHicks13 I'm picking Nevada.

302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-11 16:30:23	@hymnforrachel Think I agree...who is in the final running besides Thrasher?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-11 16:32:09	@hymnforrachel I heard they re-opened it and delayed Thrasher's interview. Are u a Thrasher proponent?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-11 16:33:46	@hymnforrachel So no opinion on who it should be? I don't like Thrasher.

302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-22 16:39:53	@KilroyFSU @hiimnichols where's his eye???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-22 16:40:23	@KilroyFSU @hiimnichols And he has an avatar ear!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-23 23:11:06	@m4ddy Us, too! Go NOLES!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-24 01:50:04	How's this for a twist? #namechange http://t.co/SFymApVM6f
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-24 03:03:01	@AMFKNole what network is that show?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-22 23:16:44	@Osceola_Tim Technically it should be about 12-1 USA.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-22 23:41:13	I BELIEVE.....!!!!!!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-22 23:43:55	@Jaboowins BEAUTIFUL USA!!!!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-23 00:50:38	@davidraider88 yes, this could be the end of me and soccer.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-23 00:54:44	@Osceola_Tim If you were Auburn or Alabama you'd know.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-23 21:01:34	@m4ddy One more payment for me...added 4 tix this year...will be worth it for a great season!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-23 21:14:50	@Seminoles_com Is the sale on original logo items? If so, great!! If not, thx, but no thx!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-23 01:07:20	@davidraider88 I'm working on it.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-23 02:40:18	@howiemandel Now I see why you wore your jeggings. #toplessdancing
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-23 04:27:18	So Tara's death was pretty anti-climatic. Smh
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-23 04:36:26	@haterofgators82 Thought that too. Actually pretty disappointed in tonight's episode. Blame it on USA soccer, I guess.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-23 04:38:48	@haterofgators82 yeah, tonight was pretty ridiculous.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-23 04:39:45	@haterofgators82 And he's my favorite, but tonight was very weak.  Should've wrapped it up last season.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-23 04:42:35	@haterofgators82 All in all, a pretty disappointing TV night - and Sunday used to be my fav.üòü
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-23 04:44:02	@haterofgators82 How many days until FSU football?????
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-23 04:45:39	@haterofgators82 Let the countdown continue!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-23 04:49:26	@haterofgators82 Yes, it got to be in those days that it was a shock when we worried about maybe losing! Hope the hype isn't too distracting
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-26 10:34:54	@FSUOsceola I believe that we...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-26 10:42:58	@hymnforrachel @andrewhirsh And what makes it even worse is to think how the SEC treats Vandy- like a red-headed stepchild! Smh
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-26 10:44:01	@FSUOsceola yes, instead of their little red-headed their stepchild.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-26 22:43:51	Help. Only person in 'Merica who missed USA soccer today...I know we lost, but what was score?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-25 00:33:16	@MrSilverScott @luis16suarez Sooo, triplets???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-25 00:43:22	@AMFKNole @BarrettSallee Tell him to put his $$$ where his üëÖis.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-25 00:44:41	@PCNHBradMilner @pcbeachNole and he looks 64!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-25 01:04:24	@CI_StatsGuru Ummm...thx for the update?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-25 01:27:49	@Warchant Perfect spot to finish as number 1.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-29 21:22:22	@FootballAU Condolences from an FSU fan who enjoyed watching this talented young player. Prayers to all who mourn him.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-29 21:28:08	@saintwarrick @USATODAYsports What a horrifically sad loss. During the Cam year of fame, Lutz was my favorite AU player to watch. Prayers.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-28 00:45:32	@ScottKotick this first half isctorture! Then... Not so bad.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-28 00:48:04	@TimBrewster it's a lot less nerve wracking knowing the outcome.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-28 00:50:16	@TimBrewster AND, I'm glad I was in the Rose Bowl and not having to listen to Brent Mushberger!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-28 00:57:29	@ChopChat_ They WERE awful, but now they ARE like steel. Knowing the final score helps. A lot.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-30 03:39:37	@Osceola_Tim Now THAT'S funny.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-01 08:34:48	@93Noles99 @Seminoles_com  Crickets.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-02 00:54:25	@KilroyFSU @MarkEnnis Eventually every team is going to look the same except for colors. #clones
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-02 00:56:06	@justindsweeney @KilroyFSU @TallahasseeJay Agree, agree, agree!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-06-29 21:08:49	@abbylutzenkir @SBNationCFB Your brother was my favorite AU player to watch. I am so sad to hear of your loss and send prayers to all.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-03 02:10:04	@davidraider88 My guess is Quilting Bees. Only thing that makes any sense. At all.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-03 03:23:43	@sportspickle Hashtag SHOULD read #thingsTimHowardCouldHaveSaved
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-02 03:23:35	@perrykos I'm over this one, but still having trouble with the Portugal one. #heartbreakers
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-05 23:54:57	@christhorman So sad.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-07 13:30:57	@Jaboowins @FSU_Football And I'm proud to say again, "that's my QB!"
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-07 23:28:06	@m4ddy @SeminoleReverie Just received this as a gift, and love it! Evidently she made several scents all titled after her favorite things.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-07 23:29:50	@SeminoleReverie @m4ddy I've spent my life at the beach, so this one brings back some great memories!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-10 13:50:00	@TomahawkNation what does third degree mean?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-12 08:48:18	@MaggieMcDee @davidraider88 Couldn't show an entire season of "moments" like FSU had, but  watch last FSU offensive play in Pasadena. Boom!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-12 21:09:55	@pcbeachNole totally agree! It's a mess!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-12 21:12:36	@pcbeachNole It just looks worse every time - and on everything - I see it! Even if I didn't disagree with it all, I still wouldn't buy it!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-12 21:27:07	@hunnypups @KHaplea33 @FSU_Football @UpliftingAth Totally agree! Going to be fun to watch Haplea this season - good guy!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-12 21:37:53	@Corey_Clark @NoleSports But article is good, and I said all along Jameis would stay for his degree. Will be interesting to see if...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-12 21:39:44	@FSUOsceola @keepthischief @melinasphotos oh no! Don't buy that new logo!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-12 21:42:18	@melinasphotos A little sad you bought new logo. üòû
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-12 21:56:48	@melinasphotos I know, but the more I see it, the more I dislike it, so I won't buy it &amp; glad I have lots of classic chief to wear.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-14 01:45:00	I thought Eric died last season? #TrueBlood
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-14 04:12:41	@FSURich @hiimnichols @davidraider88 And it was supposed to be easier to embroider. Yeah, right. Looks awful!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-14 04:17:05	@FSUNOLE21 @davidraider88 Have to say I fell for it because I do dislike new logo, but glad to know the truth. But still like classic best.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-14 04:19:22	@DanielGlauser1 Same exact thing with me today! But now guilt setting in...üòù
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-17 03:48:56	@chris11au @davidraider88 Hmmm...obviously at AU they do not teach grammar nor how to read a scoreboard. #NationalChampNoles
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-24 01:35:16	@howiemandel Plsctell me this girl doesn't fall!!! #agt
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-24 01:57:50	@howiemandel CANNOT BELIEVE you put the roller blade guy through to RCMH!! Stole a good spot from someone with TALENT!!! #AGT
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-24 22:24:28	@SeminoleOf2016 @FSUOsceola Who ARE these people and where do they get their stats??? I don't know much, but I know this post is ridiculous.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-24 22:55:53	@hymnforrachel Just for the record, I'm with Bri. And just don't buy canned tomato anything: tomato acid+ can = unhealthy. You're welcome.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-07-27 22:24:20	@davidraider88 I would only "shoot" the FS one. #hatenewlogo
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-04 11:33:16	@MadisonSocial yes, will send email - thank you!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-04 19:31:58	@EricLuallen what was the name??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-05 00:49:23	@EricLuallen Sorry to hear about Jordan Nedeau. I remember her father's name, although did not know them. So hard to lose a child...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-05 00:57:09	@hymnforrachel Thus thread of tweets made me laugh! Wish I could remember 35!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-05 01:07:25	@melinasphotos Looking forward to all your great pix thus coming season! What a great job!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-05 16:44:41	@PatrikNohe @DavidBVisser exciting news! Congratulations!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-05 23:08:16	@dannykanell @espn_security Glad you did not respond. What a sick person. Best of luck in everything@dannykanell - you're of our best NOLES!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-05 23:11:28	@RealChrisNulty I'm going thru my car repair/service guy who will go to auction and get $40k demo car (less than 10k miles) for $25-30k.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-05 23:21:22	@IanKenyonNFL Cam will have to handle him like Jameis did and build his confidence which is whole issue.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-06 00:41:37	@KellyG8r @Jaboowins Question is @KellyG8r, do you really think anyone cares what you think?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-06 00:44:47	@TallyNoleJag32 Even if they have to make it up!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-05 08:33:05	Running to catch the #SeminoleFollowTrain
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-07 03:11:42	@haterofgators82 Not that it matters to most, but I do hope we can still get merchandise with old logo. Don't hate new, but love old.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-07 03:15:10	@haterofgators82 I know, and makes me sad. Can't help it. Love the new uniforms though.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-07 03:16:55	@haterofgators82 Wonder how sales of new logo are going? Has anyone figured that?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-07 03:23:17	@haterofgators82 for me, personally, I will choose not to buy new one bec personal taste &amp; also principle. Respect others right to choose
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-07 03:27:07	@haterofgators82 well, that's a given - always!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-07 03:31:55	@PatrikNohe congrats - love his name!! Welcome to Nole Nation, Renley Brooks!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-05 12:50:46	@melinasphotos @USATODAYsports Perfect! Congrats!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-05 16:39:10	@RealChrisNulty I'm trying to make same decision. Hate the process.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-05 17:04:24	@TomahawkNation @andywittman I do have loyalties to Bowden, and think there is more to #1 coaching than just titles. #loyalfan
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-07 10:32:15	@ahaf21 Aww, just cuz we're new doesn't mean we aren't good. Thx for giving us a chance! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-06 01:51:47	@howiemandel It's really hard for me to watch Juan Carlos; love #agt but not this act!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-06 04:37:46	@TJ_Pittinger @Ab3Fr0man I followed you mainly for the Walmart stunt with the jello. Awesome.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 02:24:46	@MOTS_3 Congratulations! Prayers work!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 02:26:39	@fsunelson @Lynne_Nole @KilroyFSU @FSUMogle must be a territorial thing. #Dummies
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 02:32:21	@jbrading Happy Birthday! You're one of the main reasons I caught the #SeminoleFollowTrain! Have a good one!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 02:33:48	@MOTS_3 what will you be doing at Parks &amp; Rec?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-10 13:17:13	@harlenshack @dotson_torri Am assuming you mean "fill" up. And I agree. Either way. üòâ
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 10:22:10	@SamiNole89 @DrewGHowell And @SamiNole89 - it's better than the alternative!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 10:24:05	@SamiNole89 @DrewGHowell I speak from experience! üò¨
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:12:15	@BryceStrand @TallahasseeJay Sooo, you're kidding with the UF cleanliness thing, right???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:13:34	@BryceStrand @TallahasseeJay Eesh. Don't scare me like that.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:17:54	@BryceStrand @TallahasseeJay Will mark that down for future reference. Except not quite sure how that 1 time out of 100 could ever occur.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:19:26	@BryceStrand @TallahasseeJay you're a better person than I. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:23:24	@BryceStrand @TallahasseeJay Not to mention the idiots of UF, Miami, Clemson or the SEC in general!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:25:49	@BryceStrand @TallahasseeJay Gotcha. As I ssid, you're better than most. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:26:43	@TallahasseeJay @BryceStrand but not playing is no fun!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:28:36	@BryceStrand @TallahasseeJay I might agree with that.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:31:04	@BryceStrand @TallahasseeJay Ha! I wouldn't say clearly right.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:33:36	@BryceStrand @TallahasseeJay Absolutely. Of course. No doubt whatsoever. Clearly.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:34:52	@jbrading @PhenomeNoles @dtackett_ Herr we go again.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:35:25	@jbrading @PhenomeNoles @dtackett_ HERE we go again.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:36:02	@jbrading @PhenomeNoles @dtackett_ haha - caught you! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:41:09	@BryceStrand MORE sarcasm. Geez.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:43:19	@BryceStrand yeah, now I was being sarcastic. ;-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-08 03:44:50	@BryceStrand whatever.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-10 22:29:37	@SeminoleReverie So I have to ask, what were you wearing when the DNJ criticized you??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-10 22:34:43	@SeminoleReverie tone on tone - cool. But now I'm wondering where you were that you could stand wearing a SWEATER???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-10 22:36:38	@SeminoleReverie got it. Hotter than the hinges of hell outside today. Hour store sounds like heaven right now.;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-10 22:36:57	@SeminoleReverie your
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-10 23:41:17	@pcbeachNole How was the temp?? Hottest I have ever been was in Tally, specifically at the Doak!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-11 01:09:53	@pcbeachNole ;) I gotcha. Love Tally, but some of the hottest summers were spent there as an undergrad! Then 1st season tix in E stands-whew
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-11 02:06:40	@TomahawkNation maybe too cuz what happened to UF player as result of fight?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-09 14:29:02	@TJ_Pittinger Ok, I have a huge confession. I did not watch or listen to the Pitt game. It was not on my radar and neither was Jameis. #bad
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-09 14:33:41	@TJ_Pittinger Yeah, but this year a whole new story. Have watched NOLES all my life...what were your fav Pitt plays?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-09 15:06:39	@TJ_Pittinger Awesome. Truly the beginning of a great story.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-12 12:38:01	@SamiNole89 @Dan_Noles I'm relatively new too in this Twitter world, but welcome, it's a great place to be!#NoleFam
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-12 12:45:01	@TomahawkNation @JCameronShow It's a need for sure, but let's be positive and give them time and encouragement to rise to occasion.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-12 12:49:11	@HistoryInPics @SamiNole89 is there anything this genius didn't/couldn't do??? He will be soooo missed.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-12 15:49:59	@93Noles99 Doubt they will. Have lost so much respect for ESPN over the years. Anything goes to sell a show.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-12 22:08:51	@SeminoleReverie many businesses have banned it for employees / cuz allergies.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-09 02:18:09	@ThePHicks13 @espn was that KB making the catch?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-09 02:22:14	@ThePHicks13 @espn @KBREDZONE and not his usual 10 feet up in the air catch - didn't know he could also dive!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-09 02:29:06	@FSUnoleSC I've been a fan since God was a baby. And this alumna has DRIVEN the bandwagon when needed. Proud of my NOLES-Always.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-09 03:11:52	@93Noles99 Did his current coaches not watch the NOLES last yesr???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-09 03:21:39	@AMFKNole A diving grab - not his usual sky hook! #versatility
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-10 00:54:28	@LostLettermen Arrogantly funny, mercilessly truthful.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-13 03:56:21	@TJ_Pittinger @HallieBerger_ Madison Social is a true leader of Nole Nation!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-13 22:24:17	@ThePHicks13 garnets look very different?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-13 22:29:57	@ThePHicks13 the vintage look.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-13 22:32:48	@ThePHicks13 yes, was going to say same thing, but am trying to shut up about the logo thing. ;/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-13 22:35:31	@ThePHicks13 have tried, but just don't like it. Not hatin', just not likin'. ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-15 12:46:58	@TallyNoleJag32 I never took mine off.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-15 13:01:41	@simon0108 @RavensInsider He learned about eliminating mistakes (clutter) under Jimbo at FSU.  Way to go, Timmy! #GoNOLES &amp;Ravens!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-15 13:10:20	@TomahawkNation @FSU_Laura @dannykanell yeah, Tally is hot as hinges of hell in August, but no swamp! That town really IS hell.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-17 01:00:50	@davidraider88 @BushidoNole Mine too! Just kill me now.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-17 01:05:13	@MojoFishing Home sweet home!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-19 02:44:44	@AMFKNole ok, so I thought you meant Urban was giving out beer at practice.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-16 16:47:34	@SamiNole89 @wjxt4 just switched to it...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-18 00:32:04	@JustCallMeNOLE are there any other Noles on Panthers?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-16 17:03:43	@pcbeachlaw @eireryn I NEED this!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-16 17:05:37	@Puntrooskie @drewjjones84 @TomahawkNation Quit scaring me.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-16 17:09:15	@Jensantijamison There is a TINY part of me that hopes the gatas improve this year cuz it's no contest to bait them at this point. #losers
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-16 19:28:25	@TJ_Pittinger uh...the Natty in a Pasadena!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-16 19:32:19	@SeminoleReverie May I ask where/what is your store?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-17 03:23:38	@hymnforrachel And it just never gets old. I would hate to admit how many times I've watched it.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-17 03:29:16	@TylerCommaJohn @alexclouden84 never will forget being in the stands for that 4th qtr. The. Best. Ever.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-17 03:34:24	@TheEsquireof212 Don't think you meant this to be funny. But it made me smile anyway.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-17 03:39:53	@TheEsquireof212 It's realistic humor. We can all relate. I need to do a count. 11 might be too high.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-17 03:41:26	@TheEsquireof212 yeah, on any given day my number could fluctuate by 7 or 8.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-17 03:44:24	Even though I know the outcome, these last few plays still stop my heart.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-20 03:01:15	@hymnforrachel Funny how the light of day makes everything better. Glad we're not vampires.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-20 13:21:26	@EricLuallen @hymnforrachel Definitely poorly veiled threat.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-20 13:25:58	@edsbs @gothlaw Now that's SECary!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-20 21:52:27	@jbrading Who doesn't agree - Bama  die hards? All I know is he has a lot of personal history there.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-20 21:54:22	@HowardTheDoak @BryceStrand but have you tried buttered coffee??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-20 21:56:13	@jbrading Hmmm...not that I don't believe you but...who-Bear? Shug? Split state gives Bobby the advantage?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-21 14:01:40	@MadisonSocial oops/typo! That would be Birthday!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-21 13:59:47	@MadisonSocial Happy 1st Burthday! You're a welcome addition to Nole Nation!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-22 19:06:18	@jmnpb996 @TheOneBarrelRum @SugarBowlNola @CFBPlayoff So in twitter space pls explain how playoff will work.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-22 19:11:04	@TJ_Pittinger @jmnpb996 @TheOneBarrelRum @SugarBowlNola @CFBPlayoff and where does each one of those playoffs happen?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-22 19:14:06	@SugarBowlNola @TJ_Pittinger @jmnpb996 @CFBPlayoff So agree, very hard for fans to make plans, reservations!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-22 19:18:01	@TJ_Pittinger @SugarBowlNola @jmnpb996 @CFBPlayoff  So 1v4 and 2v3 happen on same day? Sorry to be so obtuse.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-22 19:20:24	@SugarBowlNola And will we know pretty much who as we near end of seadon, or will committee have power to choose more randomly?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-22 19:20:37	@SugarBowlNola season
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-22 19:23:19	@TJ_Pittinger @SugarBowlNola @jmnpb996 @CFBPlayoff So bottom line where do you think FSU will be?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-22 19:27:22	@SugarBowlNola @TJ_Pittinger @jmnpb996 Got it! Thx for help. Does sound like nye in nola makes most sense for me.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-22 19:30:14	@TJ_Pittinger @SugarBowlNola @jmnpb996 Thanks again - see you in the Big Easy!  Go NOLES!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-20 21:37:37	@BrennanIdeson @sportspickle All business at the sides, party on the top.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-20 21:47:18	@jbrading I'd agree Bowden by far, even in Bama. Did you see his  new book trailer?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-20 23:56:36	@BryceStrand @HowardTheDoak You should start - google it! Good for you.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-21 01:12:41	@BryceStrand @HowardTheDoak wonder if it works in beer??? ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-21 01:14:24	@BryceStrand @HowardTheDoak Ok, so forget the whole damn thing! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-21 01:19:06	Sad that I'm not  going to Dallas...;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-21 01:21:29	@VALadyNole @BryceStrand @HowardTheDoak now why didn't I think of that?Great idea!! I think even @MadisonSocial has butter beer on the menu!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-21 01:23:16	@VALadyNole @BryceStrand @HowardTheDoak @MadisonSocial think in past for HP trivia??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-21 01:26:30	@MadisonSocial @VALadyNole @BryceStrand @HowardTheDoak MadSoc always on cutting edge!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-21 01:29:40	@VALadyNole @MadisonSocial @BryceStrand @HowardTheDoak Right there with ya, Sistuh!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-21 01:32:58	@BryceStrand @VALadyNole @MadisonSocial @HowardTheDoak Save your $$ and get there!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-23 02:51:35	@T1TheMC @FSUNolegurl are they bedroom slippers??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-23 11:45:15	@Jensantijamison @jbrading I'm thinking high, but not dry
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-27 23:19:05	@ThePHicks13 wth are lunars??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-27 23:21:17	@TJ_Pittinger @Caraleigh24 Good start to a great trip! Safe travels and GO NOLES!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 00:20:47	@jmnpb996 Agree, though, voice is hard to listen to in some way.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 00:22:22	Exactly WHAT is ULM wearing??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 00:31:40	@AMFKNole ULM worse. Duck Dynasty.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 00:43:06	@DT2_28 @DeweyKevin Welcome to Nole Nation! You'll love it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 00:54:07	@FSUAlumni @SamiNole89 @FSU_SCNT thought the 20    14 was score prediction!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 01:01:38	@FSUnconquered Ha! Clutching their pearls...LOL!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 01:03:55	@LostLettermen What a numbskull. Emphasis on numb. And skull.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 01:05:45	@seminole4life22 Sarcasm or real?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 01:07:28	@seminole4life22 Well, he should! IMO ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-28 12:31:13	@cll1019 So true! I'm right there with you!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-28 12:34:14	@PhenomeNoles So wrong on so many levels. All. Levels. All. Wrong. Couldn't finish watching.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 00:59:09	@FSU_SCNT @FSUAlumni @SamiNole89 ha! But love the shirt anyway! Way to represent out there in big ole Texas!! Go NOLES!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-28 11:58:57	@osfsu @pcbeachlaw Had pleasure of meeting Payton at Rose Bowl in January. Thank you Jimbo and Team for making all NOLES proud in this!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-28 12:01:51	@C_MySide @pcbeachlaw Couldn't play the first down without the mighty Chiefs! Never lost a half-time!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-28 12:03:16	@m4ddy Soooo jealous! #dallastodallas GO NOLES!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-28 12:15:35	@LogansTwitty @SamiNole89 Great job!! Feels:pride, confidence, strength, determination,excitement,loyalty,and just a little nervous!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-28 12:26:29	@BushidoNole Example of extremely poor marketing at best.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-28 12:36:22	@hymnforrachel only sometimes?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 05:24:37	Don't think I can watch a season of SEC Network. #annoyinglybiased
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 10:02:37	@RyanLKel @AriyaMassoudi @AGallina2010 @A2atFSU ROAD TRIP!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 10:05:58	@WillieGeist Actually thought about you last night...game was over about time you get up for work on Today! My sympathies but...GO NOLES!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 10:08:44	@FSUChiefs Hang in there - couldn't do game without y'all! Safe travels!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 10:10:45	@perrykos yep, you ARE in Nola.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-29 10:14:30	@saintwarrick Guess you got the email.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-27 13:08:04	@TheRickWilson @EricLuallen @CharlieCrist @Ricochet Shark eyes for Scott too...no good choice!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-30 22:36:16	@alexclouden84 score??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-30 22:38:04	@alexclouden84 meant time left??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 00:42:02	@ScalmEm Also do not like these YELLOW helmets!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 00:48:55	@LMaez44 @VALadyNole yes and YELLOW helmets
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 02:58:43	@FSUNOLE21 @TomahawkNation WE NEED A PUNTER!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 02:59:49	What is happening to the D???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 03:03:26	@VALadyNole @blackburnrobert @SportsNation definitely need a big bonfire for these unis after tonight.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 03:05:04	@VALadyNole @blackburnrobert @SportsNation doubt they would bring more than about $.35
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 03:12:31	@Timinole which has been most of night
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 03:49:09	I see you in your plaid hat on TV @melinasphotos !!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 03:50:08	@themikegreen54 it looked awful. Lots of work to be done!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 03:53:28	@KilroyFSU @pboulware agree. And the purple face masks. And the yellow helmets.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 03:55:48	@SectionBAnimals @MostlyNoles maybe, but these looked cheap and ugly and washed out. Sorry, but true. Not our colors!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 03:56:51	@TJ_Pittinger did UF lose tonight???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-01 00:32:09	@SectionBAnimals for what team??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-01 00:33:42	@SectionBAnimals on now? Channel?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-01 00:35:51	@SectionBAnimals thx - LYMI ( love ya, mean it) !
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-01 01:07:59	@_TomBlock Did Jimbo say anything about punter issues???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 03:59:19	@TJ_Pittinger Lightening and rain? Never started game?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 04:03:55	@ChopChat_ SHOT!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 04:04:28	@VALadyNole again I say, bonfire!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 04:06:36	@LogansTwitty But it was a little too close for comfort.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 04:15:03	@matteocarr @tpnolefan1 @NicholasPartin so did they play the gator game at all??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 04:25:25	@themikegreen54 They looked really sad. Made me ill.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 04:43:39	@themikegreen54 just didn't look like champions. Play calling was weird. Kept going to Rashad or Los - like there were no other choices?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 04:48:52	Maybe we fans were guilty of too much hype for first game.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 04:50:49	@themikegreen54 Definitely, and maybe we fans were over-hyped for game just like we worried about for players. Anyway will take the W!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 04:53:31	@m4ddy Yes, and that goes for our yellow helmets too!  Garnet and GOLD, not yellow!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 04:55:47	@FSUOsceola And with no pressure!! I'm sure his momma loves him, but we need a punter!!!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 04:57:25	@m4ddy On TV, we looked shaky on both, while newbies on OKST looked like vets!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 05:00:12	@PatrikNohe what were Jameis' post game interview comments?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 05:01:50	@jmnpb996 were u at game? Looked bad on TV for sure.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 05:03:16	@PatrikNohe Good. Looked REALLY down on tv at end. Why was he only throwing to Rashad?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 05:09:59	@nolanolegal @jmnpb996 a Think the announcer called it "lumbering". ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 05:21:20	@FlaStateGameday @Warchant_Willie Understatement. Fan base was pretty quiet too
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 05:22:32	@Jensantijamison Ditto. Surprised he was able to play at all.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 05:25:36	@danofero14 How bout we just focus on next game instead of playoffs?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 05:28:55	@danofero14 yes but think that was part of problem tonight. Just focus on one game at a time so you can GET to playoffs.same as last year.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 05:30:53	@danofero14 ;) it was a rough night...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 05:32:56	@danofero14 Well take comfort in fact that it looked worse on TV AND you had to listen to tv commentators.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 10:11:18	@saintwarrick Looked awful on TV. Purple plum face masks didn't help. And the white pants were just plain embarrassing.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 10:13:33	@DavidBVisser @melinasphotos Now that's teamwork. Shining moment in a scary game.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 10:23:58	@saintwarrick I don't know who makes the FSU uniform decisions, but I hope they're on Twitter. Can't ignore these uni issues!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 10:27:09	@DavidBVisser The whole uni look was weaker than our punting.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-31 13:14:02	@hymnforrachel @PhenomeNoles Me too! We are just not used to close calls.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-30 12:36:11	@LuvDemNoles22 How about 2 plane tix / I'm still in Florida 
;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-30 12:44:34	@LuvDemNoles22 Good luck! I did RT for you. Now you gotta cheer twice as hard for those of us stuck at home! Go NOLES!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-30 12:48:45	@LuvDemNoles22 I'm saving up for our NEXT game in Dallas! Pull them through tonight!  Enjoy it all-tweet pix!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-30 13:52:51	@LogansTwitty Seriously.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-01 01:53:04	Watching FSU replay, trying to be objective with back to future info.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-01 02:18:05	@perrykos We have NO ROOM to talk about bad uniforms! Ours were worst ever.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-01 02:20:26	@LogansTwitty they aren't playing now are they??!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-01 02:24:33	@IraSchoffel Trying to tough it out. Still painful. Like childbirth.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-30 16:53:18	@KiefOsceola I vowed not to be logo negative on Game Day, but with me, it's more than that. But for today I don't care - it's GAME DAY!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-08-30 16:59:56	@KiefOsceola True! But also choosing not to wear or buy it. Prefer look and tradition of original, but always love my NOLES no matter Nike.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-01 03:36:28	@TJ_Pittinger TV said way more FSU than OKST / and OKST right around corner.,,
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-01 03:41:49	@TJ_Pittinger Announcers were shocked at numbers of Nole fans! Made me proud! Good on y'all!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-01 07:33:03	@DavidBVisser @ChopChat_ Dedication. Thx!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-01 07:39:10	@DavidBVisser @ChopChat_ Get off Twitter and get some rest!!! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-01 07:40:32	@NOvieraLE up here too. What rumor?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-01 07:52:05	@NOvieraLE But was friend's mom?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-01 07:55:10	@saintwarrick And helmets to match. Yolk yuck!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-02 19:41:12	Everybody - Keep Calm and Trust Jimbo.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-02 19:42:22	@DevinFSU no matter, the whole look was not good.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-02 12:48:09	@dubee24 @jbrading Yeah, case closed.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-02 12:56:32	@PatrikNohe NOW, I get it!  Method to the madness.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-02 13:05:40	@PatrikNohe Another great story! Thx for being on the job!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-04 15:30:31	@danofero14 when? What channel?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-05 01:50:53	@KilroyFSU is there a college game on now??? Help!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-05 01:52:12	@KilroyFSU @ChrisDobbertean is there cfb game on tonight?!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-05 01:53:20	@ChrisDobbertean @KilroyFSU No Boston College??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-05 01:55:00	@ChrisDobbertean @KilroyFSU Friday night???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 00:16:07	@TGMowerman @TheEsquireof212 @ChampsNolesRule Curious: does your # say "all that's lacking" or "all that slacking"??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 00:21:33	@TheEsquireof212 @TGMowerman @ChampsNolesRule Glad that's it, although it was a cool double entendre. Go NOLES!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 00:43:01	@KBREDZONE @JustCallMeNOLE @canfish16 Proud to watch you play today! Nole alum!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 01:01:54	@Panthers @JustCallMeNOLE So proud of our KB!! Once a Nole, always a Nole!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 01:17:35	@danofero14 Hate to say it, but team doesn't seem good as last year across board.  Unfair to depend solely on Jameis. Maybe time helps.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 01:29:36	@BlackBlueReview @JustCallMeNOLE Just normal catch for a NOLE! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 01:41:18	@TGMowerman @danofero14 Hope u r right and I am wrong! But I'm still worried. Should've beaten Cit bigger, and if feel a lite better.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 01:44:25	@TGMowerman @danofero14 correction: and I'd feel a lot better. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 01:48:18	@TGMowerman @danofero14 Hope I can take you seriously, but that avi.., ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 01:51:57	@IraSchoffel @chrishillfsu @Jeff_fromthePC With all the concerns and new rules re injurious play, why is cutblocking legal??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 01:52:49	@Bamalawyer @IraSchoffel @Warchant @Jeff_fromthePC @espn AND probably Jameis' fault.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 01:55:13	@shinny006 @SamiNole89 @dudewithgauges And how many YEARS it took???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 01:58:08	@saintwarrick It's not the comment that infuriates me; it's the intent to injure.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 01:59:55	@SamiNole89 @shinny006 @dudewithgauges So unfair!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 02:42:44	@m4ddy True we have come a long way from that, but staying a long way from that is the hard part,
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 02:51:24	@TheOneBarrelRum @EricLuallen @canfish16 I looked for him too! Tell him we miss him. Sending prayers for good/quick recovery!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 02:56:38	@KilroyFSU @TheOneBarrelRum @hymnforrachel Had same concerns but was told to trust Jimbo/process.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 02:59:33	@m4ddy I was there too, and don't want to return! ;) Last year prolly was exception, and repeating an even bigger exception. Fun trying tho
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 03:05:30	@m4ddy Totally agree. No need for meanness. Definitely still kids (AND male!) Plus it's still a GAME, isn't it???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-09 01:43:03	@not_romo Seriously, what has happened to Eli? He used to be good. No?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-09 17:41:07	@TomahawkNation Another Nike disaster.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-09 17:44:52	@DHearn91 @seminole4life22 You have got to be kidding me!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 13:00:37	@NMoralesNBC my dog, Mathis, looks like he could be related to yours! http://t.co/CPWkRwg7O2
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 15:00:59	@NMoralesNBC And "crazy smart" like her, too! Enjoyed the segment and what you bring to the Today Show team! Thx for the reply!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 15:07:40	@tpnolefan1 Hate that we can't tweet or message during game! Guess we need to be satisfied to be in the moment! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 15:10:21	@tpnolefan1 Yep, friends not in attendance begging for updates and pix- so sorry! Should have bought season tix like me!  Ha!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 15:48:24	@PhenomeNoles Man up.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 15:51:46	@danofero14 AND we can pay to start tailgating at 8:00 am?? #nocryinginfootball
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-08 15:57:11	@danofero14 I hear you! And traffic pattern out of Lot 14 sucks when I want to go back downtown.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-10 21:29:12	@Timinole "So you mean someone lied?" she asked naively.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 02:05:05	@dannykanell Right. Left is too much brown. Next question? ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 02:10:49	@PhenomeNoles that is all so freaky...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-10 03:51:43	@Phillips Would love to contact you regarding a fundraiser for Habitat for Humanity to be held in one of your tour cities.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 03:27:05	@danofero14 Did that make you less nervous??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 03:27:55	@danofero14 Yeah, me too...?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 03:31:27	@danofero14 they should rush the crap outta him in practice!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 03:33:21	@URBABYSDADDY80 @danofero14 yeah, that doesn't help. I do remember being totally shocked during Clemson. Like really shocked.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 03:35:32	@URBABYSDADDY80 @danofero14 True. Clemson was the game. Same again this year.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 03:37:04	@danofero14 @URBABYSDADDY80 yeah, and I'm nervous again now. Thx.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 03:40:55	@URBABYSDADDY80 @danofero14 prolly so on National level, but on local level it's also Clempson. Yikes.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 03:44:04	@URBABYSDADDY80 @danofero14 Hope it's more than 10 pts and I will be nervous until all zeros on clock. Did we def get Game Day?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 03:46:05	@danofero14 @URBABYSDADDY80 Ok, I'm calling for 14 pt victory. üôèüôè
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 03:50:18	Love it as usual!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 03:50:36	@melinasphotos Perfect!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 11:58:45	@hymnforrachel I was at work and secretary told me between meetings. I pictured a little Cessna in some freak accident snagging its wing. No
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 12:00:56	@hymnforrachel Such a scary, long morning. I gathered both of my children and just held on.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 12:07:01	@shinny006 @NChen09 Fun ain't cheap! ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 12:09:51	@hodakotb My condolences to you for a man we owe a lot . Thx for what you bring to our lives each day. You make him proud.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 12:17:29	@harlenshack You def did the right thing. Glad you're safe. And you may have saved someone else's life!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 12:18:52	@shinny006 @Jmacfsu24 Too much multi-tasking. Slow down!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 12:25:08	@shinny006 @Jmacfsu24 I totally get it! When I go for mani/pedi or hair appt, I go crazy thinking of what I should be doing!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-11 12:31:01	@shinny006 @Jmacfsu24 makes me feel guilty for complaining about it. #firstworldproblems
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-12 21:56:34	@ClemsonTom @MattMacJames @JOENOLES Poor guy. Trying to be a good hubby. I applaud you!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-12 22:02:07	@ClemsonTom @MattMacJames @JOENOLES My daughter dates an Auburn man. It's a constant struggle about who's gonna wear what!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-12 21:50:32	@idontwan2know Yep, we had a Japanese plum tree in our yard that my grandmother favored. I hated that tree.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-12 22:05:01	@ClemsonTom @MattMacJames @JOENOLES True. You can cheat that orange. No go with FSU/AU.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 02:28:11	Miss Florida (State) danced beautifully! #TeamTori #notetogod
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 02:36:43	@SeminoleReverie And she evidently beat out a violinist?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 02:38:54	@SeminoleReverie She did great! Lyrical dance / beautiful. Way better than first lyrical dancer in a silver lame' gym dress.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 02:40:37	@TallyNoleJag32 @SeminoleReverie Mark Brunells daughter. She was on pointe tho
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 02:48:36	@NateAndrews29 @JustCallMeNOLE We're all behind you Nate! #nolenation
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 02:49:40	@davidraider88 She did ok. Tough questions.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 02:50:35	@RulesForBelles @SamiNole89 Soooo true. And hilarious.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 02:52:27	@SamiNole89 @davidraider88 Agree. They were heavy duty. Glad she didn't get the one about rape on college campuses.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 02:54:41	@PhenomeNoles yes, she looked super nervous. Still can't believe the cup girl or dummy handler.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 02:57:11	Miss New York is jumping around from head to toe. Weird.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 02:58:57	@KySportsRadio was that her talent???!i hate these damn things
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 03:01:00	@SeminoleReverie I SWEAR (for the millionth time) I will NEVER watch another beauty pageant!!! My girl NEVER wins!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 03:02:46	@jmnpb996 @SeminoleReverie good grief.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 03:05:44	@travreg @TallyNoleJag32 @MissFlorida2014 Third Runner-Up sounds much better though. Was very proud of our Nole!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 03:07:56	@davidraider88 But the Committee still picked her. Smh
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 03:09:58	@davidraider88 Good question.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 03:12:02	@SPRINGBR3AK98 don't forget the dummy handler.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 03:31:07	@Phillips Hoping to talk with you re: Habitat for Humanity project when you come to St Aug on Nov 9. Fingers crossed!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 12:56:30	New song by Alicia Keys so inspirational! #wearehere #today
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 13:10:16	@harlenshack @ClemsonTom And he wore a Gator shirt to please his wife. Can't be all that bad. Thx for helping @Kidz1stFund .
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-15 14:00:29	I feel your pain. Begging Artist. http://t.co/Xf1QRthMM1
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-14 00:23:28	@saintwarrick @BruinReport kinda like gators tackling gators
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-14 00:41:14	Tebow looks rough,
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-13 03:21:00	@KirkHerbstreit @GamecockFB @FootballUGA I, for one, just can't wait to see Spurrier's headset and visor hit the ground..,over &amp; over-Dawgs!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-14 01:16:30	And now we get to listen to a grown man named "Booger"??? Thanks SEC.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-14 01:50:31	@Moojenowski Not as good as UK.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-14 02:05:33	Gators get lucky again.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-14 02:22:40	Someone tell me again about these SEC defenses...?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-14 02:28:16	Wow! My other Alma Mater whipping up on USC! #whodathunkit
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-13 14:20:15	@cdowlar Who is @PatrickASchmidt and what does he know???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-13 14:26:19	@Timinole @KH0W_ Yes, a predicate adjective to be exact. But don't expect those dillweeds to know that.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 14:27:39	@CollegeGameDay thx for the extra motivation. Go NOLES!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 14:32:59	@m4ddy I wouldn't have recognized her.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-13 23:47:34	So completely grateful Musberger went to SEC.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 14:40:28	@Phillips @TODAYshow zzz LOVE your new song. Lyrics are priceless!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-13 23:55:06	@TGMowerman drives me nuts! Soooo lame.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-13 23:57:20	@DRusso97 @jmnpb996 @Morgan_Moriarty Tiny Johnson?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-13 23:58:29	@idontwan2know Pretty sure he left it in Tally.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-14 00:04:15	@ScottJDonahoe yeah, how are he and Jimbo friends????
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-14 00:05:22	@ScottJDonahoe worries me just a little
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 20:30:55	@LostLettermen Are we SURE it was him and quote is correct?? If so, when is he ever going to make life easier???!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 21:04:47	@KiefOsceola If it was his only non-story, I would agree, but with his others...like him, but getting harder to defend him to his critics
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 21:17:32	@BillyTownsend @jmnpb996 @BruceFeldmanCFB @FSU_Football Now let's not get crazy here. It was dumb, not criminal. As per usual.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 21:25:03	@BillyTownsend @jmnpb996 @BruceFeldmanCFB @FSU_Football Still not reason to suspend! If so, would suspend about half of kids on campus.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 03:14:49	@hymnforrachel As an aside, I think I am surprised you are a thrasher supporter.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 03:18:33	@SeatGeekNCAA This really isn't a concern.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 03:21:54	@shinny006 Section 37!! DOAK!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 12:09:26	@hymnforrachel yes, I can see where that would be a plus, but other qualifications important too. Like being a supporter of education.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 12:12:09	@Phillips Me!! Still hoping to hear from you regarding habitat project! üôè
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 12:15:06	@hymnforrachel Sorry, guess I misread. Have had local experience with him and really hate that he is the FSU choice. Sounds like many agree.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 12:30:10	@hymnforrachel I think it's only a handful who were outspoken, but many who agree. Enjoy/encourage diversity, but not for mere sake of it.;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 12:36:05	@m4ddy Sounds like great temps - esp cuz we will be packed in there!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 12:38:01	@IraSchoffel @SeanKorte WHY did he do that??distraction??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-14 00:11:38	@TheOneBarrelRum Living on borrowed time.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 21:13:44	@BrosOfWarchant @KingHarris_9 That doesn't make sense. Why would he confess to it? That solves nothing and ESPN is having a heyday!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 21:21:00	@TheRealEazy32 well, don't start now!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 01:15:51	@TGMowerman @jbrading @TheEsquireof212 @KiefOsceola Perfect opportunity for family to act like family.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 01:21:20	@BeeJayCee02 @ABSFSU1 and I think he took responsibility today. Let's hope THIS time it means enough for him to think before he acts/speaks.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 01:24:25	@saintwarrick @CFTalk People will prolly blame Jameis for this too.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 21:36:20	@perrykos you may be right.I'm fairly old &amp;white, &amp; I love my QB, but dont find this funny. Wish he was more aware of his role to all ages.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 21:38:18	@perrykos So help me feel younger. Why is it funny?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 21:44:40	@BillyTownsend @jmnpb996 @BruceFeldmanCFB @FSU_Football Agree, but STILL contend none of that is 
"suspendable" offense, QB or no.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 21:46:57	@BillyTownsend @jmnpb996 @BruceFeldmanCFB @FSU_Football Suspending from game or partial game up to Jimbo. Thought u were talking school susp
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 21:52:23	@PhenomeNoles Still think JW hasn't learned that with his notoriety comes more responsibility to consider what he says and does. Always.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 21:53:35	@PhenomeNoles Or maybe he just doesn't care. Life lessons.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 21:59:08	@BillyTownsend @BruceFeldmanCFB @FSU_Football Social media, esp Twitter is like a mating call to them. My own kids sometimes embarrass me,
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 22:01:01	@BillyTownsend @BruceFeldmanCFB @FSU_Football but then again, reverse is also true. I still love them. JW has a long way to go-maybe prayer?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 22:08:39	@PhenomeNoles @Coryspath @Timinole Think also it's the cumulative effect from BB's to Burger King to Meggs to crab legs to tabletop yelling.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 22:10:47	@JoshOz76 @BillyTownsend @BruceFeldmanCFB @FSU_Football Now Josh, don't YOU overreact. We're just talking.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 22:13:21	@I_B_Phil @PhenomeNoles And in this corner...lol
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 22:15:19	@perrykos Oh my. I am old. But thx for trying.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 22:19:29	@JoshOz76 @BillyTownsend @BruceFeldmanCFB @FSU_Football I know that now. I get it. Still IMO, he should tone it down for his own sake.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 22:25:32	@Timinole Just had that Twitter conversation. Would have to bench most of team plus half of coaches if language was suspendable offense.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 22:27:38	@Timinole oops. Meant this response above for @PhenomeNoles tweet about benching.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 22:35:03	@JoshOz76 @BillyTownsend @BruceFeldmanCFB @FSU_Football I know that, but would you agree that as leader, he might consider better actions?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 22:36:31	@JoshOz76 @BillyTownsend @BruceFeldmanCFB @FSU_Football not expecting sainthood, just more thought before he acts since he is scrutinized.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 22:42:53	@JoshOz76 @BillyTownsend @BruceFeldmanCFB @FSU_Football I saw this already, just would like to think my QB was above such. Guess not. ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 22:46:40	@TheRealEazy32 trying to decide on 6 or 6+...of course I wish there was now a 6.5!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 22:55:56	@JoshOz76 @BillyTownsend @BruceFeldmanCFB No need to be rude. He IS my QB, &amp; yours. &amp; am proud, but don't agree with all of his choices.enuf
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 23:01:36	@JoshOz76 @BillyTownsend @BruceFeldmanCFB Tell you what - why don't you gtfoh? Thx for playing.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 23:03:33	@EricLuallen Totally agree. And I've just been toldI was obviously never 20. ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 23:04:30	@TJ_Pittinger Well, that's a great name!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 23:07:04	@SamiNole89 Trust me. Don't ask.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 23:15:44	@JoshOz76 Omg. I was over it long ago. If my opinion doesn't matter, then quit responding.Its not yr place to judge what I can discuss. Stop
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 23:18:24	@melinasphotos Best decision you'll ever make! 
You ready for lots of game photos this weekend? Getting psyched!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 23:29:11	@JoshOz76 A negative opinion about his action today is not judging HIM. Now get off my case and quit judging ME. I want best for him,do you?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 23:34:18	@casey_lorenzen good luck!! Come back alive / we've got another football game on Saturday! #beatclemson
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 01:44:23	@DipRip @TomahawkNation Very good point!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 01:49:36	@seminolemendy Unfortunately comes with territory of celebrity.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 01:51:19	@LilBitSouth @jbrading They don't if you learn from them.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 01:52:09	@KilroyFSU Suggest you read Tomahawk Nation article.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 01:54:37	@headshrunk That's about what I would expect from TMZ. Hope kids have more sense than to be used like that.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 01:56:43	@sam_ponder just like her namesake - good traveler!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 03:30:11	@TallahasseeJay Read Tomahawk Nation article. Might help.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 04:07:36	@TallahasseeJay It's objective and devoid of petty judgments.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 23:49:25	@TallyNoleJag32 @jmnpb996 but we weren't all famous. Big difference in the size of our microscopes. And we all know size DOES matter.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 23:52:19	@Timinole I say let Jimbo handle it. Not my yob.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 23:53:22	@Timinole but opinion is not a suspendable offense, tho not smart either considering his usual scrutiny.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-16 23:54:24	@TallyNoleJag32 @jmnpb996 man! Ain't that the truth?!?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 04:32:27	@93Noles99 Yes, got put in my place yesterday by young man who said I had no right to discuss topic as I obviously was never 20! Lololol
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 11:38:57	@PhenomeNoles Tally will be a great reward! Hang in!  Go NOLES!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 12:00:03	@BrosOfWarchant It would make me happy for this to be true!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 12:07:47	@BrosOfWarchant @fsuAndrew50 I certainly didn't want it to be- just the opposite! First thing I asked yesterday was are we SURE??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 12:09:42	@BrosOfWarchant Yay!! Maybe Jameis doesn't care, but I am happy for him and sorry I didn't question further! Twitter lesson for me!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 12:11:21	@BrosOfWarchant @fsuAndrew50 And there was a group who thought it hilarious and he was cool for having done it.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 12:12:49	@ThePHicks13 @YahooForde I am thrilled to hear it wasn't him! I BELIEVE!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 12:17:13	@TallahasseeJay Agree! Twitter lesson for me!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 12:33:18	@EricLuallen @hymnforrachel my first ? yesterday was are we SURE, and I believed two tweets who said they were there and def him. #lesson4me
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 12:34:52	@hymnforrachel @EricLuallen yeah. that's my lesson.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 12:40:20	@hymnforrachel @EricLuallen In defense, didn't want to believe it but "eye witness"confirmed it. One is not enough. Agree,jumped too quick.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 12:41:34	@EricLuallen @hymnforrachel Yes, immediacy of social media changing that for the negative.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 12:51:37	Mine were easy. Just do what they tell you to recover..
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 13:16:30	Just two more morning coffees before GAME DAY!! GO NOLES! http://t.co/KpmodAPQcl
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 14:19:57	@BillyTownsend yes! I know better than reacting, but it's hard! Keep thinking if I say just ONE MORE THING, my point will be taken! LOL
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 14:35:27	@IraSchoffel Worked in Special Ed longer than I'll admit, with so many students like JW. Frustrating,but huge payoff when(and if)it clicks!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 14:37:39	@BillyTownsend And the big question of if Maguire does well, does Jimbo replace with JW in second? I feel for all of them! Crazy situation!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 14:46:00	@Noles850 @PJFNYC Jimbo handled them well. It's all gonna be ok.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 14:50:16	@BillyTownsend Agree, but don't forget we're talking kids here-no excuse, but fact. Gotta keep them ALL motivated to do best. Tuff coach job
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 14:52:02	@BillyTownsend We won't die, but we're not 18-20 yrs old.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 14:54:10	@m4ddy Iphone 6 or 6+?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 14:56:10	@MOTS_3 @Noles850 @PJFNYC Agree! That always makes it harder - when you care! Jimbo and Bobby are both those kinds of coaches-like fathers.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 14:58:12	@BillyTownsend Agree. Just saying sometimes as older, more experienced adults, WE act like kids! (Present company excluded of course!) ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 15:02:07	@HowardTheDoak I made the adult decision to put my fingers in my ears and turn off ESPN till after Clemson goes limping home on Sat nite.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 15:11:57	@TylerCommaJohn Think it's also the old generation gap effect. Old vs young; hard to bridge sometimes.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 15:13:31	@m4ddy Been trying to decide between them.pre-ordered 6, but not sure without seeing them and holding in hand!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 15:19:27	@m4ddy I think the 6 won't be ridiculous, but plus looks huge! #smallpurseprobs
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 15:27:00	@HowardTheDoak @vanillaice AND post on Twitter, FB, and Instagram?!?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 18:42:24	@DavidBVisser only difference today is by now you're prolly taking Prevacid. Never needed as kids! #stomachsofsteel
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 16:25:14	@fsuAndrew50 @BrosOfWarchant wow. I'm done.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 21:47:33	@Harveyrolltide @lowell_todd Not me! Think AU has class, WDE says this Nole fan!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 17:39:42	@ChopChat_ bless his heart! Go Maguire!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 18:48:03	@JJT_ESPNDallas @mikefreemanNFL maybe that's why he's staying at FSU...to grow up???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 19:24:03	@Mr767inc Obviously not yet, ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 19:27:27	@HPNole @RealChrisNulty @DavidHaleESPN Agree, and that saddens me,
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 19:33:59	@hymnforrachel Some athletes "actually make a  difference". Have unique opportunity to lead as we all idolize them 
(Hockey?).
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 19:37:37	@mike_sheridan @nynole55 @anonyMOMous @DavidHaleESPN yes, I get the meme now, but still think he must act as leader representing his school.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 19:18:21	@SamiNole89 and THATS exactly the kind of response I was worried about - not that JW was being malicious,but that idiots would think he was!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 02:33:36	@Timinole Just read that today. Another he said she said.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 02:45:15	@AMFKNole that's what you get at the adult's table. Lol
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 02:47:46	@DeweyKevin I'm wondering about who plays second half if we're WINNING at half?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 02:56:42	@TJ_Pittinger I was at that game / awful night! We were supposed to win, but not so fast my friend...;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 19:40:55	@hymnforrachel which is even bigger opportunity for them to lead &amp; be a good role model. I've liked&amp;defended him from beginning;disappointed
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 19:44:17	@jmnpb996 @TheOneBarrelRum @EricLuallen Sad, as they have perfect opportunity.Also sad about your dad convo. Child parenting parent,
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 03:09:58	@TJ_Pittinger Uesh, the AU fans were brutal...did a "mock chop" cheer in our faces as we crawled out of stadium, tails between our legs. BAD
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 03:17:01	@TJ_Pittinger Husband and I were actually with Steve Bowden at game; taught us all a lesson about over-confidence. #longdrivehome
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 03:20:22	@TomahawkNation Could they have taken it down? Can't get it to open. Maybe just as well after this bad press week.Get mad all over again!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 03:29:58	@TallahasseeJay Gods Country.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 21:09:47	@BrosOfWarchant @KingHarris_9 Thought he admitted it.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 21:11:21	@BrosOfWarchant @KingHarris_9 But you still contend he didn't say it?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 11:37:57	@cdowlar I want to get this, but can't quite figure it out...?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 12:03:16	@cdowlar Ohhhhh, hand egg=football. Duh. It's early=my excuse.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 04:03:34	@SeminoleReverie are they saying it's Stokes decision over Jimbo?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 04:05:18	@ThePHicks13 saying they waited for all of us to be in hotel rooms spending our money before announcing.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 04:06:53	@SeminoleReverie I do t like this st all! Again, administration buckling under media pressure. Did he do anything further??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 04:08:14	@ThePHicks13 very suspicious. Saw some tweet thst TMZ has a video..,hope that is Twitter smack.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 04:10:23	@SeminoleReverie saw some tweet that TMZ has a video??? Hope that's rumor!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 04:12:06	@ThePHicks13 Hate this "non-story" phrase! That's what everyone was saying back on Tuesday-now this!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 04:12:45	@SeminoleReverie saying that's what made aim do full game
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 04:13:16	@SeminoleReverie admin, not aim
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 04:15:49	@SeminoleReverie I know this is a crazy comparison, but just like with logo/Nike deal, they seem to do whatever they please
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 04:35:16	@dreschenendorf And everybody.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 05:03:54	Feinbaum says he would still vote for JW for Heisman. Thx, but no thx.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 05:06:14	@jenolesone I turned to an old movie channel. I just can't with ESPN anymore.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 05:16:59	Jimbo really earning his paycheck this week. Feel bad for him getting stuck between this rock and a hard place.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 13:33:59	Now it's serious. Tomorrow's coffee brings with it...FSU GAME DAY!!! http://t.co/6WfIolpbd7
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 13:41:02	@ThePHicks13 @Noles850 have y'all been to Cantina 101 in College Town? Very Hooteresque. But great food!;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 13:47:39	@ThePHicks13 @Noles850 no no no - FSU College Town - where Madison Social is!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 10:08:46	@saintwarrick That was a really fast night. ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 10:11:02	@NolesAndPhins Do we know what happened to cause the extra half suspension?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 10:12:17	@NolesAndPhins After his apology?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 10:23:54	@jmnpb996 If JW withstands this, it will be a miracle. Rumor on here last night was "more on horizon".
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 10:25:22	@shinny006 yeah, me too. And imagine how little Jimbo got...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 10:34:30	@TheEsquireof212 So, help me. What do you now know that you didn't last night?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 10:36:37	@hymnforrachel announced at 11:10 last night.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 22:59:57	@jenolesone I'm disappointed in his continued lack of awareness, but I like and support him. He's still my QB.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 23:04:18	@LogansTwitty Not to mention embarrassing.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 23:10:47	@TGMowerman @melinasphotos And may be my imagination, but when Jameis was apologizing, I think he was close to tears at one point. Lesson?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 23:14:59	@TGMowerman @melinasphotos that's exactly why I was so concerned about this debacle in first place - for his sake!Protect from himself-tuff!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 23:24:03	@TallyNoleJag32 @TGMowerman @melinasphotos Hopefully.. I've had students like him and it's a full time job. But worth it in end,
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 23:31:06	@jbrading @TheEsquireof212 @KiefOsceola He's not a terrible person. It's hard to conceive that your every action&amp;word makes such difference.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 23:40:36	@KiefOsceola @TheEsquireof212 @Ditti33 Smart man.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 23:43:21	@TGMowerman @jbrading @TheEsquireof212 @KiefOsceola Yes,but the young think they're invincible;maybe sitting out will impress that on him,
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 23:44:28	@Ditti33 @KiefOsceola @TheEsquireof212 Way past time to let this go.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 23:47:22	@Ditti33 @KiefOsceola I get it, but for a "non-story" this is overkill I think. Other news out there more compelling.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 23:49:53	@Ditti33 @KiefOsceola talking about the original act. Obviously FSU thought it was story, dealt with it, let's move on.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 23:54:42	@Ditti33 @KiefOsceola Just saying looks like we have all of story we need. JW did as was asked,FSU refuses to comment further,let kids alone
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 23:55:20	@Ditti33 @KiefOsceola and I mean that respectfully. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 23:56:33	@Ditti33 @KiefOsceola I think this job is finished. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-17 23:59:24	@Ditti33 I have faith. Praying for Jameis - and Sean Maguire! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 00:04:02	@Ditti33 I liked what he said about helping Sean.These are the life lessons to make or break - players and fans alike! Learn&amp;rise 2 occasion
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 00:11:28	@AriyaMassoudi @caseymoore977 don't give away master plan!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 00:18:25	@TylerCommaJohn @TheEsquireof212 @dannykanell True, but agree w/Danny-how much does it take to learn simple lesson. Right or wrong,it's fact
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 00:26:21	@TylerCommaJohn This unfortunate incident may be the catalyst that makes this team one.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 00:28:39	@EricLuallen @DanWolken I just said this incident could be catalyst that makes this team really gel
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 00:31:28	@TGMowerman @jbrading @TheEsquireof212 @KiefOsceola Exactly.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 00:40:25	@TGMowerman @jbrading @TheEsquireof212 @KiefOsceola If Jimbo &amp;team leaders play this right, could be huge teaching moment. #inthistogether
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-18 00:46:29	Proud to say I once did tequila shots with Lenny Kravits in an underground NYC club. Great moment.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 15:05:26	@MadisonSocial @Warchant @ClemsonTom what time is the dunkfest?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-19 15:11:37	@ClemsonTom @MadisonSocial @Warchant Great! Having brunch there at 10:00; will send my sons to get you wet! Good on you for helping Kidz1st!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-20 15:16:50	@TheEsquireof212 Thx for all the insight. I hate that this is such a mess! We thought last year was bad!! Do u think it is over after this?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 01:08:45	@SBNationCFB Jimbo's a good man who learned from the best - Coach Bobby Bowden,
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 01:13:43	@URBABYSDADDY80 Setting the DVR - this weekend wore me out!!! #FSUfanprobs
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 01:16:09	@Sportsgirl917 @Noles247 @V850404 Totally agree!#letemworkletemlive
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 11:11:06	@hodakotb @LennyKravitz I am proud to tell you that I once did tequila shots with Lenny at an underground NYC club.One happy, lucky tourist!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 11:14:02	@shinny006 I sooo feel your pain...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 15:08:56	@jbrading Still amazes me that he's criticized no matter which road he takes. Even on sidelines in sweat pants.Deep hole to dig out of...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 15:12:03	@jbrading I know. He's at a point where he just can't win with the public. Going to have to walk an even straighter line than ever.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 15:15:19	@jbrading Yes, and knowing kids like him before (teacher), it's close to impossible to recover.He needs a 24/7 handler/mentor as Dad said.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 15:18:52	@seminolemendy @TimBrando Msybe it's up to us fans to spread this kind of positive stuff along with the other. Retweet!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 15:39:23	@jasonburns And maybe his head on a pole strategically placed on Langford Green. #GOTatFSU
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-23 00:10:10	@seminolemendy @REALJimTusca @CollegeGameDay And worse yet, say it in their "outside voice"!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-23 00:27:21	@Joey_Galloway Thanks for trying with Finebaum. Appreciate your points, and agree!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 00:06:09	@TKFSU @KirkHerbstreit @Joey_Galloway Amen!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 00:25:52	@AndrewHoyle22 @jbrading Sending this to all my friends - and enemies!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 00:43:48	@PatrikNohe Another case in point even closer to home - FSU's treatment of the winningest coach in college football.Hope JF sticks with us.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 00:48:09	@FSUNOLE21 more than ridiculous. It's scary. $$$$ has turned the game sour.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 11:21:36	@khjones25 Totally agree! I can tell you that my area of Section 37 of Doak was behind Sean 200% throughout whole game!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-23 17:47:48	@KyleLansky16 @shinny006 I hesitate to respond to these inaccuracies re; Jameis, but please research the FACTS!Try Tomahawk Nation archives.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-23 17:50:06	@LogansTwitty Sorry, but may I ask who that is and of what significance?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 01:58:23	@FSUChiefs As I always say"thanks to the Chiefs, we've NEVER lost a half-time!" Great job!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 04:16:05	@sam_ponder Congrats to your sis, &amp; nice to meet you at FSU on Saturday.Agree with most JW remarks:let's hope he will turn the corner now.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 15:00:06	@PhenomeNoles I think he did darn good considering circumstances. Can't imagine there could ever be a more pressure-packed game!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 15:01:11	@LostLettermen Saw this yesterday - love this kid!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 15:04:13	@EricLuallen @craigdmiller Wouldn't it be nice to just have normal post- /pre-game stuff to discuss?? I'm just tired, I guess.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 15:23:50	@TomahawkNation Yes, so refreshing and, unfortunately more and more unique, to get unbiased articles. Thx!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-22 17:45:13	@ricobert1 @jmnpb996 @PhenomeNoles Jimbo and Maguire gave big props to 12th man fans in their post game...we were LOUD -never gave up!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-23 00:04:24	@REALJimTusca @seminolemendy @CollegeGameDay As opposed to enabler, I think Jimbo is treating JW &amp; team with disciplined love-like a father.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-23 00:18:39	@URBABYSDADDY80 PLEASE don't let this go any further;no more talk of losing Jimbo; please! Gonna have to quit Twitter.Stressing me out!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-23 06:04:21	@REALJimTusca @seminolemendy @CollegeGameDay No, it's I who feel sorry for you, but pity is wasted on the ignorant, so I'll just stop here.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-25 08:35:12	@davidraider88 @LuvDemNoles22 Yes! Joined in with our section 37 chant! Loved it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-23 18:03:05	@FSUWill Yellow journalism. Look it up.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-25 13:54:40	@m4ddy @Timinole or crush aspirin in water to a paste and dab on
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-25 14:00:04	@KirkHerbstreit Just wanted to say enjoyed my pic taken at FSU on set with you and the CGD men!  What a thrill! Thanks for reporting facts.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-25 22:34:44	@perrykos @NikhailGogia311 Good read.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 12:55:54	@PhenomeNoles Are we concerned with the source being TMZ? Is it sourced anywhere else, please God??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 12:57:47	@hymnforrachel @coxasaurus Are we suddenly trusting TMZ??? Hope this is all true for JW sake, but TMZ worries me.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 12:58:26	@hymnforrachel @coxasaurus Seriously.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 12:59:53	@hymnforrachel @coxasaurus but the only source for that is TMZ? Has anyone else confirmed/seen the letter?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 13:01:31	@hymnforrachel @coxasaurus didn't know about that tweet. Thx.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 13:04:28	@sneakerseminole @BarrettSallee @AMFKNole And it's no wonder, we all might be feeling a bit of paranoia! How long have we all been in this??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 13:07:34	@TomahawkNation Thank you, TN, for detailed info again. Tried to route naysayer to you just yesterday. Keep up the good reporting/writing!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 13:14:02	@_TomLang @Noles850 Glad they're thinking ahead for his protection.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 13:16:21	@wmdavidcornwell @hymnforrachel Great to hear!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-26 14:14:26	@PhenomeNoles I think it's going to be Lane. Boom!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-26 15:48:07	@TallyNoleJag32 @PhenomeNoles How about all of them stepping up!! I could vote for that - BOOM!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-27 14:34:42	@thenameisframe @drewjjones84 Do this every week!! Please!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-27 14:39:52	@TJ_Pittinger So you don't want us updating you??How bout this-prediction: FSU 42 NCST 14. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-27 14:43:45	@TJ_Pittinger I don't blame you, but we'll miss you! I'm going to party at BW3's to watch, so will DVR @home for later. Your prediction?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-27 14:48:32	@DJCURTI5 Bite your tongue!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-27 14:55:02	@TJ_Pittinger Ok, will rag you tomorrow after you watch. 42-14 ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-27 14:55:56	@DJCURTI5 I will, but will be hoping for best, not looking for worst!;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-27 14:59:30	@TJ_Pittinger ok, then I'll be on your case at end of game. Maybe we'll both be wrong and it'll be 63-0. üôè
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-27 15:02:58	@TJ_Pittinger Me too! GO NOLES!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-27 15:04:46	@DJCURTI5 Mine stays up all year!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-26 01:35:06	@_TomBlock Lucky you!! Jealous me!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-26 20:23:52	@m4ddy @Timinole Good luck!  Hope it turns out OK.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-26 20:26:32	@Jensantijamison @shinny006 That's about it.  Unless you want to swirl in some olive juice and a splash of vermouth.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-26 22:12:35	@ScalmEm Now that's a grill!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-26 22:19:28	@chrishillfsu Nice! Btw, who was the dude in the red and navy outfit/rain hat walking with Jimbo at the end?? Saw him everywhere!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-26 22:24:34	@Timinole prayers coming your way. Think positive!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-26 22:26:19	@chrishillfsu @LuvDemNoles22 he looked so little out of uniform! Would've never guessed!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-26 22:28:34	@davidraider88 Got two buckets for our Friday night crowd last weekend -chicken went fast, but I'll be eating sauce for weeks!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 01:11:45	@TJ_Pittinger Ok, so we were both wrong on our scores. I, for one, cannot figure out our team. But put it in the W column.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 01:12:55	@LogansTwitty I love. God bless Rashad.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 01:14:29	@TJ_Pittinger Absolutely! Even though our predicting skills suck.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 01:16:51	@ricobert1 Done.üôè
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 01:23:42	@danofero14 @93warchant99 it was ridiculous. Why can't they wrap up a tackle?!?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 01:53:06	@CoachLynchFsu @NoleGirl98 You're welcome. Just know I'm running out of years off my life left to give.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 01:56:40	@melinasphotos @espn @SBNationCFB The positive stories have been there all along, just not gotten the coverage like the negative ones.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-27 03:46:28	@pcbeachlaw @crystnadior Glad to know my total exhaustion after the game was worth it !! Actually took me till Tuesday to fully recover! Lol
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-27 04:16:22	@WillieGeist from a rainy night in St. Augustine, Fl- #porchlights4darren http://t.co/N3izMQL2bC
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-27 13:53:08	@Timinole So sorry to hear this outcome. Will continue to keep you and yours in prayer for peace and comfort.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-27 14:26:03	@Timinole For women, hair dye; men just look more distinguished. #doublestandard ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-27 14:33:20	@CollegeGameDay @Susie487 Obviously, FSU / NCST !!! Where is that on your list?!?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 05:03:41	@ChopChat_ Again, proud to say, that's my QB!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 05:18:51	@idontwan2know And reading Jimbo's lips on the sideline to JAmeis was fun though.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 05:23:51	@TheOneBarrelRum This pic looks about right based on the attitudes of the OSU fans in the sports bar next to me today. Yup. 'Bout right.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 05:26:29	@TheOneBarrelRum Lol. And that's in good old English. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 05:28:17	@ClemonsDexter @RickeySmiley @ESPNCFB Yes, isn't that the way it works? One play is all it takes.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 05:30:38	@TheOneBarrelRum "Because college" being the keys here.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 05:39:28	@cblunt58 Look at big picture. Can't look at just errors without looking at the good stuff at same time. Life lesson.;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 05:40:44	@TheOneBarrelRum Most fun stuff usually isn't. That's why college only lasts four years-we couldn't survive more fun than that.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 05:44:40	@TheEsquireof212 One game at a time. One. Game. Period.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 05:48:53	@KirkHerbstreit thanks for hanging in there with FSU. #stillunconquered
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 05:49:53	@TheOneBarrelRum Hang in there. Monday's coming.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 05:52:18	@NoleFan06 @NoleGirl98 if anything, ESPN is what "went wrong with Florida State"! Just let us play.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 05:53:30	@TheOneBarrelRum Try sleep instead. You can start again tomorrow.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 05:55:16	@DrewGHowell At least you're not at OSU, but watch your back just in case.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 06:07:30	@TheEsquireof212 Maybe I'll just wait for these highlights from now on. And skip the scary full game stuff.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 06:25:49	@TheEsquireof212 Yeah, you're right, but I would look a lot younger. Life is full of trade-offs I guess.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 06:27:34	@idontwan2know Now that's a JW prob I can live with. Headline weak.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 06:28:48	@TheEsquireof212 me too! And by end of this season...Welp, won't be a pretty picture...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 14:16:39	@KilroyFSU And we already know what ESPN thinks over, and over, and over...ad nauseum. With emphasis on the nausea part.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 14:20:30	@shinny006 Wish I could remember 35...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 14:31:45	@SeminoleReverie NOW I see why we had such a wild game!! Should've worn that shirt under your wedding attire!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 19:38:08	@perrykos Had the BLT on Sunday after game. delish! New restaurant for me-loved it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-24 19:40:38	@iamcrzymom @espn or outhouses.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 14:38:11	@Timinole Finally figured out the PayPal deal...couldn't send much, but hope it helps. Condolences and prayers to you and to your family.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 15:15:06	@EricLuallen Did u hear the announcers at game? They were out of control over this -still hard to understand how it was missed by sidelines
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 15:19:33	@osfsu Good news since IWCTM30T! (It Was Crazy To Miss 30 Tackles!)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 19:34:15	@TomahawkNation I'd say he claims this based on what HE would do, or more likely, what he HAS done. #poorsportatbest
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 20:53:06	@slmandel @KilroyFSU @ZacEllis @LarsAnderson71 I disagree with this article! Perhaps you should ask larger cross section? To be fair to all?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 23:11:48	@EricLuallen @BobFerrante Seemed like 130.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 23:26:06	@KirkHerbstreit Yes. Yes. And yes.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 23:35:24	@LogansTwitty Put a #5 jersey on it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 00:00:57	@KirkHerbstreit FSU!! Why would that not be true? Always worked for Bama!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 00:02:29	@OneFLDynasty @KirkHerbstreit And it always worked for Bama!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 00:05:30	Just found my kids can't go this weekend, so have 4 SW corner end zone tix for FSU/Wake game. Would like to sell @ face value. Pls DM me.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 00:24:31	@LostLettermen With all that is known about him,what is the compelling reason to keep him, is my question??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 00:30:05	@LostLettermen @KirkHerbstreit Would so hope that team win/loss record would have nothing to do with safety/health of player.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 00:31:40	@LostLettermen Even if safety/health of players in jeopardy? Would pull my son from program immediately.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 00:33:22	@LostLettermen I would think not!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 01:10:54	@MOTS_3 Pun? Blinds? ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 01:19:32	Wonder if the two NOLE centers feel a little bit at home when they hear the chop tonight. (weak as it is)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 01:39:35	@ScalmEm @NolesAndPhins She can see them in their corral under the stands before game. Don't know about in full regalia and on field.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 01:42:24	@NolesAndPhins @ScalmEm under north end zone. Also can take pic with Chief Osceola. My daughter and kids loved it! http://t.co/1s3O6RqY1Q
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 01:45:38	@NolesAndPhins @ScalmEm Might not let her that close to Renegade, but can see them from about 4    ft away for pic. Get there early ( line).
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 01:47:32	@NolesAndPhins @ScalmEm Go in gate across from sod cemetery and turn right.Can't remember gate letter.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 01:50:54	@ScalmEm @NolesAndPhins Thx! You're right!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-30 01:52:19	@NolesAndPhins @ScalmEm Have fun!!

302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 16:41:57	@TallahasseeJay But they're Bama.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 18:12:18	@PatrikNohe Starting?? You mean, continuing...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 18:12:58	@Moojenowski Men. So typical. :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 18:16:11	@Jmacfsu24 @SamiNole89 @JTWells4 Here was ours at the FSU/Clem tailgate in Tally...yum! http://t.co/jSeXZsp0LO
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 18:19:01	@Jmacfsu24 @SamiNole89 @JTWells4 My son-in/law's from Alaska and he knows how to cook seafood-especially King crab legs!! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-28 18:20:29	@SamiNole89 @Jmacfsu24 @JTWells4 No, sorry, he's one of a kind! And glad to say all ours!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 01:42:10	@TallyNoleJag32 Save me a seat!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 01:46:54	@TallyNoleJag32 Me too! Maybe that's what the new "fan zones" at Doak will look like (minus the ocean). ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 01:50:42	@TallyNoleJag32 Too bad I won't be able to afford that either tho
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 01:52:30	@TallyNoleJag32 yes, my football obsession is breaking me...but so fun!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 01:54:56	@TallyNoleJag32 Oh, wow! You are serious! Takes me till Tuesday to recover without going to Everbank on Sunday! 12 hrs of tailgating kills!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 01:57:59	@TallyNoleJag32 yes, not kidding about Tuesday recovery. I was whipped!! Also so hot - is it going to be any cooler this weekend?? 3:30 ugh
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 02:00:23	@TallyNoleJag32 Dang. Ready for some fall weather! Oh, well - will "take one for the team"...lol
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 02:01:08	@TallyNoleJag32 ooohhh!!! That's much better! Sweater weather for us Floridians!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 02:02:00	@TallyNoleJag32 Much better!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 02:03:02	@DJCURTI5 AND now he's babysitting Jameis, thank God!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 02:04:20	@TallyNoleJag32 Glad it will be nice for parents' weekend. Gotta keep them happy!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 02:06:51	@DJCURTI5 Actually sent this plus games, candy and books today. Hope he gets it before the game. http://t.co/w8mLtKja0V
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 02:08:25	@TallyNoleJag32 Yep- what time is UF/Tenn? Would love to be singing Old Rockytop at the end of that one...;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 02:10:09	@DJCURTI5 Hope so...poor little guy!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 02:15:58	@Flanneryanne @MadisonSocial heard a fan say after Clemson that when aliens come to take over the world, THIS is where we'll make last stand
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 03:09:21	Still have 4 end zone seats for FSU/Wake available for sale. DM me if interested. Go NOLES!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 05:48:21	@DJCURTI5 @SodTalk What time?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-01 06:04:02	@Lovekenzie13Amy @DJCURTI5 @ThePHicks13 Happy to help. How do you know family?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 00:09:16	@JTWells4 @SamiNole89 @Jmacfsu24 Thank you! Love tailgating for my NOLES!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 00:12:14	Just got home from a Corn Hole Tourney, and happy I missed the first half replay! Will enjoy this ending again!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-02 01:11:49	@PatrikNohe Uh, yeah...can you say corruption???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-02 01:20:21	@jbrading No extras for ND, but how about 4 for Wake??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-02 01:22:36	@jbrading but it's Tally, and Doak, and your team, and fun, and tailgating, and Madison Social, and you know, live football!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-02 01:24:38	@jbrading Come on, it's only $$$$$$$!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-02 01:25:57	@jbrading I feel your pain...;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-02 01:58:24	@pcbeachlaw Great video - sent it to my daughter who was a Chief! ‚ù§Ô∏è it!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-02 03:28:23	@SeatGeekNCAA You are truly over concerned about me paying too much for UF or UM tickets. Trust me, it is NOT a problem. Not even close.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-02 03:44:07	@nolanolegal sounds very scary. Very.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-02 03:48:34	@FSUnoleSC @bradleySFR @FSUChiefs me too! They are the best!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 12:58:22	@JOENOLES @ThePHicks13 I am near G'ville if I can do anything.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 13:08:50	@ThePHicks13 @JOENOLES Absolutely. Just don't want to intrude as stranger.do you know anything about length of stay?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 13:28:20	@floridastate @MeganBoone @fsuzeigler Love that show and she's great in it! Go Noles!!#blacklist
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 13:55:58	@Timinole @nolanolegal Just saw the tail end of this...is it too late to contribute?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 13:58:21	@MOTS_3 Yep! Another of our success stories. Think she's from Ocala area?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 14:42:11	@PhenomeNoles @danofero14 @TJ_Pittinger Geez. Got any GOOD news??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 14:43:46	@TheOneBarrelRum Just wanted to say, glad you made it to Monday! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 14:47:25	@TJ_Pittinger It's what family does for one another. #NoleNation
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 21:04:34	@m4ddy This is so funny! I can totally relate...;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 21:06:52	@m4ddy Yes, indeed. But sometimes those old pix - who ARE those girls??? Lol
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 21:12:27	@ESPNCFB @hymnforrachel Hope he's enjoying those sour grapes.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-09-29 21:39:47	@KilroyFSU @PhenomeNoles @DavidHaleESPN @LarryWilliamsTI Ha! Love this!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 01:32:18	@Natalie_Pierre I don't know what happened to make you resign, but I do know you will be greatly missed! Your stories always had heart. ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 03:43:02	@DRusso97 pretty sure they are angels, not ducks
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 03:45:16	@DRusso97 ha!! Very true. Maybe fallen angels?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 03:48:43	@FSUNOLE21 looks like that is a big "if" right now. #fingerscrossed
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 03:52:01	@Noles850 @FSUNOLE21 Funny how that works ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 03:57:05	@TheEsquireof212 "colossal blunder."
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 03:58:57	@TheOneBarrelRum Time. To. Start. Drinking.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 04:01:56	@TheOneBarrelRum OK. Saving your tweet. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 04:04:22	@Noles850 @Warchant Not to mention ESPN's concerns about our ratings, our QB, our coach, and of course us idiot fans.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-04 00:07:44	@saintwarrick what game is on??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-04 00:08:24	@saintwarrick Thx - what time is ND tomorrow??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-04 00:10:28	@shinny006 oh, Lordy - didn't get past third word...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-04 01:41:45	@saintwarrick what is score?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-04 01:42:59	@saintwarrick sounds a little odd...?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-04 01:44:34	@Timinole @cblunt58 but glad you're there.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-04 19:14:50	Gorgeous day at Doak! http://t.co/Hn3qrjZrEF
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-04 14:20:44	My good luck jewelry for today. http://t.co/e3eQgHFHAm
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-04 14:23:59	@shinny006 Thx - and when it works today (as it surely will) - I'll wear it for rest of season! #gonoles
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 10:56:00	@DRusso97 So the duck angels really DID fall! What a great wake up for me!!woohoo!!!! Bet ESPN is NOT happy!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 11:05:18	@ESPNCFB Soooo maybe Ducks aren't as good as you kept saying???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-04 14:53:36	@TomahawkNation "Nine in, nine out." #goodfam
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-04 16:37:20	@Lovekenzie13Amy So happy it came by Game Day!  Go Jerred and Go NOLES!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 15:13:58	@IraSchoffel @TomahawkNation Can you say "crucifixion"??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 15:23:46	@melinasphotos My daughter was a Chief, and I have always stayed for the Hymn. Beautiful!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 15:25:51	@WJHG_TV @Noles850 What's ETA for Tallahassee? Probably as soon as I enter city limits. :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 15:32:02	@lowell_todd @DRusso97 @gergsport @TheEsquireof212 You realize you've already had about 200 hits on this?! Haha
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 15:35:17	@AMFKNole I think there's a bunch of us with our ducks in a row today...but wanna remember not to count our chickens yet. Fowl!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 15:36:21	@stpete2you @lowell_todd @DRusso97 @gergsport @TheEsquireof212 Bless JW's heart - can't help he grew up in Bama.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 15:38:02	@lowell_todd @stpete2you @DRusso97 @gergsport @TheEsquireof212 Yes! And I understand every word he says!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 15:39:32	@lowell_todd @stpete2you @DRusso97 @gergsport @TheEsquireof212 I have always said takes more smarts to pull off street vernacular anyway.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 15:43:14	@lowell_todd @stpete2you @DRusso97 @gergsport @TheEsquireof212 Amen! And you can bet the well-spoken Mariota would trade for in heartbeat
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 15:45:47	@lowell_todd @stpete2you @DRusso97 @gergsport @TheEsquireof212 Saw the writing on the (Twitter) wall!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-04 23:59:37	@stpete2you Typical, but a win is a win! 21 in a row!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 00:01:57	@stpete2you and we did it without Rashad in second half. Is he ok?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 00:05:13	@stpete2you me too! Love that kid!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 00:52:38	@NoSleepCapital @Moojenowski Looks like it to me. Go Dad!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 16:33:09	@TheEsquireof212 @lowell_todd @stpete2you @DRusso97 @gergsport Yep. English teacher here. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 16:34:55	@TheEsquireof212 @lowell_todd @stpete2you @DRusso97 @gergsport And combine all this with his love of being class clown, gives full picture.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-03 16:36:15	@TheEsquireof212 @lowell_todd @stpete2you @DRusso97 @gergsport Have had too many like him over the years...some are now CO's, politicians.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 01:02:28	@TomahawkNation Typical SEC logic- no surprise here.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 01:17:12	@Sportsgirl917 what did he say now?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 01:20:31	Are the UM players really wearing black dress socks with those adorable unis???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 01:34:00	@Sportsgirl917 well he does have a criminal record you know...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 02:09:59	@ScottJDonahoe Great losses and a mediocre win.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-04 17:46:25	Watching Florida lose @MadisonSocial http://t.co/WuXVITgxm2
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 06:33:39	@King_moore65 @SamiNole89 Tears all over Section 37, I can tell you!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 07:04:30	@cblunt58 FSU just keep on clawing way thru mire while rest of the pack fights it out all around us. Clever game plan...one at a time.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 07:07:40	@AMFKNole Sure there is but, Please God, no!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 18:09:24	@JTWells4 @SirSeminole95 Welp. Guess I should make it clear that I don't want him in Tally. Need to send a note to Jimbo i reckon.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 18:10:36	Driving back from Tally - what Sirius channel has Jags game?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 18:12:55	@JTWells4 @SirSeminole95 And that WOULD b crazy!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 18:15:34	@SFLHOV @seminole4life22 just because we're good, and not SEC. Cuz SEC is everything to everybody everywhere always and forever.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 18:16:12	@JTWells4 @SirSeminole95 Now that is a spin I hadn't thought of...hmmm
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 18:35:06	@ChopChat_ Surely agreed with Nohe's "fun" article. Good lessons for us fans!! Go Noles!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 17:34:52	@dtackett_ Geez! What's with all the injuries?? Had zero last year!!! (another comparison ICYMI!)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 17:45:25	@WayneMcGaheeIII @danofero14 Please read Nohe's article for Chopchat regarding no fun anymore for FSU. Gotta move forward and leave last yr!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 17:49:26	@AriyaMassoudi I keep referring folks to @PatrikNohe's article on "No More fun..." Such good lessons for ALL of us!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 17:52:05	@ClemsonTom @SirSeminole95 I want to react to this in defense of women, but, sadly, not sure I can...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 17:54:47	@TheEsquireof212 you mean about their QB??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 18:30:13	@TheEsquireof212 Gotcha. Of course they would do that. Doesn't surprise me in the least. We need to take high road and stay out of it. IMO
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 18:31:40	@SeminoleReverie @missdaiana @m4ddy What now??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 18:33:50	@Corey_Clark @saintwarrick Long day for writers - and tailgating fans! When will we know about CHD?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 22:46:15	Can anyone tell me if/when the FSU/wake game will be replayed on a Dish network??? Cuz Dish can't tell me anything!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 00:44:39	@TheOneBarrelRum is FSU on anywhere??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 00:52:54	@TheOneBarrelRum Nah, I get it. Mixed bag. Used to show replay on sunsports channel - did SEC network take that away??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 00:56:49	@TheOneBarrelRum @_TomBlock That IS irritating. Why do I always feel like FSU has to settle for the crumbs?(and I'm not talking Jimbo's)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 21:03:35	@TJ_Pittinger @TheBobbyBowden @CollegeGameDay He may not be as wild as KP, but he would bring a little class to that ESPN SHOW! Got my vote!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-07 01:37:24	@AMFKNole What I admire is his kicks look so effortless. It's def a thing of beauty.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 01:25:51	@_TomBlock @TheOneBarrelRum So what happened?! And are you telling me there will be no more replays of our games??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 01:33:16	@_TomBlock @TheOneBarrelRum That long? I feel like I was seeing them last season. Am I nuts?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 01:37:34	@_TomBlock @TheOneBarrelRum Well, good grief. Miss it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 01:39:45	@_TomBlock I wondered about that...those are things Rashad could easily read. Do we know how he is doing? How severe was concussion?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 01:43:26	@jenolesone are you watching it on a channel or your own recording?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 17:43:50	@SirSeminole95 Stop. That. Foolishness.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-05 18:00:54	@JTWells4 @SirSeminole95 I know, I know...but surely he wouldn't want to come to FSU!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 01:53:29	@jenolesone I have to start doing that! Used to replay them all on regular Tv channel, but not any more!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-07 11:48:26	@SachsMediaGrp @Sauteeman @floridastate Morecars than people! Ha!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-07 12:14:02	@jimmyfallon Ew! Was hilarious!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-07 12:44:11	@TJ_Pittinger Most NOLES seem to be reserving comments since no one did that for JW.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-07 12:54:12	@MOTS_3 @TJ_Pittinger Agree. But many are taking high road. Personally feel UF should've withheld suspension until proof;hope they know more
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-07 12:58:16	@jimmyfallon @iamwill I loved "Ew!" But would love to see you do a serious musical video...soooo talented!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-07 13:01:26	@MOTS_3 @TJ_Pittinger as a woman and mother of daughters.I totally get the whole rape issue, but also see the boy's rights too.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 12:35:57	@m4ddy I cannot see how the committee can ever make an unbiased decision. #alreadymissingBCS
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 12:44:23	@hymnforrachel and always have them check your spare. Mine kept coming on and tire check always fine; finally it was spare which was low
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-06 12:52:08	@DevinFSU And more importantly just hope he is ok regardless of when he can play again!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-08 02:09:43	@DJCURTI5 @KShaw81 Proud to be a part of Nole Nation! Thanks, Kenny!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-08 02:11:57	@ThePHicks13 @DJCURTI5 @NoleLover32 Glad to hear he is doing well!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-08 02:14:02	@TheEsquireof212 @NolesAndPhins met her in Dallas backstage at an event.Shes hanging in there!Popular with the old football crew. Very nice.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-08 02:17:02	@TomahawkNation @Noles850 He is just adorable! Like a 6 year old on Christmas morning.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-08 02:31:00	@TheEsquireof212 @NolesAndPhins So was she on TV tonight or something??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-08 02:43:57	@TheEsquireof212 @NolesAndPhins I did not know all that ! Will have to watch when they replay.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-08 02:45:50	@TheEsquireof212 @NolesAndPhins got it.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-09 14:04:45	@Jmacfsu24 @SamiNole89 Done!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-09 14:09:21	@BleedGarnetGold Honestly? Both. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-09 14:30:10	@Jmacfsu24 @SamiNole89 That's what family is for! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-09 14:34:55	@DeweyKevin @jbrading @SportsTalkFLA Sooo glad I have season tix - great games at DOAK!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 02:06:47	@_TomBlock You're good at finding that "right plane". ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 02:30:29	@Tim_Linafelt Been off Twitter all day and just saw this great news! Congratulations from a fan of your writing!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 02:42:15	@NoleLover32 Nice!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 21:20:38	@DJCURTI5 @Lovekenzie13Amy @NoleLover32 @ThePHicks13 Big families are the best! Glad we could help a little!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 21:23:01	@Atlanta_Nole @Noles850 This mess is really getting old.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 23:05:55	@Lovekenzie13Amy @DJCURTI5 @NoleLover32 @ThePHicks13 What's the latest report on JJ?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 23:13:51	@EricLuallen @AlligatorArmy I always try to err on side of caution when dealing with kids' lives. No safety concerns existed for victim...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 23:15:17	@EricLuallen @AlligatorArmy cont...just fear of reprimand, bad PR for UF. Neither students' rights/safety were at the forefront.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 23:25:01	@Lovekenzie13Amy @DJCURTI5 He is young and obviously strong with loads of positive support from family and friends. Prayers will be answered
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 03:19:29	@_TomBlock ;) and the only one with good decor!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 03:25:42	@SBNation A little entrapment???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-09 14:37:04	@DeweyKevin @jbrading @SportsTalkFLA I bought 4 tix for my kids on FSU payment plan-definitely a good deal. Stretches out payments, no int!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-09 14:39:15	@DeweyKevin @jbrading @SportsTalkFLA yes! Check it out for next season - with ND game going for $250/tic, it's well worth it!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-09 14:42:17	@DeweyKevin @jbrading @SportsTalkFLA exactly! Can get into end zone for just $60 booster plus about $300 for season ticket. Deal!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 23:38:24	@Noles247 @PhenomeNoles Such a weak argument 247. Surprised at your stance.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 23:48:22	@born2chop @PhenomeNoles @Dick_Egan I hope he stays through Grad School and we make them all suffer!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 23:51:11	@ThePHicks13 @NoleLover32 awesome! Why can't we all talk about this on FOX SPORTS???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 23:52:48	@cblunt58 yes. Do.not,go. #dontwasteyourtime
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 23:54:15	@nolanolegal @TallahasseeJay Hope JW can ignore it all one more time until next time.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 23:54:45	@ThePHicks13 @NoleLover32 Sooooo irritating!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 23:56:17	@Dick_Egan @PhenomeNoles now THERE's an idea! Best one I've heard all day!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 00:44:52	@HeatherSnedeker @hymnforrachel I like this. A lot.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 01:39:03	@Natalie_Pierre I'm having a hard time following this...maybe I came in too late...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 01:42:35	@Natalie_Pierre Doing that now cuz I usually agree with you...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 01:47:30	@Natalie_Pierre Instead of sensationalizing it as if new hard evidence had surfaced?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 12:54:38	@Puntrooskie @DJCURTI5 Saw this happen and it was awesome. Love the comparison!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 14:24:31	@osfsu Sooooo what's your take on this??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 14:26:30	@VALadyNole Good Lord. Can't people find something else to talk about?? Leave my QB alone!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 02:41:14	@nolanolegal I'm thinking I now hate Twitter. Think I was happier in my ignorance BT (Before Twitter).
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 02:43:51	@PhenomeNoles Really making Bud and TN earn their $$ since we met JW.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 02:45:33	@nolanolegal What is Monks position in all this?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 02:46:38	@Timinole yeah, I was going to suggest Fox Sports.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 02:48:53	@NolesAndPhins ESPN just said JW to face student code of conduct hearing.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 02:51:05	@NolesAndPhins surely they won't do another Friday night panic decision. We already knew about hearing didn't we?? Think Franklin's only 1
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 03:00:19	@NolesAndPhins not sure who/why decided not to do so. I really can't keep up -it's a full time job! Ask TN. He'll know.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 03:05:39	@m4ddy @ShaneArrington1 @Terence_Huie It's a two-rutted dirt road running aimlessly  through the weeds of despair and fortitude.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 03:11:43	@Josh_Hubert @fsunelson @nytimes @FOXSports @espn We bleed garnet and gold-not because we are blindly loyal,but because we love truth.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 03:14:01	@davidraider88 yeah, no ex-CUSE.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 03:23:13	@TylerCommaJohn I so hope you're wrong , but then I saw what they did to Bobby Bowden...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 03:28:21	@NolesJags904 But unfortunately they insist on holding JW to a higher standard.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 03:32:32	@cblunt58 @VALadyNole Now, ya see, this is a bad part of Twitter.Everybod feeds off of each other and it gets CRAZY-should be called Frenzy!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 03:38:34	@fsusean83 @SamiNole89 Those of us who are alums welcome all who love FSU! #NoleNation
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 13:31:50	@PhenomeNoles @nolanolegal Soooo in the light of day, are things better, worse for JW than last night???(hoping for a small ray of light)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 13:38:00	@FSUNOLE21 @PhenomeNoles If FSU can throw Bobby Bowden under the bus, what do you think they'll do to JW? Only save him for Dallas maybe.;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 13:44:16	@EricLuallen I actually remember when I used to look forward to CGD on Saturday morning. Sad nostalgia. ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 13:47:31	@LogansTwitty Who is it??? Share! Spanx girl?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-11 14:06:06	@EricLuallen @m4ddy Told yall. Lol
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 18:12:51	@TheEsquireof212 Me too! Years ago in car accident - but I can predict weather now better than most meteorologists.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-10 00:50:51	@NoSleepCapital What's going on up there??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 00:38:07	@AschoffESPN @PlayoffFootball @davidpollack47 Only emotion I saw was a snarl from Saban to Kiffin on sidelines.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 01:14:01	@gonolesglp its a tough call as to who is the worst.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 01:19:23	@jbrading @Jeff_LJ_Lloyd @VincentFrankNFL Class of '04 I think.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 01:55:19	@jenolesone Whats the score?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 01:56:45	@FSURich are gators on TV?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 02:10:12	@FSURich ugh. Ok thx.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 02:24:27	Mushberger just loves the Gators. So unbiased and professional.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 02:26:39	@khjones25 I used to like him, but he has been body snatched by SEC.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 02:46:32	@MojoFishing @khjones25 Now he's happy again. LSU is killin' me. And I really don't even like LSU.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 02:50:13	@melinasphotos And almost totally forgetting about the dark cloud on the horizon. ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 03:20:21	And again I say, it's really hard to listen to a commentator named Booger, or Boog, as they call him when they're running out of time. #EW!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 03:43:41	@FSUNOLE21 c'm on man! It's always fun when Gators lose. Always. Granted it's more fun when they're worth a damn. But still: an L is an L!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 03:45:50	@FSUNOLE21 You meant to say it's MORE fun. I know you did. You're just tired. Go to bed. Everything will be better in the morning. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 03:50:29	@FSUNOLE21 Ya see, THAT'S what sets us apart from our reptilian neighbors. We're nice. Empathetic even. I applaud you.But still glad of L;-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 05:57:57	@perrykos who won in Arizona game?I fell asleep.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 06:05:51	@Seminolessss Will def make us look the Criminoles vs the Catholics.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 06:39:03	@saintwarrick He's trying to make up. Don't let him in. Too late.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 06:40:16	@TheEsquireof212 Don't trust him. He's just being Lou's devil advocate.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 06:41:58	@TheEsquireof212 And I don't forgive his attacks on JW so easily. Snake.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 06:45:15	@TheEsquireof212 Exactly. Got caught with his hand in the cookie jar. Eddie Haskell.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 06:48:17	@TheEsquireof212 And Lou Holtz needs a new tune. Tired of his constant ND bias. Idiot statement about playing away from home being better.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 06:56:00	@TheEsquireof212 Well, he's sending me to bed! I'm done!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 06:58:36	@TheEsquireof212 good luck and good night! We'll live to fight another day!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 10:39:49	@SBNation I'd say honeymoon's over.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 10:41:24	@IraSchoffel Random question: was it hot in the Cartier Dome cuz no AC?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 13:18:18	@IraSchoffel of course, meant CARRIER Dome, and WHY would an AC company sponsored covered stadium not have air?!But another notch in belt!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 13:20:32	@born2chop In their faces!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 13:22:09	@AMFKNole On the other hand, maybe they just need the challenge to perform.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 13:36:14	Watching JW discussion on ESPN - will NO ONE speak up on this young man's defense?To at least remind that he has NOT been charged/convicted?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 14:29:29	@PJFNYC @DeweyKevin @nytimes @KevinTigue @TomahawkNation "formerly" instead of 'formally' only error I see. Otherwise TOTALLY agree!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 14:47:13	@rachbarnhart @nolanolegal @JudithShulevitz Excellent article! Thx for sharing!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 15:26:15	@GatorZoneFB @nolanolegal Great news - from an FSU fan. It was scary, and so glad he is ok!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 15:30:51	@SirSeminole95 @KirkHerbstreit @bradze Don't understand why "this year" makes that policy suddenly obsolete???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 15:33:13	@EricLuallen @cdowlar Explain to me why SOS can be considered so much when school/team has no control over that for season? Unfair.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 15:37:16	@FSUNOLE21 @KirkHerbstreit @bradze Yes, again I ask, what makes the no-loss policy any different for "this year"? If 1a,1b-then Y not 1c???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 15:41:36	@celebrityhottub @TylerCommaJohn Not sure who you are, but I'm following! You're so damn funny!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-13 00:02:17	@HeatherSnedeker @pcbeachlaw @CStephMM Anyone who thinks JW doesn't care about his team has not watched him play or pace sideline in sweats.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-13 00:09:16	@MojoFishing @HeatherSnedeker @pcbeachlaw @CStephMM Agree, but Tenow aside,JW may have his faults, but not caring about his team is NOT one!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-13 00:09:27	@MojoFishing @HeatherSnedeker @pcbeachlaw @CStephMM Tebow
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 17:04:31	@FlaStateGameday Now if we could just get him to speak up in JW's defense...too much to ask??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 17:08:24	@KirkHerbstreit Kirk, simply 'cause right is right.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-13 09:21:10	@jmnpb996 Will make coming home to the States even better, yes?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-13 11:15:47	@tomdangelo44 @canfish16 Great to see my all-time favorite golfer in full FSU gear!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-13 01:22:51	OMG -WD!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-13 01:23:33	@edsbs @nycsouthpaw @TheRealWBTC is this real???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-13 01:24:43	@davidraider88 Agree!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-13 01:32:40	@EliPerl @hymnforrachel Get it, Carol!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-13 01:36:06	@WalkingDead_AMC @crystnadior All I know is Carol is a bad ass! New respect!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-13 01:42:46	@crystnadior @WalkingDead_AMC this kid choking the baby is gonna get his bad!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-13 01:43:05	@crystnadior @WalkingDead_AMC can't believe I watch this!!!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-13 01:45:08	@crystnadior He is dinner now.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 14:01:57	@TallyNoleJag32 @FSUeyedoc Huess they have to enjoy it while they can. Collectors items.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 14:49:30	@Andy_Staples You were more than right. And 100 pts doesn't seem like enough. Puts things in perspective for sure. Thx for sharing.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 18:53:42	@crystnadior He goes to restaurants just like us normal folks! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-12 18:59:48	@crystnadior Good! Altho part of me wishes they had given him a standing ovation or something!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 17:56:29	@coachowen15 @EricLuallen Nuff said. Cowherd is such a mouth - am sure his replacement is same or worse.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 18:02:07	@TimBrewster That's what I like to hear!! Go NOLES!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 18:06:23	@DJCURTI5 You know what I'm thinking don't you?? Do I have to say #BlameJameis ???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 18:07:16	@JT_Nole Why isn't he being attacked and vilified instead of JW??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 18:11:33	@JT_Nole And by "he" I meant the autograph guy, not Edwards.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 18:13:08	@JT_Nole ;) just didn't want to leave question - there's too much junk out there already. Is it Saturday yet???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 18:19:08	@NolesVikesMavs @BryceStrand I think the question really is "What if the author of this dumbass article is mentally ill?"
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 18:25:41	@FSUnWoWarrior I say Lot 14 has you beat!! http://t.co/URnLlfcgs1
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 18:31:55	@DJCURTI5 ;) Wonder if JW is aware of his name being tweeted like 5000 times for mock blame?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 18:49:03	@TallahasseeJay And POSITIVE Jameis/Jimbo signs!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 21:25:56	@JOENOLES @USATODAY Love it! Go JOENOLES!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 22:20:47	@hymnforrachel I need a bench like that for my master! Pretty room!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 22:35:53	@ThePHicks13 Just saw this - great news! So happy for him and the whole family! Go JJ!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 22:38:46	@ThePHicks13 @NoleLover32 @VALadyNole @canfish16 @DJCURTI5 So glad to hear and happy to be on Team JJ!! Best L'il Seminole, like Fisher sons
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 22:49:31	@KirkHerbstreit I have respected YOUR reporting, but the ESPN bias is real.Read these texts and tell me whose side do you want to be on ?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 22:59:46	@nole4life99 @Susie487 I font even care about the Championship anymore, just want them to leave Jameis alone!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 23:00:02	@nole4life99 @Susie487 *don't
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 23:03:23	@Susie487 oh, believe me, I would love it, but not sure anything will shut them up. They will want it revoked if he plays and we win. Sad.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 23:06:00	@Grr8Scott don't watch.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 00:08:22	@themikegreen54 @KirkHerbstreit Kirk, this is why we're feeling a little "radical". Riding above is getting exhausting. ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 00:10:40	@themikegreen54 @KirkHerbstreit and very vile. Scary. I'm truly frightened for Jimbo and Jameis. Such hatred.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 00:16:49	@themikegreen54 @KirkHerbstreit He just can't win. No matter what he does / dresses out to help team on sidelines=no; Graphs/pix w/fans=no!?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 00:19:20	@themikegreen54 @TallyNoleJag32 @KirkHerbstreit At the end of the day, I trust Jimbo, therefore I trust Jameis. Praying for both.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 00:26:37	@themikegreen54 @KirkHerbstreit Just don't think Kirk realizes the level of hatred out there for JW&amp;FSU. Makes me sad-FSU IS my alma mater.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 00:29:28	@NateGreer26 been meaning to ask - what does GOAT mean??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 00:30:50	@NateGreer26 love it. And yes it would be.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 00:33:34	@drewjjones84 I feel your pain. Prolly a lot more than you know.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 00:41:43	@dn3524 @jenolesone @darrenrovell So now we are not only pre-determining guilt, but affirming that we need no proof? Is this still America??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 00:45:43	@bradleySFR @seminolemendy Don't let them steal your joy.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 00:47:57	@Warchant @FSUeyedoc why can't people believe that not everyone lies?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 03:07:58	Twitter mobile account has been down since the latest allegation.  #BlameJameis
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 01:42:59	@FSUeyedoc @Warchant Then remind me again about the upside of Twitter...?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 01:45:44	@Jonathan_DeMott @ABSFSU1 yeah, and mines from an older year...that ok??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 01:50:13	@BBassett33 @tpnolefan1 @KirkHerbstreit I was certainly not attacking, just trying to explain to him the bias we see. And Not from him.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 07:22:11	http://t.co/49ajx9hr5g a good article written 4 years ago about JSA. #DontBlameJameis
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 11:17:16	@LogansTwitty Please be specific as to weather relation to your text. I can't take much more. :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 11:22:52	@LogansTwitty @WCTVMike Thx! Was pretty sure that was your reference - just checking on about the 6th shoe dropping...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 11:39:15	@ThePHicks13 @shinny006 @ShaneArrington1 I'm beginning to think we should all shut down for rest of week. Going to be crazy by Saturday!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 11:40:59	@shinny006 I think we're all trying to laugh through the tears!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 11:43:21	@ThePHicks13 @shinny006 @ShaneArrington1 I've just stopped reading anyone of opposite opinion.Impossible responding to them w/out stupidity
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 11:47:09	@ThePHicks13 @shinny006 @ShaneArrington1 Ha! Pretty sure I said that exact thing about a month ago over an earlier JW issue.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 11:49:20	@TallyNoleJag32 @ThePHicks13 @shinny006 @ShaneArrington1 Like someone's idea of making about 500 CGD signs reporting GOOD things JW has done
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 11:53:44	@ThePHicks13 Sorry! I would've had your back but Twitter access on cell was down, and yes, I already posted that I did #BlameJameis!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 11:57:19	@TallyNoleJag32 @ThePHicks13 @shinny006 @ShaneArrington1 Yes. better than boycotting CGD, instead use them for some GOOD JAMEIS publicity!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 12:01:56	Suggestion: All FSU fans attend CGD w/ POSITIVE JAMEIS signs citing good things JW has done. Let's use ESPN's public platform FOR him!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 12:11:16	@ThePHicks13 @shinny006 @TallyNoleJag32 @ShaneArrington1 I'd LOVE to see them try!!! #Mamabear
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 12:12:45	@TallyNoleJag32 @ThePHicks13 @shinny006 @ShaneArrington1 Yes!  No one says "no" to Kermie!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 12:17:56	@TJ_Pittinger Think positive! It gives us longer to defend our QB! #PrayforFSUJameis
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 12:22:25	@dannykanell @Espngreeny OR just let them sign for fun of it to please fans like Jameis has always done!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 12:25:25	@EricLuallen You forgot the rest...With Criminole QB
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 13:22:13	@SectionBAnimals
"Authentic" Jameis Winston SIGN-ature.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 13:23:20	@SectionBAnimals *with pic of JW signing kids' stuff
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 13:28:39	@m4ddy @jmnpb996 double sigh
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 13:30:11	@TheBigAL99 @FSUnWoWarrior Absolutely. Those are the best ones.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 13:31:36	@hymnforrachel Gotta have it.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 13:35:05	@TallyNoleJag32 @URBABYSDADDY80 @TJ_Pittinger Hope WE are not getting too distracted w/messinstead of worrying about actual game as usual!?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 13:38:07	@TallyNoleJag32 @URBABYSDADDY80 @TJ_Pittinger yes / let's start worrying about ND instead of ESPN!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 13:40:43	@hymnforrachel I've been concerned about that all along. His life is forever changed and not for the good.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-14 13:43:58	@hymnforrachel yes, but dammit I REFUSE to let them steal my joy! Truth will prevail.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-13 21:56:37	@DonnaDeegan @melinasphotos @I_B_Phil @TheProfessorSD I hope JW sticks around and gets his Ph. D - just to spite them all!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-17 01:22:43	@NolesJags904 Row 25!!Go Noles!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 13:38:41	@born2chop @DanPatrickShow I'll be ready at 8:00 am at Doak! Go NOLES! http://t.co/RfVFk0Igsp
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 13:45:49	@BianchiWrites @ClemsonTom I am not surprised at this article, but am appalled at the misconceptions in it.As an FSU alumna,I am insulted!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 13:49:45	@ThePHicks13 Love this pic and that winning smile! So glad to see such progress-we need your cheers on Saturday, JJ! Watch &amp; be loud!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 14:03:05	@ScottJDonahoe @born2chop $30 at FSU athletic ticket office. Call and order/ be there or #BlameYourself!! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 14:08:21	@ScottJDonahoe @born2chop yes, I am sure. We were going to pick ours up as they are in office until 4:40ish every day, but they overnighted
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 14:09:44	@ScottJDonahoe @born2chop Just call today to reserve one - must have your parking pass to go with it.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 14:15:17	@canfish16 Just wanted to say this Seminole supports Jimbo and believes in him - and #5! Hope you all can avoid the "clutter"-got your back!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 14:25:44	@SectionBAnimals prolly what they have behind the scenes at ESPN already - will feel right at home! Love it, maybe add a couple pigs?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 14:29:17	@TallyNoleJag32 @SectionBAnimals yes, loudly bleating wafering sheep and butting goats?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 14:29:35	@TallyNoleJag32 @SectionBAnimals *wandering!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 15:09:25	@SectionBAnimals Well, of course there needs to be an OSTRICH!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 15:56:40	@jasonburns Good to know!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-17 03:53:14	@Rcarpentieri1 @NolesAndPhins yes, I know but this guy was saying until Pres.office said JW was clear,it was no go &amp; that Jimbo not in loop!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-17 12:54:18	It's a beautiful day in Championship Town! Go NOLES!! It's almost GAME DAY!!! http://t.co/PGNZ4fvxph
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-17 12:56:31	@TJ_Pittinger It's a perfect day before THE DAY!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-17 13:19:43	@MadisonSocial enjoyed dinner there last night - great place!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-18 02:59:18	@davidraider88 And the fact that FSU FINALLY released a statement sounds like they have checked all current sources and feel there's nothing
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-18 03:03:15	@Brian_Nole are you where I am??? http://t.co/HMWVRv5TEG
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-18 03:08:05	@JOENOLES @jbrading @jennifersterger was that proven against Favre?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-18 03:13:12	@Brian_Nole Ha! Great view! Go Noles!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-18 03:14:12	@JTWells4 Another dig at us by ESPN IMO.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-18 03:16:08	@MaitlandNole @Brian_Nole And loud up here!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-18 11:45:55	Get up - it's GAME DAY!! GOOOOO NOLES!!!!!! http://t.co/vp6ugTIMDF
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-18 12:11:20	@LostLettermen Do you see why we are on the offensive now? Self-protection is a powerful force.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-17 18:09:33	@m4ddy We paid $30 for our lot 14 to get in at 8:00 am - Tomahawk Level - don't know about civic center...go NOLES!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-17 18:13:24	@OneFLDynasty FSU  45 - ND 24.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-17 18:15:34	@FSUnconquered @espn Cannot believe...wait, oh yes I can...ESPN.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-17 18:17:26	@m4ddy Gotcha! It's a madhouse already up here!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-18 16:38:05	College Game Day!! http://t.co/OsRGlVyod0
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-17 19:21:29	@DonnaDeegan @FSUnconquered @espn I hope so!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-18 00:30:04	@Lovekenzie13Amy @ThePHicks13 @DJCURTI5 @NoleLover32 fabulous!! Happy Game and Homecoming Day to JJ!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-15 07:25:19	@idontwan2know Absolutely! You'd think with politics and all, that would be common knowledge by now.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-16 14:03:10	Disappointed that none of my hashtag tweets have made the "best of" list :( #BlameJameis
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-16 14:05:48	@TylerCommaJohn @TomahawkNation Where does the slander line run?? Feel like it was crossed long ago!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-16 14:10:22	I had no idea what a "firkin" was until I got educated by @MadisonSocial. Education will continue tonight at 6:00 with the tapping!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 16:07:38	@EricLuallen @jmnpb996 @hymnforrachel Yes, hope we continue to take higher route on this low road.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 07:07:40	@saintwarrick @jasonrmcintyre think he meant to say " where the Irish go to die.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 07:11:12	@saintwarrick it was a classic in a real scary kind of way.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 11:36:52	@Matt_Fortuna It was a good call.ND played a great game; don't lessen that by complaining about s call that was clearly obvious.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 11:51:41	@kevroe67 @Matt_Fortuna @JShankerESPN As an alumna of FSU, I couldn't be prouder-not just for win,but for class &amp; integrity shown by my team
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 11:55:43	@themikegreen54 Loved the Jimbo and Jameis Show!! Hope it stays #1 forever!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 11:57:00	@DavidBVisser And with a smile on his face! Good dog!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-16 14:12:06	@TylerCommaJohn @TomahawkNation It's like the world has suddenly gone collectively - and totally - crazy.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-16 14:21:06	@ThePHicks13 @canfish16 Wonderful news! I know one home TV that will be tuned into the NOLES!! Thx for the update!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-16 14:23:26	@FSUnWoWarrior Great! And I'm notifying my friend she must stay in bathroom as that is where she always is when we score.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-16 14:24:42	@ThePHicks13 @canfish16 No thanks needed here, just glad he is doing so well! Now let's focus on beating ND!! Go NOLES!

302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 23:43:02	@SBNationCFB @TomahawkNation And I predict no voice until about Tuesday...:-)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 23:56:50	@noleman95 @lowell_todd @Noled_Out @DJCURTI5 Proven facts: good heart, likes to joke around, loves Fishers,FSU football&amp;baseball.Next ???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 00:01:22	@WarchantBen @Sauteeman And then you did it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 00:07:45	@FlaStateGameday BOTH boys - adorable!! Pictures are worth a thousand words - words like "kind, smart, and important"...‚ù§Ô∏è
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-16 17:06:18	@Noles850 Missed it - details?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-16 17:16:22	@ShaneArrington1 Blood. FSU's to be exact.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 00:37:56	@WarchantBen ND did play very well, probably as good as possible; FSU on other hand still working toward full potential IMO.Good try ND.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 00:42:18	@Tim_Linafelt @WarchantBen best wishes to feel better for Coach Trickett. Know he is a proud Dad today - for his real son and his FSU Fam!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 00:46:33	@DJCURTI5 @noleman95 @lowell_todd @Noled_Out Yes! Absolutely. Most other info on him NOT proven is my point.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 00:49:51	@Noled_Out @IraSchoffel @lstaff25 yeah, just SEEMS like days.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 00:57:02	@AMFKNole I was exhausted by beginning of 4th qtr,and I can't use pregnancy as excuse! Congrats to you both-and applause-she's FSU strong!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 01:25:10	@JustCallMeNOLE why they gotta SHOW it???? Worse that zombie head crushes!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 01:55:46	@JustCallMeNOLE what just happened before commercial ?? Missed it?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 02:03:17	@m4ddy who left in car? I missed something.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 02:04:41	@m4ddy but did Carol and bow man go after them?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 02:13:34	@EMocadlo @StickHaring @melinasphotos Even though I know this is total waste of time, must comment that you don't know JW.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 02:16:11	@FSUeyedoc What a  doofus.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 02:16:40	@SkotDuran @davidraider88 Well done.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 02:18:47	@KilroyFSU Happened right in front of me. Was just plain shocking.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 02:20:46	@KilroyFSU watch your back. Not the bums, but just Gville.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 02:22:26	@BraaWebb @FSU_Football @NotreDame saw several after- and all very classy. Classier than UM fan who sits in our section. Like way classier.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 02:31:15	@KilroyFSU and in that shirt...Halloween coming...eerie at best!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 02:32:45	@DJCURTI5 @FrankCaliendo Why didn't Favre show at CGD? Did they explain??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 02:34:53	@jbrading @DJCURTI5 @FrankCaliendo really? Then why announce him? Did ESPN cancel him?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 02:36:09	@jbrading @DJCURTI5 @FrankCaliendo but it was really other? Or just us playing ESPN role?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-16 22:03:56	@Timinole @MadisonSocial @TJL_247 @saintwarrick Can't ever see that kind of thing happening at MadSoc-too much FSU &amp; Tally support there! ‚ù§Ô∏è
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-16 22:45:47	@DonnaDeegan @Corey_Clark I'm with you, Donna! All of these things are separate, and he's paid (&amp; dearly) for his mistakes in my book!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-16 23:39:24	@georgedohrmann @jmnpb996 As a Senior Writer for ESPN, I am appalled that you would write such ridiculously rude and inflammatory statements
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-16 23:54:29	Who is Chip Brown on "Coast to Coast"radio? Just said that Jimbo&amp; FSU Pres.at odds over JW and it's not over for Jameis or Jimbo.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-17 00:04:15	@DonnaDeegan @Corey_Clark I said already that I hope he stays and gets his Ph.D just to show 'Em all! How many years of eligibility???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 13:04:27	@WarchantBen We've all been there. Not a good place to be. And I'm not talking about the bar.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-17 01:45:33	@NolesJags904 you'll have a great view - section?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 13:18:19	@TylerCommaJohn What was that about?? Too conservative for me!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 13:23:22	@TylerCommaJohn I'm not complaining as it turned out good, but what if...scary thought.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 13:44:54	@edsbs I just love your name.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 13:47:40	@tpnolefan1 But it's a good bad Monday cuz NOLES.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 13:53:35	@RedditCFB @ShaneArrington1 Just grateful he keeps getting back up...and winning.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 14:09:48	@blairstokes @MadisonSocial Sooo agree. No barstool backs to hang your purse, so under bar hooks are essential! Thx @MadisonSocial!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 14:11:36	@JustCallMeNOLE Hope JW realizes how lucky he is to have such a caring coach. I think he does.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 14:12:56	@saintwarrick $uch a game.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 14:18:05	@AMFKNole Period. Case closed.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 14:21:03	@schadjoe @CFBPlayoff Especially with all the "one-loss teams" hype, I predict a mess. A huge mess.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 14:35:36	@LostLettermen Not a big fan of their football team, but sure gotta give the OSU band credit!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 14:48:21	@dannykanell @dvgNole Thx! We do well in #2 or #3 or #4...only # at end will be #1...again. Go NOLES!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 14:51:16	@seminolemendy if we can't keep Muschamp, would love to see Spurrier back...beating him was the best!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 14:54:24	@m4ddy Keep us posted...also cuz daughter flies Delta on Wednesday thru ATL. Hate this mess! Used to just worry about plane crashes...üò∞
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 15:04:48	@DarrellFrink @KJS407 @GentlemanLawyer As average(or perhaps a little above) white woman, I agree.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 15:15:32	@LMaez44 All that.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 15:21:03	@m4ddy Sounds like heart or something...? Anyway, not the worst, esp if not in suits.Hard not to worry, I know.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 12:03:57	@shinny006 And especially after they wished ND a good weekend. Looks like those two are good matches.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 12:14:52	@CTrickett9 @canfish16 Your Nole family is proud of you! Prayers for you and your family.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 12:18:50	@LogansTwitty uh, yeah! Walking back to car after, felt like I had played 4th qtr,today, feels like played all 4.Great win, but I'm too old!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 12:49:43	@CharlieTango5 Agree-same aimed at Jimbo too. Proud of both of them for showing class &amp; integrity in the eye of the storm.Proud to be Nole.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 15:21:02	@TKFSU @PhenomeNoles talked to a ND fan/friend IN Alaska - he said it was the loudest he has ever heard. But then again, Alaska.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 15:24:15	@Moojenowski if you fly with the owls, gotta get up with the eagles.(what my dad used to say after my nights out)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 15:25:26	@crystnadior I see this as s future CGD sign.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 15:27:54	@SeminoleReverie @PhenomeNoles Be careful...we're starting to sound like our parents.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 15:48:43	@crystnadior I'd say considering what we dealt with thru last week, we made a pretty good showing at CGD-maybe even made them think twice?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 15:53:01	@canfish16 Nole proud of Fisher family/Jimbo philosophy, but never more so than this past week &amp; last nite. Thx for reminding us who we are.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 15:57:39	@NolesVikesMavs @melinasphotos And people believe him...whatever he is saying. Guess can make of it anything they want!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 17:05:18	@crystnadior Yes, daughters were barely allowed to keep their signs after his passive/aggressive spiel to crowd http://t.co/wqCW4DdsGN
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 17:25:00	@rchrdpeacock1 @crystnadior yes-sorry. All are same from ESPN ( except Kirk). :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 17:26:42	@rchrdpeacock1 @crystnadior Yep, and plastic smiles.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 17:35:06	@dennisdoddcbs @JOENOLES Depends on whether you seek truth, or you can't handle the truth.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 17:58:27	@crystnadior no they let the signs in...mostly cuz cute girls too. üòâ
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 18:06:39	@JustCallMeNOLE Now Nike usually irritates me in general, but this I like.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 18:09:04	@DJCURTI5 @KiefOsceola Already do.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 03:40:24	@TJ_Pittinger @FSUWill agree! Can't go all the way back to Pa$adena PLU$ 
Dalla$!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 03:42:17	@TJ_Pittinger @FSUWill Me too! #FSUTwitterCaravan
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-19 20:02:11	@melinasphotos Great pic! Did you by any chance get s pic of JW helping Shad with helmet during game? Nice moment.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 03:43:44	@Noles850 I never look at my number, is that bad?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 04:02:24	@FSUChiefs I thought when you did Thriller, I had seen it all, but Beyonc√© was a real  show-stopper!! Great job!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 04:04:37	@SamiNole89 @Noles850 Thank you! Guess I should work on adding to it, but I enjoy all of my current followers very much.;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 23:57:19	@LMaez44 @TomahawkNation just saw a whole panel discussion of this. Other than Danny Kanell, the rest made no sense.these guys need real job
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-22 00:03:59	@TomahawkNation @BlakeC0 And we all know the Pope wears Garnet and Gold. So, we're good,
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 06:39:43	@idontwan2know The winner of the game might have been in question at times, but never the half-time.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-22 01:47:21	@DeweyKevin @danofero14 I have to agree. You can't give them an inch, or they'll take a couple of miles...sad, but definitely true.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-22 01:56:31	@Sportsgirl917 @DJCURTI5 @bwombat24 @URBABYSDADDY80 @danofero14 Its true. They hate us, and it's pretty mutual.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-22 02:04:14	@Sportsgirl917 @DJCURTI5 @bwombat24 @URBABYSDADDY80 @danofero14 it's just not as much fun to be mean to them when they suck so bad.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-22 02:06:44	@Sportsgirl917 @DJCURTI5 @bwombat24 @URBABYSDADDY80 @danofero14 ha! They are pretty desperate, like a feral cat backed into a corner.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-22 02:10:19	@Sportsgirl917 @DJCURTI5 @bwombat24 @URBABYSDADDY80 @danofero14 And they really do bring out the worst in us. Mutual dislike society.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-22 02:14:08	@Sportsgirl917 @DJCURTI5 @bwombat24 @URBABYSDADDY80 @danofero14 Haha! Love that! Raise 'Em right!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-22 21:37:38	I just heard that the reason Golson was off team last year for "academic" reasons was because he cheated and was suspended 1 yr from ND.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-22 22:09:01	@saintwarrick @Timinole Could we REALLY live with a former Gator HC on our staff???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 10:11:47	Daughters and niece made it into SB Nation article about CGD signs this past weekend at FSU. #GoNoles #BlameJameis http://t.co/MUyJu9v956
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 18:47:56	@RealChrisNulty Wouldn't need regular one if that existed.:-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-20 20:58:06	@seminolemendy I do have wonderful friends in Alabama...of course they are Seminoles, but whatever.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 13:03:01	@LogansTwitty which stadium for that playoff???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 13:06:49	@canfish16 @Jaboowins This pic just warms my heart.To have a child look up to you-what a wonderful feeling.Bless BOTH of their hearts!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 13:17:01	@LogansTwitty So hard to make travel plans, esp for that time of year!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 13:18:59	@LogansTwitty Yes!Pasadena too far,plus I didn't like Rose Bowl. Iconic, but super inconvenient.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-22 23:45:48	@DJCURTI5 Take home tests are s real cop out - for the professor!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 00:10:02	@idontwan2know heard they're performing it this weekend at Jags halftime.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 00:19:57	@NoSleepCapital Friend of mine knew one of his tutor/coaches in middle and high school. Said he was like that when he was like 9 yrs old.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 13:11:16	@hymnforrachel That is TOTALLY inappropriate! Even the doll IMO. Good grief.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 13:17:27	@IraSchoffel Are they going to be OK against Louisville? That game worries me. Pretty much like every game does actually.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 13:19:39	@FSUeyedoc Sad to divulge thst my two sisters are Gators, and I haven't heard from them since week 2.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 13:27:38	@VALadyNole Cannot wait to send this out to all my Gator "friends" whom I have not heard from since the start of the season. Thanks!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 14:16:23	@MFFLpeterBU @FSUeyedoc We need to remember that arguing with an idiot never works. They have way too much experience.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 14:23:53	@MFFLpeterBU @FSUeyedoc Thanks so much for your concern, but I'll take my chances.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 01:03:20	@DJCURTI5 and prolly only skim reads them...but I did find I learned something from them as research is on you. Good luck!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 01:07:59	@DJCURTI5 Awesome! How do you know?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 01:12:09	@LogansTwitty have always hated Dr. Phil(and I use that title very loosely) - now I have good reason.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 16:38:53	BREAKING NEWS: UF new head coach: Condoleeza Rice.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 01:20:14	@MitchellWesley @URBABYSDADDY80 @fsuprobz @espn @Rachel_Nichols Sending this on...good read!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 01:22:36	@MitchellWesley You mean his foot, don't  you?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 16:04:19	@Noled_Out @jbrading if we fans could help turn the media with the #BlameJameis campaign,why can't we further rectify public opinion on him?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 16:18:06	@bomani_jones @Laws23 And how tired Jimbo looked-can't imagine how he had energy to be in BHAM on Monday morn!Id say that reporter is lucky!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 16:24:01	@jasonrmcintyre @thebiglead AND on an American flag???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 16:25:50	@jmnpb996 AND on
An American flag?? FSU would've been crucified if happened at Doak!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 16:29:05	@TomahawkNation It was best yet - another half/time victory for the Chiefs!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 16:33:05	@espn @pcbeachlaw Class act, Mr. Coates!! Best wishes for good health for "lil sis",
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 17:23:38	@ChopChat_ Great article!!! RT!RT!RT!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-21 17:46:04	@jmnpb996 @idontwan2know I'm just glad he's gone. Talk about integrity issues...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 22:50:24	@Warchant_Willie @DRusso97 I knew when I saw this, it was just a matter of time till some nut job said something rude.Y are people so cruel?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-24 14:25:51	@93Noles99 I'd agree, at the risk of being "controversial".
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 14:18:01	@TJ_Pittinger I was there too! So happy to see FSU honor him as they should. Gracious, great man.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 14:22:22	@BryceStrand @fsusean83 I like it when they pick against us. Makes us work harder And their picks less and less meaningful.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 14:32:46	@ESPNCFB @NissanUSA #HeismanVote Winston
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 14:36:47	@christhorman So I can't do this if I'm in US??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 14:43:08	@christhorman But are u sure they will show Chiefs performance? Could care less about the game itself. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 14:45:07	@NateGreer26 And we'll just keep winning - without their support, thank you very much.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 14:52:11	@christhorman LOLOLOL /FSU Marching Chiefs are performing at halftime of Jags game.Thought that was Chiefs reference of your first tweet!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 15:54:11	@FSUeyedoc Is this real???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 15:55:34	@JTWells4 @FSUeyedoc Sad that I had to ask to make sure, huh?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 15:57:13	@JTWells4 @FSUeyedoc Ha! Didn't even see that -all I was focused on was last entry!! I'm quitting Twitter!! Haha!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-25 12:05:05	@hymnforrachel Just saw this...what now???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-25 12:07:58	@DoakSCampbell what happened?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 18:45:01	@FSUChiefs @Beyonce @Jaguars How did it go?? Wish they would show on TV!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 19:12:40	@EricLuallen $59.99 sounds like a bargain!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 19:19:24	@MostlyNoles @chrisnickinson
Malted milk balls. Even name is gross.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 19:20:35	@DonnaDeegan Poor guy.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 19:22:19	@MostlyNoles @chrisnickinson yuck.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 19:24:20	@DevinFSU nope. Little Snickers.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 19:26:36	@DonnaDeegan Are you at game? Did Chiefs perform halftime?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 19:28:20	@TallyNoleJag32 @DonnaDeegan As good as in FSU/ND game? Only reason I wanted to go to Jags game. :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 19:30:50	@DonnaDeegan Great! Wish they had showed some portion on TV instead of all the "talking heads". At least fans got to see good halftime show!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-26 21:05:44	@davidplack @FSUChiefs @floridastate @Jaguars Hope there is a video clip coming for those of us who couldn't attend. Heard it was great show
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 00:06:59	@youngjwy @SamiNole89 Creepiest thing I have ever seen! Yikes!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 00:11:35	@NOvieraLE love it! #Jameistrain
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 00:56:23	@melinasphotos @GarnetNGold22 Hope you got some good pix of the Chiefs doing Beyonc√©! #FSUAmbassadors
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 01:07:24	@hymnforrachel Soooo gross. Tainted meat.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 01:28:36	@jmnpb996 Yes, and their hair never grows.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 01:37:01	@hymnforrachel Had to happen!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 02:03:52	@Waldeez247 @Auburn247 @BamaOnline247 I am an FSU alum,but have enjoyed AU games w/friends for years. Phillip was my favorite, may he RIP.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 02:10:00	@JustCallMeNOLE yeah, so why was Carol hiding??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 02:17:56	@JustCallMeNOLE Do you think she's been bitten?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 02:20:52	@JustCallMeNOLE Yeah, think you're right. And this whole thing with Beth is gonna be very weird.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 02:23:01	@JustCallMeNOLE Scary. R u watching Talking? Gareth in real life seems so normal. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 02:59:00	@AMFKNole People are all over the place with predictions.Think it's just stress of playoffs/committee/SEC bias talk.Hard to just enjoy game!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 23:06:53	@FSUeyedoc How do you keep running into these jackasses??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 23:14:32	@FSUeyedoc Never ceases to amaze me how mean people can be!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-23 23:56:42	@ThePHicks13 Sounds like he is getting great care. Still keeping him in prayer.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-24 00:00:17	@ThePHicks13 That's good. Will make him feel more at home to be in familiar setting/people. Glad to hear he is doing well!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:42:07	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola IF that's true, then it won't be the first time that a majority is wrong.I stand with Jimbo.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:47:35	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola Evidently the fact that his program is currently 2nd only to Bama in recruiting has escaped your attention.Ruining?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:48:34	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola Oh, Lord. Give it up, son. You're out of your league.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:54:53	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola I can promise you more than you have. But I'm not the one telling you how your coach should run his team.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:58:29	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola I have no idea,&amp;again you miss the point. I,too,dislike Bama,&amp;infact have always been AU fan,but point was recruits
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 01:01:59	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola Thx for clarification. At this time,zero. Suspect that would make u think you scored a point, but nah.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 01:09:34	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola Perhaps you currently manage hundreds on the job, but don't grasp how a family works.That's the mindset of our team
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 01:12:30	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola Goof for you, and I have 45 yrs experience in special education, so pls don't preach to me about leadership.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 01:12:59	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola *Good
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 01:15:59	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola So then you should understand! Honestly always felt AU and FSU similar in philosophy.Bama=UF
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 01:18:18	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola Maybe. But we'd cross each other on Jimbo! My youngest actually dates an AU man, so I have experience w/your kind;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 01:51:33	@m4ddy Agree been in long harangue about same with AU fan. Why can't we all just get along?????
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 01:53:52	@m4ddy Amazing, huh? Actually said Jimbo was a puppet coach and Jameis running team.'
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 01:56:01	@m4ddy I know, right? We went back snd forth forever. Don't think I made any inroads.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 02:22:00	@jacques_patrick If you're HALF as good as your recruit video, you'll have a great future at FSU! Happy to have you - welcome to the family!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 05:44:18	@GodofKrypton @SirSeminole95 This is a "must-read" for ANYONE on any side of the Jameis Winston saga. Do yourself a favor a read it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 05:48:08	@GodofKrypton @SirSeminole95 For some reason it won't allow me to retweet original tweet??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 05:49:12	‚Äú@GodofKrypton: this is phenomenal, http://t.co/ebVgawdWo1‚Äù
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 14:07:12	@TimBrewster @dvgNole Congrats on pulling in a great kid!! #NoleNation
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 20:22:47	@Mark_Schlabach @jbrading Thank you for responsibly clarifying the issue. It won't go unnoticed by those who depend on factual information.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 20:25:07	@ClayTravisBGID @seminolemendy But for your convenience, you can catch him on his radio show instead. You're welcome.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 20:27:02	@jbrading @Mark_Schlabach yes, but it's a start, huh? Let's see what they report on ESPNTV / haven't gone there yet! (And I may not!)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 22:02:16	@IMGOING_Hammer @Timinole Mr. Er, Hammer, is it? Pardon me, but you don't know what the hell you're talking about, sir.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 22:07:49	@FSUeyedoc saw on FB, of all places, that there were eye witnesses confirming his innocence. Sound familiar?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 23:06:05	@bamaproud10 @ShaneArrington1 Prayers for all!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 23:11:29	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola Your question is unclear, but if you're inquiring as to Jimbo's character, I'm proud to say it is above reproach.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 23:31:26	@jbrading @Flastar23 2nd question: and easy to get into FSU???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-27 23:43:56	@fear_the_spear_ @Sauteeman @jacques_patrick  Yes, we are honored to have a young man of your talent level join our FSU Family! #NoleNation
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:04:03	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola Again, sir, if you are referring to Head Coach Jimbo Fisher,I'll use an AU term: he's All In. Great coach,good man.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:07:08	@seminolemendy Sorry! Rise above them - for a good Nole, that won't be hard!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:12:21	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola What does that have to do with anything? I am an FSU Alumna with great pride in FSU and confidence in our coach.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:14:04	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola Again, how can defending his players when he has no evidence to the contrary be "wrong"?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 18:19:13	@TheReal_Riley @CollegeGameDay @floridastate Classier that your Twitter name.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 18:22:48	@withrowzone @AUgrad1997 Nothing has been proven yet. And we still believe in innocent until proven guilty.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:14:55	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola does yours at Auburn?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:18:30	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola My daughter already graduated, but no, she felt safe at FSU &amp; did not belong to the Cleat Chasers of recent repute.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:22:00	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola How Gus handles his team is his business; I'm sure he has his hands full. I trust Jimbo to handle the Seminoles.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:24:37	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola That is your opinion,but we feel he is a good man, father, and leader of a talented team of young men.Respect that.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:29:29	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola Obvious that you have a personal problem with him, but we respect him and believe in him.Not worried about stock.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:32:48	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola I'm sure you know from your experience that a coach cannot 'control' anyone,neither admin nor boys,just lead.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:34:33	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola Again, I disagree, and find it sad when someone's logic is so clouded by personal issues. We will agree to disagree
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 00:37:48	@AUgrad1997 @KiefOsceola And he does. Just bec you don't like him or disagree,doesn't mean he is not in control.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-28 20:09:04	@AUgrad1997 @withrowzone Very funny.:-/ He simply knew 17 yr old suspect in robbery case; gf is not accusing him of anything. No case.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-29 02:03:13	@NoSleepCapital Reminds me of the Challenger.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-29 02:06:33	@SEC_Exposed @TheEsquireof212 So you're doing the reverse psychology thing, right?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-29 02:33:15	Don't you just wonder what Jimbo is thinking tonight? He's gotta be tired of all this mess.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-29 07:59:12	@hodakotb Really enjoy your daily quotes! Thx for the inspiration!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-29 18:10:21	@TheEsquireof212 Except I hope you're wrong about FSU/Louisville.but I get your point...here's hoping Jimbo reads this to team in pregame!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-29 18:47:24	@idontwan2know Also loved "dances with sanctions"...too good!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-29 16:16:09	@jtlightt @TheEsquireof212 Why do you keep retweeting this mess?? Don't give them attention!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-29 20:30:31	@Terence_Huie Enjoys every setting he is in!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-29 20:35:02	@BlakeC0 @GentlemanLawyer And "autographs" it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-29 20:41:20	@BlakeC0 @GentlemanLawyer I'd LOVE to get such a huge tip! Guess it would be more than enough for whole team's tip!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-29 20:43:05	@idem7 @jbrading #BlameJameis (again)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-29 20:44:37	@KySportsRadio Pass the crackers and the melted butter.

302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-29 20:58:40	@FSUNOLE21 @CBSSportsCFB Obviously desperate for "news".

302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-30 07:52:36	@hodakotb How do you get up this early every day???you must go to bed at 7:00 pm!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-30 11:28:37	@NOvieraLE @hymnforrachel @AMFKNole Yes, and in light of some previous game day issues, I hope this is as controversial as today gets.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 13:50:44	@noleman95 @FSUeyedoc @djasper1 Yeah, I'd definitely do both - helmet and game. Will be watching for you on TV.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 13:52:50	@jmnpb996 @TheBenSwain Not talking about us cuz we won, and couldn't dig up ANYTHING negative. However, it's early.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 13:55:01	@FSUeyedoc @noleman95 @djasper1 And agree you will need it in that wind today - have you been outside??after 80 degrees yesterday, freezing!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 13:58:56	@TJ_Pittinger @FSU_Football Yeah, and with us spotting teams 21 pts as per 'Shad, my heart needs a Saturday off with win under our belt!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 14:01:18	@ricobert1 And they were already drinking Mad Dog from last year.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 14:13:42	@edsbs What I want to know is, if Mussy gets fired tomorrow, are you changing your name? #lovethevisual
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 14:14:32	@TallahasseeJay I won't be. #keepthisdefense
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 14:18:05	@LostLettermen Already showing some hat-swag. Hope that's a good thing.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 14:28:44	@seminole4life22 We knew that when JW threw ball over frat house. And never questioned it again.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 14:33:32	Ok, CGD at new low. masks?? Really???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 14:36:27	@FSUSportsMemes Poor Corso's. No clue.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-30 16:28:23	Colin Cowherd REALLY irritates me. Sooooo hope we bury Louisville tonight, just for him.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 04:40:51	@FSUNOLE21 @OneFLDynasty And then Louisville made him a starter? Guess with their coach, that's permissable.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 04:47:30	@OneFLDynasty Good Lord. And no mention of it during game, but mentioned Los??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 04:49:32	@SportBarrister @OneFLDynasty Just wow.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:03:28	@ESPNCFB @JustCallMeNOLE Keep hating us cuz that's what you're good at;as for us, we'll just keep winning, cuz that's what we're good at.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:07:41	@shinny006 Must've been great to be there! Bet you're exhausted!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:09:00	@OneFLDynasty Figures.No surprise anymore and I'm getting into this "embrace the hate" thing.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:10:01	@jellis76 @OneFLDynasty @SamiNole89 so to speak.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:27:35	@dannykanell @YaAlreadyNole History repeats itself.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:36:06	@cblunt58 Better and easier!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:38:28	@celess_95 @TheEsquireof212 Tough,
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:52:16	@c0nservative23 @TheEsquireof212 @TJ_Pittinger @SteveZagline Maybe, but not tonight.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:56:51	@CanesFamNews @jmnpb996 Luck had NOTHING to do with this one.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:58:10	@NikkiHavey @FSU_PartyTutor Definitely in league of our own.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 16:53:27	@IraSchoffel @Blake_Johnston7 @CollegeGameDay One word: EMBARRASSING.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 17:17:30	@FSUeyedoc yeah, he obviously didn't get the memo(s).
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 17:27:07	@LostLettermen Corso never really recovered from the mask skit.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 06:47:38	@HeAT_TrIo305 @Warchant But we're better than you.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 06:52:18	@TomahawkNation yeah, it would be so great if they could just sometimes be quiet.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 06:55:46	On watching this replay, I really find I do not like that Mauldin. Just a leeeetle too cocky.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 07:01:12	@FSU_Fuel @FSU_Football This is when a Thursday night game seems like a good idea. Little extra recovery time.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 11:35:45	@DonnaDeegan that CAN'T be a Jax paper !?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 11:53:06	@ShaneArrington1 @HeAT_TrIo305 @Warchant I know, right? Already thinking of who I can use it on (minus a word or two, of course).
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 12:01:40	@m4ddy Cheeseburger is my go-to cure
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 12:03:43	@canfish16 @AlligatorArmy Amen!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 00:38:03	@bradleySFR three FSU tables at Ale House where I was left at half-time. Shame, shame.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 00:39:46	@LostLettermen Oh, poor Mike. No privacy!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 00:41:03	@bradleySFR Jax...it was great! Lots of loud fans - especially in second half.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 01:43:25	Ok, I'm officially afraid of the Slippery One.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 01:44:37	@jensanti1890 @TheEsquireof212 as per Lou Holtz. Consider the source.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 02:00:16	@shinny006 just saw Lane's. Wondered same.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 01:14:38	@melinasphotos maybe take it off unless you put it on just before last TD
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:15:27	@_TomBlock I'm with Clifford. Way too old for these come from behind close ones.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:26:31	@LogansTwitty Go get 'Em!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:32:11	@AMFKNole ab-so-effing-lute-ly!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:37:06	@cblunt58 And I really love that we can #BlameJameis for it all.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:55:41	@ScottCrumbly @TheEsquireof212 It's called "convenient logic".
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 06:00:55	@melinasphotos You just keep wearing that hat, and everything will be fine. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 04:37:29	@OneFLDynasty What did Dyer do to get thrown out at Auburn?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:29:58	@Tim_Linafelt Learning to be a father from one of the best.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 05:53:48	@SethHorne2 @TheEsquireof212 Nice for whom??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 06:35:05	@NoleDigest @YahooForde Talk about finding crumbs...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 06:45:48	@idontwan2know they tried, but no dice.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 06:49:55	@Noled_Out @NoleDigest @YahooForde But he can't take any of that - too positive!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 11:41:42	@jireland80 I'd rather be a fly on the team plane headed back to Tally!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 11:51:30	@DonnaDeegan Of course. I'm just surprised you don't need a magnifying glass to read the headlines, and a compass to find it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 11:57:47	@DavidBVisser @TvilleNole Agree, but first, let's just win the next one...then the next...etc
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 12:00:35	@jmnpb996 Isn't it great that we're standing in a place where we can be most concerned with his writing mechanics?? Love it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 12:05:23	@TallyNoleJag32 @outlawnole Speaking of half-time adjustments - how DO they do that?? Magic?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 13:16:22	@Timinole Threading the needle. And if you've ever seen, you know just how hard that is.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 13:17:45	@DoakSCampbell Sorry, but what did #32 do?

302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 12:08:51	@JustCallMeNOLE Gonna be a BOOtiful day - thanks to our NOLES!

302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 12:22:59	@jmnpb996 @woodywhitehurst I LIKE that...God's Seminoles. Got a great ring to it. Yep.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 12:24:40	@JSandlin502 @ClemsonTom @ABG_OAF Used to happen to us in Gainesville all the time. UL better than that, I would hope.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 13:18:34	@blackhatnoles @JCameronShow nope. I don't choose that name-didn't turn out so well for AU...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 13:20:43	@DoakSCampbell that's weird...maybe new # due to new unis? #BlameNike
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 13:25:25	@IraSchoffel @PhenomeNoles Are you sure we weren't in G'ville???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 13:26:17	@crystnadior @osfsu Wonder how many of these stats will be hyped on ESPN today??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 13:27:14	@crystnadior @jbrading Eaking up the neighbors to this inspiring music!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 13:27:41	@crystnadior @jbrading That would be "Waking"
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 13:39:02	@93Noles99 @YahooForde But, that was Bama.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 03:22:24	@JaredWilkinson @DoakSCampbell @BarrettSallee Better question: do you think Miss State could stop #5???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 03:24:53	@JaredWilkinson @DoakSCampbell @BarrettSallee Well, I hope we get the chance to see. For the record, my money's on Jameis.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 03:27:15	@JaredWilkinson @DoakSCampbell @BarrettSallee Btw, awesome game tonight. Marshall is scary good too.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 03:33:12	@BradLoganCOTE @AUgrad1997 Did they say what injury was? Broken foot, leg, ankle? Looked bad,
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 03:37:47	@AUgrad1997 @BradLoganCOTE yeah, it looked really bad. Hated that for him; played really good game. Wasn't AU players fault though.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 03:38:49	@JaredWilkinson @DoakSCampbell @BarrettSallee And I've thought all year, more defense, or am I missing something?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 03:40:43	@JaredWilkinson @DoakSCampbell @BarrettSallee It was pretty much who had ball last / then that injury fumble. But good game.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 03:46:15	@SamiNole89 I'm not sure I can approve of this kind of betting.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 18:13:58	@93Noles99 Besides us winning, he's just damn fun to watch. Family.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 18:32:42	Does anyone know if team is off and JW might have been flying through Houston today? My nephew swears this is him... http://t.co/AIJ7sYn4J9
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 19:35:43	@joshnewberg247 @TheEsquireof212 Bet when he sees the replay, he'll be pretty sure he made correct choice.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 20:55:12	@TheEsquireof212 @ShaneArrington1 @HeAT_TrIo305 @Warchant well, but truth is we've NEVER been down as low as they usually are, so...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 21:06:26	@TheEsquireof212 @ShaneArrington1 @HeAT_TrIo305 @Warchant Just blocked his nasty mouth.ridunkulous.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 21:14:30	@jmnpb996 @AlaNole I keep thinking I have heard it all, and then some yahoo says something like this! Leave my QB alone!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 18:20:23	@FlaStateGameday @JCameronShow Prayers for your adorable son. Hope he is better soon! Strength and comfort for his parents.üôè
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 18:34:58	@Text_N_Tweet Thats what I was thinking...but looks too thin in this pic...nephew didn't approach for JW's privacy.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-10-31 19:27:17	@NOvieraLE Good question. Nephew was so thrilled to see him, don't know if he noticed! I'll ask.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 06:33:27	@Mama_Reb @AUgrad1997 Will pray for good results and recovery.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 01:58:36	@LogansTwitty Team didn't win?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 12:02:44	@RealChrisNulty Thank you for your service.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 13:02:53	@LostLettermen Giving football a bad name.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 13:05:14	@bradleySFR Yep, headed to Crescent Beach - huge home on ocean not far from golf courses - not tough decision.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 13:06:44	@FSUeyedoc yeah, it's like it happens, but no celebration. Rip-off. It's really the little things in life, isn't it?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 13:08:47	@SBNationCFB headed for Crescent Beach.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 13:12:59	@KilroyFSU @Treohfivesole "That's not how ANY of this works!"
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 13:14:59	@FlaStateGameday @christophersonW Otis, you're just bitter.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 13:16:33	@KilroyFSU Or dogs.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 13:29:25	@KilroyFSU Smart. I used to have that rule about my kids. :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 13:31:25	@FSUeyedoc Not biting this time. I know you.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 13:34:54	@FSUNOLE21 No one would think that I hope. It was a no-win situation for all and a sad ending to a great game. Prayers for Treadwell &amp; Frost
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 13:38:23	@FSUNOLE21 That's just sad. Some real sicko's out there.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 13:41:39	@Treohfivesole @KilroyFSU Pieces of JW are not on menu. Sorry. UF did great agst UGA, cuz UGA.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 13:42:55	@KirkHerbstreit NOW , you got it, Kirk. Proud to know Ya!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 13:48:05	@Treohfivesole @KilroyFSU Get your best game on. We'll be ready when you get here.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 14:02:50	@Treohfivesole @RealTzaddi @KilroyFSU UF won't have a lead. Any lead.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 14:10:13	@FSUNOLE21 @dennardjl @SuccessfulQuon And from this FSU fan on east coast...lifting you up!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 14:14:45	@RealTzaddi @Treohfivesole @KilroyFSU Ok, I could live with that.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 14:20:24	@LowellPoynter @DonnaDeegan @KirkHerbstreit @CollegeGameDay My noble rescue watches from wherever he wishes. #bestdog http://t.co/qdfDkTilTe
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 03:23:44	@LogansTwitty So sorry to hear that! We're any kids physically hurt? Hard to coach thru a surprise loss.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-01 03:29:13	@FlaStateGameday @LogansTwitty Sooo cute!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 14:38:24	@S_Blaylock @NOvieraLE Oh, we will. That's what we do. 24 straight.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 14:41:31	@JOENOLES Love it, but a little difficult to see the 5; is that just picture issues?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 14:48:24	@TallyNoleJag32 @URBABYSDADDY80 Thanks for the regrets, but we're just fine in Tally without you.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 15:45:09	@FSUeyedoc once burned, twice shy. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 15:50:25	@CollegeSpun @ClemsonTom Big baby.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 15:54:51	Not that I don't already know the answer, but how could ESPN leave #5 out of Player of Week honors?Do Thurs Nite games not count?or just us?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 15:56:27	@LMaez44 @KirkHerbstreit @CollegeGameDay FSU Homecoming??;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 16:00:58	@LMaez44 @KirkHerbstreit @CollegeGameDay Do you know why we are kicking off at 6:30? Odd time.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 16:02:49	@kevin_carden Yes, suddenly Ark viable opponent. Strange magic.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 16:04:34	@kevin_carden I know it's Sunday, but hard not to hate these guys.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 16:05:25	@kevin_carden Spin masters.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 16:07:45	@kevin_carden How they develop one-loss strategies to fit their plan is nothing short of creative.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 18:51:55	@FSUarmy @AP @USATODAYsports it's like Thursday night's game never happened.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 18:56:57	@FSUarmy @AP @USATODAYsports Just.So.Wrong.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 19:06:40	@Warchant @IraSchoffel Good point. Hard to do when constantly hearing negatives and/or "crickets"...but agree Champions should rise above.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 19:13:03	@melinasphotos Agree with you Melina!...however must admit I don't MIND the pants.:-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-02 19:14:36	@sdb2fsu Really beginning to hate these polls. #makenosense
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-04 20:52:57	@fsunelson @CMRE24 I definitely see someone's doctoral thesis on the misinformational effect the media has had on CFB this season.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-04 22:03:01	@JustCallMeNOLE @MagicFan1459 Of  course the correct saying is "a tough row to hoe" as in difficult manual labor in land prep for farming,
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-04 22:06:33	@SECstats @lil_hammock Yes, otherwise am sure FSU vs Clemson would be on list
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-04 22:09:52	@FSUarmy @MOTS_3 Agree. Used to be on about 5-10 yd line on row 62...needed height to comp for UF line.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 02:46:15	@davidraider88 He deserved it. But pretty gross.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 02:48:51	Black kids gonna get it.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 02:53:49	@harlenshack Noah's the one in bushes with Darryl..?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 02:55:41	@harlenshack Boy, Beth wasn't messing around.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-04 02:18:48	@TJ_Pittinger Thought you were bidding in a child's card game.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-04 02:20:23	@TJ_Pittinger I'll see your Spider 2Y banana and raise you a monkey 4 S pineapple.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-04 02:21:16	@TJ_Pittinger You all in???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-04 02:40:41	@jjordan2006 @JTWells4 @espn Now that's a story folks need to see!! Well done!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 00:17:52	@FSUarmy @LuvDemNoles22 @MOTS_3 I will also say I moved to other goal line on row 25 and have enjoyed watching warm ups/pregame from close
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 00:26:32	@mrallcanes @NolesAndPhins @CanesFootball Old joke. But typical choice for the U
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 02:57:25	@harlenshack yes, and she knew he'd come back for her
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 03:00:53	@harlenshack uh-oh, Carol!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 03:09:18	@JustCallMeNOLE Soooo has Carol been planted there by Darryl to save Beth or is she really hurt???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 03:14:40	@jbrading @McMurphyESPN More accurately you can't spell Jameis Winston without Jameis Wins!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 03:16:39	@JustCallMeNOLE Remember how tough Carol was when she singlehanded my took out Terminus? She's gonna get Beth out!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 03:19:20	@JustCallMeNOLE yeah, no way. Carol has a whole new persona.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 03:23:06	@JustCallMeNOLE and Dawn will never expect it! Then Darryl will arrive with Noah and arrows!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 03:23:39	@JustCallMeNOLE we have it all figured out! Haha
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 03:25:33	@harlenshack @AMCTalkingDead oh! I didn't see that. Wow
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 05:04:40	@AMFKNole Me too!! Not sure if it's because of Pasadena, but the Rose was life changing! I think it's gonna be FSU/AU again.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 05:12:27	@AMFKNole Yep, and your wife and I are calling it Auburn. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 05:50:38	@GentlemanLawyer @davidraider88 @ChristFamNoles Yes /feel superior to AU, altho would like to show SEC that we can best both. So either ok
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 01:41:30	@saintwarrick more importantly, why is no one talking about JW's hearing? Did I miss something?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 01:49:09	@paulhting @mrallcanes @NolesAndPhins @CanesFootball True FSU fan here, but moving forward not holding onto past;but then, that's what U do.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 01:54:25	@paulhting @mrallcanes @NolesAndPhins @CanesFootball Agree. Canes have no real traditions. Sad for you.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 01:58:47	@DavidBVisser @ptynole Any thoughts on effect of JW conduct hearing?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 02:03:52	@ptynole @DavidBVisser Underdtood, but any predictions on outcome of hearing? Are we worried??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 02:07:48	@Timinole Thought they were calling it for Crist???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 02:09:26	@Timinole oh! Thought it was Crist - can hardly stand either one,.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 02:11:38	@nolanolegal @Timinole Ugh. And that's not borne of sadness over Crist losing.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 02:12:26	@DavidBVisser @ptynole Thought it was scheduled for Nov. 17??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 02:15:06	@nolanolegal @Timinole Not sure what Hanta is, but I can imagine some sort of heinous, life-sucking, viral infection aimed at stealing joy.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 13:09:23	@LowellPoynter Great smile with lots of love in it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 13:28:05	@FSUNOLE21 @TMatich Guys, you're forgetting the most important point and the reason for EVERYTHING: we aren't SEC. Period. Case closed.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 13:33:46	@TallyNoleJag32 @FSUNOLE21 @TMatich - "Put a smile on your face-we're Florida State!"
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 13:36:20	@TallyNoleJag32 @FSUNOLE21 @TMatich Love it! Now THAT'S the attitude! It's great to

302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 13:42:02	@JCameronShow @Noleman1985 Continuing to lift all of you up in prayer. Have faith, and hugs to your sweet son!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-03 13:46:57	@ChristFamNoles @TJ_Pittinger I do follow Him, and now, you. Lifting your precious twins in prayer. All will be well.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 02:16:13	@ptynole @DavidBVisser As someone said lots of lawyering to do. ;-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 02:20:26	@ptynole @nolanolegal @DavidBVisser Gotta feel sorry for JW w/how long this is dragging out,and all he wants to do is play ball &amp; graduate
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 02:22:15	@nolanolegal @Timinole Hence the political comparison. ICWYDT
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 02:27:02	@paulhting @ScubaSteve864 @NolesAndPhins @mrallcanes @CanesFootball Or the best selling..,"Can't Spell Sucks without the U"
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 02:34:34	@paulhting @ScubaSteve864 @NolesAndPhins @mrallcanes @CanesFootball How do you spell"delusional"? UM
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 02:37:11	@paulhting @ScubaSteve864 @NolesAndPhins @mrallcanes @CanesFootball Yes, certainly your fan base(or lack thereof) speaks to yoUr popularity
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 02:46:32	@paulhting @ScubaSteve864 @NolesAndPhins @mrallcanes @CanesFootball Paul, you buy tshirts celebrating crimes?? Oh, guess U have no choice!

302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 04:48:14	@DJCURTI5 Rose Bowl trip is so expensive. Not sure I can afford a second trip. Sure had fun last yr though...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 04:50:50	@DJCURTI5 idk I spent a fortune last year, but will be hard to stay away...prefer Nola...maybe we'll b #1 by then!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-05 04:51:55	@DJCURTI5 was hoping for that anyway, now budget demands it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-07 00:59:31	@FSU_Football @TheEsquireof212 @Tim_Linafelt Nice article about a talented young man. Makes me wonder if FSU didn't fail HIM?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-07 01:02:12	@CampbellSoop Read Tim Linafelt's article on JW's preparation for greatness. Damn shame how he is regarded thanks to media.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-07 01:05:46	@ClemsonFB @theACCfootball @nfl and no fans.?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-07 01:09:40	@TGMowerman @FSU_Football @TheEsquireof212 @Tim_Linafelt Agree Mower, just makes me sad. But we're the adults here, right? Right?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-07 01:16:22	@TGMowerman @FSU_Football @TheEsquireof212 @Tim_Linafelt Few of us were. Bottom line is, his leaving is going to be our loss.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-07 01:16:51	@TGMowerman @FSU_Football @TheEsquireof212 @Tim_Linafelt And I'm not really talking football.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-07 01:21:29	@TGMowerman @FSU_Football @TheEsquireof212 @Tim_Linafelt yes, but I disagree on when - think he really wanted degree and I more year in BB.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-07 01:31:59	@TGMowerman @FSU_Football @TheEsquireof212 @Tim_Linafelt yes, but think also by FSU due to public opinion pressure.Not 2 beat dead horse,but
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-07 01:40:51	@TGMowerman @FSU_Football @TheEsquireof212 @Tim_Linafelt You are $$$$$oooo right!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-07 01:43:46	@TGMowerman @FSU_Football @TheEsquireof212 @Tim_Linafelt Don't  we all!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-07 02:11:12	@AMFKNole Ya think?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-07 05:33:42	@JOENOLES Done! Have faith.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-06 23:00:17	@CampbellSoop Wow. That's all worse than I thought. Why aren't we panicking??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-06 23:57:52	@CampbellSoop just makes me furious that he is having to deal with this! Ought to be able to stay at FSU as long as he wants!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-07 00:03:09	@perrykos this is getting REALLY old.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-08 19:54:05	This. Go NOLES! http://t.co/3Vc8XnDzZB
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-09 10:27:05	@FSU_Football @christophersonW @Kidz1stFund @canfish16 My favorite part was watching Ethan dance with his doctor on sidelines. Powerful duo!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-09 12:48:42	@hymnforrachel It was cold in the stands.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-09 12:59:06	@FlaStateGameday @VALadyNole Constantly amazed at the criticism of this one young man. TY for trying to show that JW is a good young man.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-10 02:41:24	@melinasphotos do you know why this was a different Osceola than has been in previous games this season? Alum/HC? He was great!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-10 02:44:01	@melinasphotos @ChiefDrake and was it the same Renegade as earlier in season? This performance was stellar! No offense to current, but...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-10 02:53:22	@crystnadior Was pretty sure when he spouted that "scientific" jargon he was saying earlier tonite. Bogus.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-10 02:54:52	@jmnpb996 Yep, that's why they just can't have anything nice in WD.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-10 03:02:39	@crystnadior dang. If say Abraham's out of there. Eugene already gone.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-10 03:05:58	@crystnadior so talking dead indicating Eugene not dead...hmmm
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-10 03:06:25	@crystnadior And about to get crazier.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-10 03:10:49	@crystnadior exactly. Glad I never read the comic; like being surprised
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-10 03:16:30	@darrenrovell @AMFKNole Sir, IMO, it is YOU who should be investigated for your slanderous reporting and constant, unfounded defamation.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-10 03:26:36	@AMFKNole Pain is temporary. But he scares me.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-10 03:29:54	@sneakerseminole @AMFKNole yep. This is kinda weird, but I actually thought of him today and wondered how he was feeling. Excuse: I'm a mom
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-10 03:33:51	@sneakerseminole He would have to be. Physical and emotional. I pray for him; maybe unnecessary, but makes ME feel better.;-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-10 03:36:02	@sneakerseminole I hope he realizes he has support in the midst of all these nut cases he had to deal with.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-11 03:40:16	@Moojenowski It was the old Osceola back for homecoming.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-11 04:31:36	@MOTS_3 You do know that Meghan Boone is an FSU grad, right? Was traveling so have not seen tonight's episode...don't tell me!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-11 04:33:29	@MOTS_3 She is great -and Spader is masterful! Was this season finale? Couldn't be already!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-11 04:36:57	@MOTS_3 WHAT????? You don't mean taking it forever do you??seems like the season just started!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-11 04:39:00	@MOTS_3 Well that stinks! Thx for info. If my DVR didn't work, I'll be back for details.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-11 04:39:56	@celebrityhottub Somehow that doesn't surprise me.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-11 12:06:48	@RealChrisNulty Happy Veteran's Day! God bless you for your service! Be safe, and Go NOLES!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-17 01:09:16	@melinasphotos You can't control others and what they do. Just continue being the best sideline photog!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-17 01:13:08	@TKFSU @FSUChiefs And it sounded like a home game from TV-all because of the Chiefs and the War Chant!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 12:10:40	@SportsCenter @LMaez44 Jameis is one of greatest to play the game, and wins in the face of extreme adversity over and over. #unconquered
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 12:15:02	@SBNation Wow. Just wow.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 12:17:02	@AriyaMassoudi @Sportsgirl917 It really is that simple. And that amazing.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 12:22:15	@DaySinceFSULost @Sportsgirl917 #BlameJameis and #ramsey and #irving and #cook and #edwards and #los and #lane and #aguayo and #Jimbo and...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 12:27:43	@ObnoxiousAUfan @AUgrad1997 As an FSU fan, I agree! Coming back from adversity makes AU (or FSU) stronger and the family even prouder.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 12:29:29	@jbrading @_RobertoAguayo He's our rock. Just simply the best.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 12:32:24	@_TomBlock @canfish16 Yes, but if like me, the fireplace will be roaring!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-17 15:15:35	@dannykanell would I be correct in thinking that the ESPN predictors have been more wrong than right this season? Like, a lot more wrong?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-17 15:17:21	@BiggBear23 @dannykanell As I remember it we beat the best the SEC had to offer in Pasadena last year, AND we are 26-0 ICYMI.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 12:41:40	@CharlieTango5 @SportsCenter @LMaez44 Agree Charlie, but I can say it now based on his ability facing off-field adversity. A 20 yr old kid!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 12:50:04	@Adam_Klug @sneakerseminole Once again, and always, proud to say, "That's my QB!"
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 12:58:22	@NolemanJason What I say about their style is that it's #UNCONQUERED!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 13:07:59	@TJ_Pittinger I'm up and waiting to read it and love it!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 04:57:21	@TallahasseeJay I'd say Muschump is gonna have to sell his half of the beach house.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 04:58:55	@TallahasseeJay yes. May already be in foreclosure.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 14:20:54	@Carson_DeMotto @TheEsquireof212 You couldn't be more wrong.First, you don't know him; 2nd, watch him w/children, his teammates, his coach.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 14:21:41	@Carson_DeMotto @TheEsquireof212 Again, I say, you don't know him.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 14:29:00	@MarkNagi @cdowlar Speaking of sheep, let yellow journalism be your guide;@cdowlar obvious exception to the media rule. He gets job right.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 14:36:42	@ChopChat_ @harlenshack And this is the same guy they call "arrogant", "cocky", "selfish" ??? Great team player!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 14:39:58	@TJ_Pittinger It would be hilarious if it weren't soooo true. Go NOLES!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 14:45:46	@marcuslemonis @JustCallMeNOLE @floridastate @MiamiHurricanes Thanks for your generosity! Oh, and by the way, we'll take that bet any day!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 14:47:58	@CharlieTango5 @Jaboowins Cam did a great job! Couple of low snaps, but overall the protection was definitely worth it!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 14:53:53	@sportingnews @FSUeyedoc Great football! Btw, how did your truck fare at the (upside down) U, FSUeyedoc?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 14:54:52	@CharlieTango5 We'll be fine. One game at a time. Slow and steady wins the race every time.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 14:57:54	@AMFKNole @jmnpb996 @cdowlar As Jimbo said few weeks back, with Freshmen you take good with bad. #FSUfamily
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 14:59:11	@jensanti1890 @Andy_Staples @nolanolegal Boom!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 14:59:51	@PeterMBrown45 @PlayoffFootball @ESPNCFB @CFBPlayoff @mark_may and I with Finebaum. Call the ambulance!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 15:03:18	@PhenomeNoles Scared me when first saw your tweet. Thought "Timmy Tebow"!!! Then, it's the apocalypse.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 15:06:36	@Jon_D_ @ThePHicks13 And you're surprised at this?? It's Miami.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 15:15:47	@osfsu Agree. He doesn't seem happy anymore. Heartbreaking.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-17 20:53:48	@jbrading Wish I could double favorite this!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 06:24:18	@Carson_DeMotto @TheEsquireof212 For goodness sakes, why?? I'm sure he doesn't hate you.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 20:42:47	@Carson_DeMotto @TheEsquireof212 All I know is,26 straight wins,which, of course, includes the National Championship against best of SEC.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 21:22:16	@WarchantBen And is it true that younger brother kicker is headed to FSU???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 21:25:34	@canfish16 @TvilleNole No, it's most definitely OUR honor. Kudos to all the Fisher family - you represent us well! #proudfamily
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 21:27:32	@AriyaMassoudi Certainly more than all other UM games combined this season - and maybe last.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 21:32:21	@Jaboowins No matter what they say or do, it is your right to be happy. Don't let them steal your joy in football-or in life. #wesupportyou
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 21:34:04	@NolesAndPhins @WarchantBen I even remember a pic of both brothers re: legacy for FSU. Did I dream it???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-16 21:36:16	@NolesAndPhins @WarchantBen Lets keep our fingers crossed! Can't imagine we could lose him to someone else!! #alwayskeepanaguayohandy
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 11:25:59	@saintwarrick @pcbeachlaw @FSView Chiefs always support. #FSUnited
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 11:52:46	@TvilleNole I have to ask - why? Did u cry at a chick flick?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 12:05:24	@VALadyNole @TvilleNole you both are very serious about this man card thing. Strict rules! Go easy on yrself -altho fireball is alw good.;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 12:08:16	@VALadyNole @TallyNoleJag32 @TvilleNole BUT you cannot have a true tailgate w/out it. It's a law.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 12:10:02	@TallyNoleJag32 @VALadyNole @TvilleNole Must've been someone from ND. Rough night for them.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 12:12:49	Much nicer wake up today. #FSUnited
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 12:27:48	@TvilleNole @TallyNoleJag32 @VALadyNole you'd be welcome but we're going to Mad Soc tomorrow-lot of our group not coming Sat.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 12:28:59	@VALadyNole @TvilleNole @TallyNoleJag32 Hard when back to back games at Tgiving.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 12:31:01	@TvilleNole @TallyNoleJag32 @VALadyNole @MadisonSocial Yes, great place! good food, drink, fans and football-nothing better-&amp; view of Doak!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 12:32:47	@TallyNoleJag32 @TvilleNole @VALadyNole @MadisonSocial was thinking of skipping, but BC is my other alma mater...but love beating them! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 12:37:56	@FSUjessica2011 @bradleySFR @_TomBlock Hope all fans will stay for this after game tomorrow. #FSUSTRONG

302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 13:48:09	We may not be family by birth, but by choice and heart. #onenation #oneheart #weareFSU
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 13:50:37	@MostlyNoles one of mine chose free, one chose FSU; both diehard fans forever. #NoleNation #FSUhasmymoney
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 13:58:05	@TheBobbyBowden Memory fading??? Dadgummit, that's just a big fat fib!! Love Ya, Coach!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 13:59:12	@EricLuallen @FSURich either way...you're stuck. ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 14:02:42	@bradleySFR @dannykanell Happy Birthday to a great QB, AND best sports analyst. #tellthetruth
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 14:04:02	@MojoFishing Have to hope he is way smarter than I...makes me nervous.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 14:05:57	@newsbest001 @ClemsonTom In the wise words of Phoebe from Friends..."My eyes! MY EYES!!!!"
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-20 03:29:43	@m4ddy @SeminoleReverie @nolanolegal I have to confess, I couldn't finish reading it. Made me ill.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 15:02:27	@MojoFishing I know, saw credentials. That's why I'm guessing he's smarter than I. ;) Still...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 21:35:33	@SeanRossman @Corey_Clark Do we know their condition?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 21:57:23	@DavidBVisser @NoSleepCapital Classy.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 21:59:54	@TJ_Pittinger Right behind you coming from NEFL coast. #FSUnited
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 22:01:07	@fsunelson @ricobert1 Didn't this already happen once??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-20 13:32:09	@kevinjohnson366 @ItsGreatUF Just block and report. This has NO place on any public site. #prayforFSU
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-20 13:33:57	@TJ_Pittinger @kevinjohnson366 @ItsGreatUF Pls don't RT, instead block and ignore him.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-20 13:39:40	@PhenomeNoles Let us know when you hear. #prayforFSU
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-20 13:40:44	@TJ_Pittinger I know, just hate to give people like that any views. Sad.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-20 13:41:40	@TJ_Pittinger Absolutely. #prayforFSU
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-20 14:01:20	@Caraleigh24 @TJ_Pittinger Now THIS is a great RT! Glad to hear your loved one is ok after such a tragedy. #prayforFSU
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-20 14:04:00	@BaxterBenjamin @espn @ESPNU I don't even think she knows what an "opinion" is, do not sure she is entitled to anything!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-20 14:14:58	@TB424 oh wait!!! That's not what I was  responding to if that's what he said!! Forgive my misread- OF COURSE NO ONE DESERVES THIS!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-20 14:19:54	@Caraleigh24 @TJ_Pittinger absolutely. #FSUNITED
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 03:30:58	@TJ_Pittinger The Chick something - can't remember...chick flick??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 03:33:08	@nolanolegal @YouTube For this situation, it's perfect. Well done. #FSUnited
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 04:57:51	@Timinole Yep. You just sealed your fate. Maybe it will be ok to return for next season, but only with permission and forewarning. Sorry:-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-20 23:08:57	@mattgaetz @KilroyFSU makes it even sadder.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-20 14:29:43	@UF @TJ_Pittinger Thank you for your understanding and concern for our FSU family. #norivalryinthis
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 12:04:35	@WarrenSapp And more importantly - it's Game Day! Go NOLES!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 12:10:24	@HateFuelsUs Yes, me too. Evidently the weather is going to fit the sadness of the past week, but we will be #FSUnited.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 12:23:10	@NoleDigest @nytimes Evidently, it's impossible.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 12:32:24	@TallyNoleJag32 Nicely done.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 12:38:58	@WillieGeist @BostonGlobe Bet he loves responding when someone says,"it doesn't take a rocket scientist..."
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 15:01:10	@usedwigs @FSUnoleSC The concerning part for me is not Jim Bob racing in jeans, but more that someone on Twitter watched 19 and Counting.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 15:02:51	@BenElting @stpete2you @darrenrovell @nytimes And don't forget to add the old #BlameJameis hashtag.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 15:05:25	@peterberkes @jmnpb996 my Krispy Kreme was also good.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 15:07:53	@jmnpb996 @peterberkes And getting bundled to sit in rain at Doak. Nothing.Better.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 15:11:26	@bwombat24 me too, but skies looking ominous already
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 15:13:45	@bwombat24 Yep, hoping to head home early in morning. With a win, of course.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 15:18:29	@davidraider88 Good man.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 15:20:10	@jffjnny @jmnpb996 uh, because Buckeyes.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 17:29:43	@Jmacfsu24 Ha! Just did the exact same thing! Must be the weather.;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 20:40:16	@FSUarmy RT'ing but for the record I HATE that it's going to be @Jaboowins last home game. #wantanotheryear
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 22:29:40	@DevinFSU I will die if we don't.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 22:44:38	@dtackett_ @PhenomeNoles I've been saying it since forever! Weather was at best distracting, and at worst, it was Baaastin weather.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 23:31:57	@dreschenendorf True, however sheer rivalry gives gatas some pts to start. Almost unpredictable.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 19:21:28	@mattytally score??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-22 19:23:01	@m4ddy any more news on deputy shooting this morning?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 03:12:27	@FSUarmy Plus, dammit, I just like the kid.Long time teacher here-give me the kid like @Jaboowins w/a little spunk who loves life &amp; learning
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-21 05:05:20	@SoILSeminole @FOXSports Thanks to Matt Leinart for giving credit where credit is long overdue!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 03:18:41	@EricTheNole  Oh, no. Such sad news. Prayers for him.#FSUnited
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 03:58:31	@PhenomeNoles I just asked the same thing! First, nothing to joke/scam about;second, JW would do such a thing, so I don't get the reason.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 04:00:47	@AMFKNole @crystnadior wow. To sound like my mother,"what's this world coming to?"
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 04:04:47	@jmnpb996 Romo caught the dreaded Jameis Fever!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 04:07:42	@crystnadior @AMFKNole Now YOU sound like my mother too. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 05:55:06	@danofero14 I saw forecast of sunny and high of 61. That would work.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 13:05:07	@flbeachdad @pcbeachlaw I hope the poor guy has some good ear plugs.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 13:09:22	@pcbeachlaw @flbeachdad Amazing restraint on his part. Why can't we all just get along???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 13:10:59	@bwombat24 Or by luck. Not even Andrew Luck.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 13:12:40	@jmnpb996 And missing the helmet to helmet on Jameis. Even I saw that from section 36.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 13:14:43	@LuvDemNoles22 @ShaneArrington1 @DonnaDeegan @thekissman2 @KiefOsceola @pcbeachlaw Easy to think was true, knowing JW even little bit.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 13:19:54	@LuvDemNoles22 @jmnpb996 why did he come back out before end of game? Players applauded him. Thought he couldn't even be on sidelines?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 13:38:35	@kevin_carden @TallahasseeJay It wouldn't be Monday without it. Or Tuesday. Or Wednesday. Or...you get my drift.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 16:03:00	@ClemsonTom @SDS Funny, but Gators ain't no Obi Wan!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 16:07:33	@davidraider88 @CollegeSpun I'm sure they will anyway. Fine with me. Love that attention! Beginning to relish it, in fact will miss it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 16:09:13	I will agree with The Committee #BeforeThisEmailBreaks
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 16:12:31	@TropicalNole @bwombat24 @wmdavidcornwell yep, he's snagged a bunch of us. Hope it's not bogus!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 15:22:11	@hymnforrachel so sorry! Playing hockey??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 18:54:15	@TallyNoleJag32 whatever happened with Cornwell?? Been away from Twitter for a couple hours...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 18:57:17	@TallyNoleJag32 OMG - just to repeat- this season has aged me considerably. And that ain't good.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 19:00:51	@TallyNoleJag32 Amen! Between my kitchen remodel, &amp; worrying about Jimbo and Jameis - Lord!! But Cornwell- a little unconventional?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 19:02:07	@TallyNoleJag32 He's the boss, I guess...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 19:03:32	@TallyNoleJag32 Yes, hope he's a helluva lot smarter that he sounds sometimes...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 19:03:43	@TallyNoleJag32 than
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 19:06:34	@TallyNoleJag32 yes, I heard,don't really know how I fell about that either. Gotta get back to my life(kitchen makeover).Thx for (non)info;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 20:54:29	@FSUarmy Prolly just our wishful thinking...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 00:05:25	Lucky to meet the famous @melinasphotos on the field at Doak! You can tell which one of us is the photographer! http://t.co/DojygCJGu5
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 00:16:25	Proud of my NOLES for the win, and proud of me for lasting 4 quarters in the pouring rain! http://t.co/XpocqZDgpo
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 01:18:46	@Pelham33 @LuvDemNoles22 @Warchant_Willie Same boosters who wouldn't give the man who built all this one more year as per his contract. ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 02:17:05	@Warchant_Willie @Pelham33 @LuvDemNoles22 yep. I understood many felt it was time for him to go, but ashamed that we made him. Disrespectful
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 02:22:39	@TallyNoleJag32 Seriously no answer from sir Cornwell???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 00:31:05	@harlenshack @melinasphotos Even in the worst conditions! #rainraingoaway
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 00:43:38	Only at FSU... http://t.co/e7LMPxVDcb
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 02:28:46	@TallyNoleJag32 do you have any clue if it's good or bad news?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 02:31:07	@TallyNoleJag32 Very odd. Hope it's not a late Friday night bombshell again!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 02:03:33	@TJ_Pittinger @FSU_Football or Southern Mahi, grits and collards at Harry's. ;) http://t.co/zPOdnp0OQp
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 03:05:27	@KilroyFSU Were you at the game? Weather was very distracting! I missed a lot of stuff happening right in front of me.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 03:08:40	@NFL_CFB @Warchant_Willie the dumb ref was in the wrong place! Leave my QB alone!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 03:50:21	@NolesJags904 @DeweyKevin Just when you think you've heard it all...how can people do these things? Seriously.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 05:59:37	@FSUWill Please, let's not mention it. Makes me very sad.#needanotheryear #justonemoreyear
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 06:06:21	Why ISN'T Rashad Green a Heisman candidate???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 06:12:39	@Scalphunter9399 @TheEsquireof212 @pmcsorleyNYG Jameis needs another year with us @FSU.You can't have him yet, NFL. Quit drooling.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 06:19:03	@TheEsquireof212 @Scalphunter9399 @pmcsorleyNYG @fsu I know,&amp; it makes me mad!thx to media/false accusations, his choice of college 1st-out!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 06:21:58	@TheEsquireof212 @Scalphunter9399 @pmcsorleyNYG @fsu  At least he has that to b grateful for! He would've hated the SEC.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 06:23:20	@TheEsquireof212 @Scalphunter9399 @pmcsorleyNYG @fsu Exactly, and I don't think he would've lasted in that environment for a month!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 06:26:48	@Scalphunter9399 @TheEsquireof212 @pmcsorleyNYG @fsu The only thing that may soften the blow for him is leaving with Rashad.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 06:31:28	@Scalphunter9399 @TheEsquireof212 @pmcsorleyNYG @fsu Sure u r right, but hate the way choice was taken out of his hands.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 06:35:52	@Scalphunter9399 @TheEsquireof212 @pmcsorleyNYG @fsu I agree&amp;know part of my reasoning is selfish; will miss his particular football joy!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 06:37:36	@RealChrisNulty yes, but aside from that ;) - seriously, why?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 06:41:09	@Scalphunter9399 @TheEsquireof212 @pmcsorleyNYG @fsu Agree, and even when it IS over, it won't really be over. Like u said - legacy.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 06:43:17	@RealChrisNulty boy, that really burns me up!! So unfair to the student athletes!! Can't we anonymously send his name in or something??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 06:50:00	@Scalphunter9399 @TheEsquireof212 @pmcsorleyNYG @fsu and what a pleasant surprise that was! I didn't know of him, and what fun that was!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 06:53:38	@Scalphunter9399 @TheEsquireof212 @pmcsorleyNYG @fsu I missed all that, but after Pitt, I made sure I never missed another minute of JWBall!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 06:55:47	@Scalphunter9399 @TheEsquireof212 @pmcsorleyNYG @fsu Think you weren't alone in that! Close to miraculous football, a passing phenom!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 06:56:27	@Scalphunter9399 @TheEsquireof212 @pmcsorleyNYG @fsu And I don't mean passing as in fleeting!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 07:03:42	@RealChrisNulty seriously,remember the whole 6 degrees of separation thing-somebody must know somebody! Someone w/followers,start campaign!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 07:14:09	RT if you'd like to see Rashad Green nominated for the Heisman.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 03:19:07	@dtackett_ man up! I sat on the 20 yd line for four quarters in a plastic poncho.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 03:21:41	@KilroyFSU me too. Between trying to see out from under my poncho hood and not drowning, i need to watch the rerun.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 03:38:51	@Corey_Clark I keep saying the weather was very distracting
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 03:45:46	@DonnaDeegan @TomahawkNation giant mess! Just a mess. Glad we got out of there with a win...against refs.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 03:49:21	@FSUMogle @ricobert1 BC def had weather advantage. Today's nasty mess is a pretty day in Baaahston.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 03:52:22	@PhenomeNoles just told my friend, had to check Twitter to see what you guys were saying re next week. Just keep saying the truth.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 04:03:31	@ScalmEm @FSUMogle @ricobert1 I stand corrected. Went to grad school at BC and still can't get it right. Too Southern. :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 04:06:18	@ScalmEm @FSUMogle @ricobert1 yes! Only saving grace is that none of them ever got "yall" correct either.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 04:07:21	@WarchantBen weather.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 04:09:08	@ScalmEm @FSUMogle @ricobert1 Bless your heart!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 04:16:39	@ScalmEm @FSUMogle @ricobert1 Impressive! Don't forget to count your expert handling of the language of Twitter.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 04:18:22	@WarchantBen @SamiNole89 I realize there's no weather inside, but they played for 4 hrs in it outside just prior to interview time. Clear?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 04:24:21	@WarchantBen @SamiNole89 I get that, but it was a rough night - and week. Maybe give them all a bye this time.and I know u have job to do.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-23 04:41:11	@TheOneBarrelRum me too! Announcers didn't say a word! Had it been FSU PLAYERS...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 04:36:12	@FSURich now THIS is irony.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-26 12:17:44	@DevinFSU Love my 6; the + was just too big. One hand texting impossible on +.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-26 12:20:07	@ShaneArrington1 it's ok. I feel your pain.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-26 12:39:30	Just a thought... http://t.co/VQMI3zrkW6
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-26 12:46:46	@TJ_Pittinger Swamp monkeys?! Love that. Gonna use it in my Thanksgiving blessing tomorrow..."and thank you,Lord,for letting us beat the...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 12:17:43	@FSUeyedoc @LuvDemNoles22 Me three!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 12:53:08	@ShaneArrington1 @thekissman2 @KiefOsceola @pcbeachlaw @UF I also heard the story was fake, but it IS typical of what JW would do. Good guy.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 12:57:42	@bwombat24 @pcbeachlaw @thekissman2 @KiefOsceola I'll see your $3 taco, and raise you $11 worth of gator tail.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 13:18:05	@LuvDemNoles22 @jmnpb996 yes, and JW was hit HARD! Scared me. Altho Thomas hit was unnecessary, don't you think?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 13:22:52	@LowellPoynter @LuvDemNoles22 @jmnpb996 Agree! Looked like he could've stopped momentum, but chose not to...dumb move at best.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 13:25:45	@LowellPoynter @LuvDemNoles22 @jmnpb996 Was a little less intentional looking, maybe.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 13:26:46	@LowellPoynter @LuvDemNoles22 @jmnpb996 Yes, but can't afford to keep making poor choices if he wants to play.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 13:29:18	@LowellPoynter @LuvDemNoles22 @jmnpb996 Sounds a little too familiar for many on this team, huh?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 13:30:58	@LowellPoynter @LuvDemNoles22 @jmnpb996 But gotta love 'em! Sometimes forget many are not even voting age.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 13:37:10	@Poynter @DonnaDeegan @nytimes Imagine that!! NYT trash.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-24 14:10:36	@TallyNoleJag32 @seminolemendy @kevin_carden @TallahasseeJay Trying hard not to get hopes up. #fingerstoescrossed
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-26 13:30:45	@cdowlar Mad Soc is a must! They do a lit to support causes - like to return favor. Win-win.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 11:31:15	@EricTheNole Plus the CNN reporting of it all was ludicrous.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 12:50:23	@TJ_Pittinger more than what? Was there news earlier??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 13:06:04	@xmanjay02 @ClemsonTom @lefty051116 @SoSportsCentral This made me laugh. Too true - gotta love 'em!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 13:21:25	@LowellPoynter @TJ_Pittinger IS there more? Is he just trying to fire us up, or what???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 13:23:31	@m4ddy checking the net will make convince you that  you have some dread disease only found in The South Pole.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 13:25:04	@LowellPoynter @TJ_Pittinger Just seems like a weird way to handle all this...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 13:27:26	@LowellPoynter @TJ_Pittinger Well, I would certainly hope so! No mention from TN? That concerns me some...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 13:31:46	@wmdavidcornwell Unfortunately the underlying problem is that he doesn't have public sympathy on any level. That worries me for him big time
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 13:33:42	@m4ddy How are you feeling now?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 13:39:45	@nolanolegal Think he was a little wound up. I wish you were the problem with America! I'd see a lot more hope then.;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 13:41:03	@m4ddy Ay least you didn't check net at night; you'd def be in ER by now. Haha glad you're better!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 13:53:15	@jmnpb996 @nolanolegal @idontwan2know @AMFKNole So that's a tidbit of good news. It's this disciplinary process that worries me,not evidence
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 13:54:58	@nolanolegal betcha he thought from your name, you were in legal profession...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 13:56:04	@nolanolegal I used to think that...not that there's anything wrong with that...;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 15:50:53	@AMFKNole Sometimes I feel like his writing talent is being wasted on the sports world. Should be Hollywood, maybe?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 15:51:47	@KiefOsceola uh, not sure about the no agendas part...sarcasm?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 15:55:06	@KiefOsceola true, but think there are lots of agendas floating around too! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 15:57:40	@AMFKNole Agree, he could be the john Grisham of sorts novels. Crank out one after every game.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 15:58:02	@AMFKNole *sports novels
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-25 16:01:29	@KiefOsceola yep, just arguing for sake of it.;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-26 01:24:57	@FlaStateGameday Just love both of them!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-26 01:32:37	@Scalphunter9399 @BleacherReport I'm really starting to hate this committee.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-26 10:14:01	@TravHaneyESPN @PlayoffFootball @Big_Morry I think they're all a little short on that 'thinking' thing.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-26 11:46:19	@cblunt58 That hurts my heart.üíî
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-27 11:34:31	@ladyscalphunter @jbrading @LuvDemNoles22 @Jaboowins Feel the same, and never even met him. But we've been thru a lot together!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-27 11:42:31	@jbrading @LuvDemNoles22 @Jaboowins Any chance of #onemoreyear ???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-27 11:56:07	Happy Thanksgivivg #FSUTwitter ! Grateful for being a member of Nole Nation. Enjoy your turkey, I hear it tastes just like gator.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-27 11:58:09	@FSUeyedoc See you at Doak! Go NOLES!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-28 09:54:27	@SeminoleGreg @NolesVikesMavs To interrupt, I'm an older alum, and wish we had @Jaboowins for another year! Media screwed his chances ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-28 10:12:05	@NolesVikesMavs @Jaboowins should stay w/Jimbo and get degree. He deserves that opportunity like all student athletes;not be forced out :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-28 12:58:30	@dubee24 if they're season tix you can get them replaced at ticket office

302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-28 17:17:09	HELP!!! @FSU_Football #FSUTwitter forgot to order my early tailgate pass for Lot 14. Evidently ticket office closed today. Can anyone help??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-27 15:07:41	Now THIS is a Thanksgiving pie! #serveitup #GoNoles http://t.co/bdn4dNyCOI
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-29 14:56:35	Getting it started in Lot 14! Go NOLES!! http://t.co/xAa1NeGS7e
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-29 15:34:11	@ShaneArrington1 yes, as my mama used to say "no accountin' for some family"!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-11-29 15:34:42	@ThePHicks13 I hear you loud and clear!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-01 13:51:26	@SamiNole89 Whenever it is, sending positive thoughts and prayers to @Jaboowins for a good outcome. #truth
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-01 14:05:02	@FSUeyedoc Now THAT would be the best case scenario! Btw, enjoyed meeting you in our Lot 14! #besttailgatespot
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-01 14:19:35	@hymnforrachel @BryceStrand And I just have to think the constant negativity has made this year just...different, at the least, for him. ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-01 14:37:44	@jmnpb996 @Andrea_Arneson pls explain one more time who plays-is it #1vs#4; and #2 vs #3?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-01 17:27:18	@DonnaDeegan @TomahawkNation Thanks for sharing again. Logic and ESPN - what an unusual concept!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-01 18:02:26	@VALadyNole Best positive thoughts for a speedy recovery! Noles need you, so hurry and get better!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-01 18:04:19	@FSUeyedoc @ESPN_Colin @Jaboowins Sounds just like something someone who leads a cowherd would say!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-01 18:06:51	@nolanolegal @MadisonSocial My advice is to ALWAYS follow the advice of the Social Workers at Madison Social. They are never wrong.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-02 05:44:11	@EricTheNole @YouTube We're better with a musical background. Excellent, in fact.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-02 10:21:10	@BushidoNole Eat a banana - potassium.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-02 11:28:19	@TheAlbert939913 @shinny006 Thanks a lot for the reminder that I am too old for Twitter. :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-02 12:19:02	@NateAndrews29 @adown15 Because we are UNCONQUERED.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-02 13:58:19	@LogansTwitty Do u know time frames? Each day how long? How many days? Etc
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-02 13:58:54	@OsceolaNole @DoakSCampbell is that true??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-02 14:00:34	@OsceolaNole @DoakSCampbell Gotcha. How about how many days?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-02 14:06:48	@jbrading @PhenomeNoles As an English teacher, I can tell you this is the stuff of nightmares.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 02:32:27	@RossyNole10 @noleman95 I, for one, don't like it one bit. In fact, I do not accept it, nor do I recognize it. I refuse.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 02:33:52	@nolanolegal @slmandel I do not accept that, I call bullshit.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 14:37:38	Thx to @MikeAndMike for finally calling out injustice to FSU on ridiculous #4 ranking. #indefensible
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 14:40:05	@TJ_Pittinger yum, but no fun. Feel better.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 14:42:02	@Andrea_Arneson I said same thing this morning. I STILL say he wants his degree first. Crazy maybe, but true.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 14:47:29	@nolanolegal @Andrea_Arneson yes, and that's what really gets me going! I love my FSU, but hate when they succumb to media/money pressures.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 14:49:06	@Andrea_Arneson @nolanolegal yes, agree in regards to future civil proceedings for one, I would think.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 14:52:42	@nolanolegal @Andrea_Arneson and another thought is that FSU may not have option once this lawyer has his day.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 14:54:23	@TJ_Pittinger feel your pain. Get some Emetrol. Half teaspoon every 15 min...otc.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 14:57:35	@TropicalNole @nolanolegal @Andrea_Arneson that's my point too. His rights as student def jeopardized. If this COC decision in his favor...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 15:00:15	@crystnadior @MikeAndMike That decision was totally indefensible...also couldn't conceive of convo where FSU would be out if close win vs GT
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 15:02:02	@TropicalNole @nolanolegal @Andrea_Arneson If what he WANTS is his degree, he may just spit in their face and keep on keeping on. #righteous
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 15:03:28	@crystnadior yes, reiterated it over and over with callers/guests. Finally. For whatever it's worth at this point.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 15:05:57	@TropicalNole @nolanolegal @Andrea_Arneson Not saying any of you are wrong, but with craziness of this whole past 2 years,who really knows??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 06:20:13	Any news on JW's hearing today? I've been gone.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 06:33:40	@perrykos soooo glad u finally figured this out
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 06:44:10	.@ESPN I picked Florida State to be my @DrPepper #OneFinalTeam. http://t.co/j932L5i120
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 18:55:32	@DeweyKevin @shinny006 Hey! Wish I could REMEMBER my 30th bday!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 11:28:26	@RealChrisNulty wow. News said they were in there for 25 min. This is such a weird thing - did that help or hurt JW?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-04 01:24:35	@PatrikNohe @Scalphunter9399 So with him not testifying today, how does that affect things???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-04 01:33:55	@PatrikNohe @Scalphunter9399 just saw the whole thread about this wacko. Omg. What next?????
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 11:36:21	@RealChrisNulty gotcha. How do you think it will all turn out? Best guess.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 11:53:25	@RealChrisNulty yes, read that late last night. And Cornwell seems very confident. But lawyering maybe. If decision is good, think JW stays?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 12:13:23	@RealChrisNulty thinking maybe due to impending civil case.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 12:14:40	@NoleN3ws Setting a terrible precedent for everyone.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 12:16:26	@RealChrisNulty I get that for sure. Between personal witch hunt and FSU hunt by media, all fun is gone.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 12:54:37	@mattleo33 @Sauteeman maybe, but that isn't following the rules of engagement.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 13:29:09	When FSU comes from behind in another thrilling finish to win the Natty again, does the Committee award the trophy to the other team???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-03 13:33:39	@KilroyFSU Agree with @nolanolegal - wasting brain power trying to figure out their non-logic. Giving them too much credit for smarts!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-04 15:02:11	@LowellPoynter @PhenomeNoles Agree with what must be unbelievable pressure for JW in midst of all this. Can't blame him when game suffers.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-05 03:17:44	@DJCURTI5 Sooooo jealous!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-04 21:59:32	@seminole4life22 Totally agree. No fun in Muddville.üòî
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-05 13:52:31	@nolechick94 WS it bad? Didn't watch.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-07 23:59:27	@ThePHicks13 Whatever works!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 01:01:00	@D_Fifer @jmnpb996 It's early yet.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 01:59:26	@shinny006 Just FYI, ticket office said $175 &amp; $250 for Sugar &amp;Rose; $450 &amp; $650 for Dallas tix. Unless something changes, Super Bowl prices
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 02:16:09	@shinny006 That's what season ticket holders were told were the FSU otter ticket prices. And you're right. It's nuts!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 02:16:38	@shinny006 *alotted
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 02:19:19	@shinny006 Me too - and something tells me we'lol have lots of company! Rose was great last year - but expensive &amp; worst fan stadium ever!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-07 05:44:28	@jmnpb996 @jhileman79 @CFBHeather And you wear dumb non-football hats.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-07 05:47:50	@DMiddle47 @jmnpb996 @jhileman79 @CFBHeather Oops. Wrong Heather. Right hat.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-07 05:48:29	@jmnpb996 @jhileman79 @CFBHeather Wrong Heather. Right hat.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-07 05:56:30	@TylerCommaJohn Amen!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-06 02:27:26	@FSUWill what three? Thought Oregon was only one of note?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-06 02:31:44	@FSUWill gotcha. Thx.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-06 02:33:40	@harlenshack @PatrikNohe You could prolly get away with it as long as you have the tshirt and beard - and of course the white jeans.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-06 03:05:22	@FLSportsJunkie either I'm on a delay or he just said it again!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-06 03:53:31	Is it just me or does this look like high school game?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-06 03:58:40	@kevin_carden Can't believe Mariota is even compared to JW. Throwing pass past line of scrimmage? Seriously?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-06 04:03:39	@kevin_carden yes, and maybe he deserves it, but I hope this is his worst game. Not impressive.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-06 04:07:29	@idem7 it's like comparing a burger to a filet mignon; a rhinestone to a diamond; you catch my drift.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-06 04:09:35	@kevin_carden yes, aside from Jameis, not many impressive QB's in CFB. Still don't know why Rashad wasn't considered.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-06 04:13:16	@kevin_carden such a shame...all of FSU has really gotten the shaft this year. Such a racket!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-06 04:17:48	@kevin_carden Me too! What a disservice has been done to him! Granted, he has made some poor choices, but overall good kid, and great leader
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-06 04:21:30	@kevin_carden Sooo hope he has an incredibly brilliant game against GT!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-07 11:03:35	@Yodez55 @TheEsquireof212 @coachswords Sadly, you don't have enough.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-07 11:08:06	@TheTomahawkChop @redarountree @iamcrzymom We are a family. All of us. Together. #NoleNation
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-07 11:17:38	@CineFunk @RedditCFB Yep. We are the epitome of freshness. #MentosNoles
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-07 11:20:41	@crystnadior And Jameis just smiles.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-07 11:26:00	@harlenshack @DavidBVisser @PatrikNohe @danofero14 @griff_wilcox @JackJorgensen14 Thx for unbiased info.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-07 11:26:47	@rchrdpeacock1 @JOENOLES That's not funny.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-07 11:30:19	@perrykos Well...not everyone. Not me. Or you.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-07 11:31:51	@Noled_Out Champs Always!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 13:21:47	@NolesAndPhins I heard it, but thought it confusing. Maybe a guy thing??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 13:29:45	@jmnpb996 just looked at flights to LAX and Vegas - $650-760 cheapest. Just too much.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 13:33:37	@jmnpb996 I think I paid a little over $600 for last year's ticket; 5 days in Dena with all the trimmings-pretty hefty price tag.&amp;stafium üëé
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 13:36:17	@FSUNOLE21 @jmnpb996 That's what I am shooting for, too...fingers crossed, wallet open.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 13:38:47	@FSUNOLE21 @jmnpb996 how far is that from stadium? Didn't go to OKSTATE game so not sure of area. Assuming need rental car knowing Texas.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 13:40:11	@DonnaDeegan @NolesAndPhins yes. Kind of sounds opposite of "focus" - another Jimboism??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 13:40:51	@FSUNOLE21 @jmnpb996 ok. Sounds good. Will check it out! Thx for tip.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 13:41:49	@DonnaDeegan @NolesAndPhins yes, Bud always seems to know stuff. üò≥
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 13:43:09	@seminolemendy @DonnaDeegan @NolesAndPhins oh! Never thought it might have a literal referent - but still a guy thing I think. :-/!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 13:45:44	@seminolemendy @DonnaDeegan @NolesAndPhins Yep, and betcha $$$ we hear it again before all this is over. üòú
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 13:48:57	@ThePHicks13 @canfish16 @DanielGlauser1 Asking @canfish16?? This answer will be good! #closetohome
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-08 13:50:55	@noleman95 @seminolemendy @DonnaDeegan @NolesAndPhins Totally agree!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-09 17:51:09	@mike_nolesfan @seminolemendy @NolesAndPhins @noleman95 @DonnaDeegan as I said, def a guy thing. Gotta love 'em. :)

302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-09 18:19:08	@FSUeyedoc @Ballou1010xl or maybe both. Or UGA sucks BECAUSE of Pruitt.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-09 23:09:43	@m4ddy what uni thing? Admittedly I am old logo (but new team!), so what am I missing?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-10 00:50:13	@m4ddy yes, I saw. Nike has taken over the CFB world.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-09 18:00:59	@mike_nolesfan @seminolemendy @NolesAndPhins @noleman95 @DonnaDeegan Sisters from another mother.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-09 21:49:18	@melinasphotos Pretty sure that's a good thing. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-10 02:51:34	@idem7 Seriously, have seen it for sale at Seminole store at Hard Rock Casino in Ft Lauderdale.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-10 01:27:44	@davidraider88 Money font.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-10 02:55:09	@idem7 check the Seminole Hard Rock website. Wouldn't be surprised. Btw, whatever happened to the Seminole (tribe) walk on for FSU?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-12 03:43:20	@melinasphotos @ESPNCFB It never stops. #contemptbreedsimmunity

302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-12 03:58:43	@NoleSports @Safid_Deen Does Urban think it's spring???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-12 04:03:08	@ScubaSteve864 Who won...and HOW???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-12 04:08:38	@rchrdpeacock1 @IraSchoffel @redarountree And no matter what happens from here on out we know the struggle has been real, and we are victors
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-12 04:11:05	@m4ddy was that just tweeted randomly??so gross.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-12 04:14:24	@rchrdpeacock1 @IraSchoffel @redarountree To copy you, "Amen!"

302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-12 14:02:05	@YaAlreadyNole @ChristFamNoles I would've passed out if Roberto had won. So used to the hate, don't know how to act anymore. #weknowthetruth
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-12 14:10:23	@NOvieraLE Went to NC game last year; loved Pasadena, but ROSE Bowl itself no. Can recommend Dena motel if interested.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-12 14:14:44	@NOvieraLE Google Saga Motor Inn in Dena. Iconic motel on Rt 66. About 3 miles to RB; inexpensive; old school; nice folks.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-12 14:16:01	@NOvieraLE Do you follow me? Can look up mgr name and DM you.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-12 15:09:00	@bucbolthead @TJ_Pittinger @Jaboowins @TBBuccaneers So has @Jaboowins declared he is going to NFL??? #
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-13 02:00:33	@JR8_Noles @idem7 Thanks for choosing FSU - we are all proud of your accomplishments! Honored to have you representing Florida State.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-13 02:21:07	@Timinole @JTWells4 @JustCallMeNOLE Look at your dog's little feet! Hilariously guilty. Don't let him blame it on the cat!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-13 02:29:28	@seminolemendy Still good!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-13 02:09:20	@ShaneArrington1 @danofero14 @EthanFSUGD I would be thrilled! Been saying all along his Dad him to get a degree-and I think so does Jameis.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-13 03:01:25	@jbrading just had similar thought. Not the gay part, just the bored part.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-13 19:49:30	@SeminoleReverie @cblunt58 Exactly. Bittersweet.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 20:53:40	@sportsmaster18 @SharedaMoment @pcbeachlaw Yes, and I hate what they did to him. Mistakes by him not enough to sabotage kid's college degree
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 21:54:24	@ScalmEm @SharedaMoment @sportsmaster18 @pcbeachlaw I know, just hate they stole his joy - and ours.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 22:18:09	@sportsmaster18 @ScalmEm @SharedaMoment @pcbeachlaw Abdolutely! Was just referring to earlier comment about JW not enjoying it all this year
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 22:18:26	@sportsmaster18 @ScalmEm @SharedaMoment @pcbeachlaw *absolutely!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 22:21:34	@m4ddy Autocorrect uses ME!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 14:27:26	@inauta24 @chrishillfsu We're growing by leaps and bounds, but treat each new member with open arms-#NoleNation is proud to have you!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 16:07:49	@MostlyNoles Thinking more Christmas movies are considered "family movies"? DH series great, but not for young kids. Christmas Story.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 16:09:19	@BostonNoles @Rcarpentieri1 Went to grad school at BC - had to stay true to Noles' colors at least!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 02:34:07	@_MoneyLane @Tbizzle021 So sorry    for this loss of a young man gone too soon. Prayers for peace and comfort for those he left behind.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 02:51:26	@cblunt58 @jbrading well, guess what, Chuck?! No joy in watching it either!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 16:19:31	@FSUArt4Life @floridastate Nice! But disappointed it wasn't done at FSU/UF weekend-quite the "declaration"!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 18:50:00	@cblunt58 "Love, trust, believe...and fight for each other!" No wonder we are 29-0!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 18:54:26	@CHlLDHOODRUINER @crystnadior haha! I think it's my nails! Used to do cool thumbs when I had slideout keyboard...guess that doesn't count ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 19:09:51	@crystnadior this 6 makes it hard to stretch, then auto takes over and then I'm in huge mess...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 19:12:28	@LEX18News County name prolly explains a lot.;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 19:13:49	@FauxPelini @JustCallMeNOLE @YSUsports That's the FIRST thing you do!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 19:22:39	@seminolemendy @Hfaison34 Done. Honored.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 03:13:47	@TJ_Pittinger "I'll be Home for Christmas"
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-17 00:38:39	@ESPNCFB SAYS WHO???!!! YOU, ESPN?? HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-17 00:46:45	@themikegreen54 @larryzimm22 Done!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 16:05:17	@FSUArt4Life @floridastate side note: what happened to lighting of artistic "spear" at rotary intersection near Madison Social??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 16:23:14	@Rcarpentieri1 @seminolemendy So scary. Can you imagine?? Hopefully, never in our Family!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 16:24:45	@Rcarpentieri1 @seminolemendy I would think so!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 16:29:45	@seminolemendy @Rcarpentieri1 Yeah, prolly rumor but I heard they had investigated him for Gville murders that happened during his UF days.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 16:38:21	@seminolemendy @Rcarpentieri1 Again, hope the FSU family never has to suffer with such a person! #notinourhouse
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 16:40:08	@seminolemendy @Rcarpentieri1 AND I'm damn tired of media portraying our school in negative light!! JW is an angel compared to some others!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 16:41:39	@SeminoleReverie I know you're serious, and I get it, but this made me lol
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 17:07:19	@seminolemendy Ok, DONE with Tim Allen!! Guess UM or UF with their true criminal records are not relevant enough anymore...SMH
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 17:10:49	@seminolemendy Yes! I have been holding back on this "embrace the hate" campaign, but beginning to see the light! Slanderous!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 06:50:13	@Tomas_Verde @AUgrad1997 @oanow So sorry to hear of AU's loss.As FSU learned at the hands of a gunman this year, life is precious. #AUnited
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 07:04:42	@NolesVikesMavs Need an ' after raisin'. Or we talking subversive fruit?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 07:06:30	@JohnnyyBoy904 @JustCallMeNOLE Is this about Johnny Football??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 07:13:00	@JeopardySports @not_romo "Who are the FSU Seminoles?" #embracethehate
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 07:28:56	@jasonburns Hard to stay creative! And when you forget...end of the world as we know it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-17 03:26:43	@LowellPoynter @TallahasseeJay @jbrading @TJ_Pittinger @JimSnay Tried, but he is "protected"..,?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-17 03:34:42	@FlaStateGameday Awww...just love this team! Go Noles!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 18:37:44	@cblunt58 Great!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-16 18:38:52	@FSU_Dann Soooo true! #GoNoles !!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 15:06:36	@sportsmaster18 @pcbeachlaw And would LOVE to see this duo extend it into 2016!! #dreamsdocometrue
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 15:11:01	@pcbeachlaw @MichelleDBeadle @SharedaMoment @Andrea_Arneson Scurvy??Seriously?? But what about rickets? Zambouli Fever?How about hoofnmouth?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 15:11:55	@pcbeachlaw @sportsmaster18 @SharedaMoment Perfect scenario for him - and us!! üôè
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 15:14:54	@jbrading Love this!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 15:36:36	@MichaelMills_DC @NolesVikesMavs Lol- I like to be very careful with this one, now that I'm a grandma!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-18 04:10:22	@hymnforrachel @EricLuallen Don't think it was Nick Cannon...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-17 14:46:06	@BushidoNole NEVER, cuz he's real! No presents for you this year!! :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-18 04:17:57	@davidraider88 When we saw 50mile line for shuttle we walked MILES and found cab who dropped us at Old Town bar-not easy!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-18 04:18:59	@CampbellSoop @davidraider88 us too! Bartender there was FSU grad!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-18 04:25:34	@PhenomeNoles Wth's wrong with being a walk-on?? Seems to me a WO would be the hardest-working, most committed player on team #respectearned
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-18 04:27:39	@CampbellSoop @davidraider88 Yes, met him earlier in week and drank there several times. Wife also alum-FSU film school-Hollywood producer!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-18 04:33:11	@PhenomeNoles @davidraider88 @Ranzington @hymnforrachel thinking how much $ I had spent to go home w/loss! Gator near me predicted JW win.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-17 15:18:59	@ESPN_FirstTake @GoCubsGoAP @stephenasmith @Jaboowins NFL can't have him yet. We want him to stay home for another year - or two!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-15 17:29:15	@davidraider88 Welp... That's the kiss of death for sure for the Ewe!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-18 22:55:11	@ChatSeminoles @ChatSports means he stays at FSU one more year to improve off field issues and raise draft status. Please.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-19 01:05:21	@SCSEMINOLES @noleman95 So true.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-20 01:21:42	@LuvDemNoles22 @RG80_ Homored to have watched you play. Once a NOLE, always a Nole!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-18 02:54:50	So my new 6-month long kitchen remodel got totally flooded today by incorrectly connected washing machine. üò∞üò•üòÇüòìüò¢üò§üò±üò©üò´üòñüò°üò°üò°
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 23:15:45	@melinasphotos @osfsu So happy for @Jaboowins!! Great Christmas gift for us all!! And Chanukah!! And Festivus!!! And God bless us everyone!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 23:19:04	@ahaf21 Let me remind you... http://t.co/RnkJBj8KcB
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 02:56:08	@_MoneyLane @jhm8806 We're happy you're happy!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-22 00:52:44	@ScalmEm little tiny voice saying..,I told you so...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-22 00:58:19	@ScalmEm was responding to issue of JW coming back for another year to avoid any/all of that
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-22 09:05:48	@KirkHerbstreit @mswanson @VoiceByTom @rosebowlgame Happy you'll be calling Rose.We need your impartiality and professionalism.Btw-Go Noles!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-22 09:08:52	@headshrunk Jimbo: "I know the truth." Simple, perfect answer to his unwavering defense of Jameis. Good on both of them.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-22 09:22:26	@pound4pound32 @trapj99 Good news does NOT travel fast, if at all!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-22 09:23:52	@pound4pound32 @trapj99 Or blocks you.  :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-22 09:40:24	@Mark_Schlabach @pound4pound32 Just par for the course with so many of today's 'journalists'. Biased isn't a strong enough word.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-22 09:42:54	@pound4pound32 @Mark_Schlabach Don't hold your breath. Did you read the responses by the Fox reporter on that thread? Typical.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-22 09:45:19	@pcbeachlaw @BleacherReport That's what many of us HAVE been doing - or should I say TRYING to do - with no help from media.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-22 13:45:21	@TJ_Pittinger Can u imagine the relief he is feeling?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-22 13:47:17	@idontwan2know @EricLuallen Still, not looking gift horse in mouth. (What an odd saying!)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-22 13:48:00	@TallyNoleJag32 @TJ_Pittinger Ha! Ducks are doomed!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-22 13:51:57	@TJ_Pittinger I assume this whole decision/timing was not part of the overall game plan...but you know what they say about ass-u-me. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-22 13:54:23	@WarchantGene @IraSchoffel And I love this picture. Worth 1000 words!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-22 15:32:18	@trapj99 @pound4pound32 Talking about Schlabach (sp?)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 13:47:18	@Rcarpentieri1 If it weren't so tragic, it would be funny - it's just gotten totally ridiculous on every level.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 13:48:18	@mike_nolesfan Tough job, but someone's gotta do it. Be strong.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 13:50:47	@jmnpb996 Answer to all that:  stay home.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 14:04:53	@mike_nolesfan And I like the shirt on the right. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 14:07:01	@ahaf21 I never look to see follows or un. Just keep moving forward. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 14:15:07	@TropicalNole @ahaf21 yeah, in whole scheme of life your F's or un's aren't really critical.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 14:16:27	@TropicalNole @ahaf21 But don't unfollow or block me for saying so. :-/ ha!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 14:18:17	@shinny006 This! Was just whining about it this morning. Except I won't miss that stadium. #tooiconicforme
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 14:24:44	@DJCURTI5 @shinny006 No!! You did?!?!?! Entrance/exits impossible, concessions/bathrooms impossible; some couldn't see from low seats. :(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 14:27:08	@MojoFishing @DJCURTI5 @shinny006 Yep. Glad I went, but was honestly disappointed in actual stadium; booster tailgate was great,&amp; win!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 14:29:02	@MojoFishing @DJCURTI5 @shinny006 We are spoiled with our beautiful Doak. All we're missing are the mountains!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 14:32:14	@MojoFishing @DJCURTI5 @shinny006 yes! Couldn't drink much cuz needed a passport and hiking gear  for trek to bathrooms
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 14:33:36	agree! #firstworldproblems
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 14:51:27	@noleman95 @DJCURTI5 @shinny006 me too!! Hopefully Pasadena will feel like home to our guys, and we'll take it all home in Dallas!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-21 15:02:17	@noleman95 @DJCURTI5 @shinny006 We can handle ducks. #openseason
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-24 13:58:19	@KilroyFSU @nytimes @JulietMacur I'm tired of fighting this crap. Maybe ignoring will work. No more hits from me. (She said unconvincingly.)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-24 13:59:41	@saintwarrick @GoCubsGoAP @nytimes Becoming their new tag line.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 02:48:48	@MinnySeminole @SpyderFenix Geez. What does it take to get buy-in these days??? If undefeated since middle school doesn't do it, then what?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 02:52:54	@FLSportsJunkie 
Granted, may not be best conduct for role model, but not criminal. Big difference.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 02:58:09	@FLSportsJunkie I totally agree, just saying in hindsight now, he might make different choices since he knows how bright his spotlight is
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 03:01:07	@SpyderFenix @MinnySeminole And he leads that team even when in sweats on sidelines. Of course he needs 10 others-not saying he's superman.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 03:03:22	@FLSportsJunkie and if media had let him live, would've been much easier, but I'm impressed with his strength of character in huge adversity
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 04:40:58	@cblunt58 you can never unsee this. Thx.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 04:48:02	@nolanolegal @GentlemanLawyer @SeminoleReverie excuse my butting in, but did you listen to Cornwell on NBCSports radio today?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 04:49:07	@nolanolegal @GentlemanLawyer @SeminoleReverie thoughts?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 04:51:47	@nolanolegal @GentlemanLawyer @SeminoleReverie Agree! It's like a game between them all. When she makes next move, it's really gonna hit fan
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 04:52:38	@nolanolegal @GentlemanLawyer @SeminoleReverie Yes, even after wearing a hazmat suit
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 04:53:31	@nolanolegal @GentlemanLawyer @SeminoleReverie yeah, but more coming and a bigger fan. Like one of those in airport wind tunnel
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 04:54:16	@GentlemanLawyer @nolanolegal @SeminoleReverie you mean worse. It's already bad. :(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 04:55:06	@FSUNOLE21 @nolanolegal @GentlemanLawyer @SeminoleReverie that's what Cornwell said they'd be forced to do- don't want to, but will HAVE to
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 04:56:59	@nolanolegal @GentlemanLawyer @FSUNOLE21 @SeminoleReverie Cait, not if she continues -
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 04:58:46	@FSUNOLE21 @nolanolegal @GentlemanLawyer @SeminoleReverie Agree! Cornwell said they don't want to but will be forced to if she continues.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 04:59:37	@FSUNOLE21 @nolanolegal @GentlemanLawyer @SeminoleReverie absolutely. And maybe his threat of doing so will stop her??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 05:00:26	@nolanolegal @FSUNOLE21 @GentlemanLawyer @SeminoleReverie yes, but am sure he meant it. What else could he do - roll over??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-24 02:06:27	@TheRealEazy32 Got me. Dang.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-24 02:08:12	@TheRealEazy32 So simple, and so funny. Doesn't take much to entertain us sometimes, does it?! Lol
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-24 02:16:22	@RG80_ Have a great time and a great game!! We'll be cheering for you all the way!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 05:01:23	@FSUNOLE21 @nolanolegal @GentlemanLawyer @SeminoleReverie i hope they do it.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 05:03:23	@cblunt58 @TomahawkNation oh dear. Not very flattering.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 05:05:07	@FSUNOLE21 @nolanolegal @GentlemanLawyer @SeminoleReverie yes, Cornwell made point today that she is being used by her lawyers big time
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 05:08:13	@nolanolegal @FSUNOLE21 @GentlemanLawyer @SeminoleReverie yep, but more like $70mil, or was it $7 mil???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 05:13:49	@FSUNOLE21 @nolanolegal @GentlemanLawyer @SeminoleReverie Not to mention the Aunt or whoever she is
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 05:15:15	@FSUNOLE21 @nolanolegal @GentlemanLawyer @SeminoleReverie Or so she says. Will never forget that park press conference. Embarrassing at best
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 05:18:43	@nolanolegal  Whst rumors?? Share!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 05:31:04	@nolanolegal oh yes, heard that when he left, but thought there was something new
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-23 05:40:38	@cblunt58 @Flastar23 again, things I cannot unsee. My eyes, my eyes!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-26 00:15:32	@rosebowlgame @DJCURTI5 Yikes! Made my heart skip a little beat!! Prolly same thing will happen x 10 in one week! Go Noles!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-26 00:44:12	@dblackburn @NoleSports @Corey_Clark Such am impressive young man! He's been a joy to watch for four years and will be dearly missed!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-26 13:33:00	@dreschenendorf @rocco23noles Is that why my heart skips a beat when I think about kickoff???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-26 13:37:16	@dreschenendorf @rocco23noles Cheer hard for all of us not sitting in that Bowl for second time! Hoping they can do it without me this time!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-26 13:39:06	@dreschenendorf @rocco23noles And tweet to keep us updated! Have fun!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-26 13:40:34	@shinny006 Fill me in when you get the scoop!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-26 13:59:50	@shinny006 @JTWells4 Just looked at some of his TL. Stupidly nuts. Glad we were already asleep. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-26 14:20:29	@JTWells4 @Andrea_Arneson @shinny006 Sad. Nothing better to do in/with his life?? Can't imagine living that way.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-26 14:23:36	@ScubaSteve864 Zaxbys blackened blue salad
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-26 14:35:42	@Meryl_Davis Ha! Thought at first pillow was a Twitter bird! Happy Holidays!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-26 14:58:00	@seminole4life22 @SDS FINALLY, The unbiased truth!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-24 19:28:42	Woman in gift wrap line next to me arguing via cell w/family over dead parents furniture. Merry Christmas.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-26 19:21:49	@PatrikNohe Good on him for making such a wise, but difficult, decision. Much success hoped for him!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-26 19:26:24	@Rcarpentieri1 @tpnolefan1 @PatrikNohe I remember when the NYT was well-respected as a good news source. Sorry for the loss!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-26 19:28:29	@SF_Nole @canfish16 Adorable! Good luck at the Rose! We're behind you all the way!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-26 19:32:29	@Rcarpentieri1 @tpnolefan1 @PatrikNohe Good for that then! Congrats! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 02:25:06	Why do they always seem to try and run where all the players are? Seems like NCS could've run right when he saw the big traffic jam there!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 02:29:25	@rchrdpeacock1 but ability to think on your feet and be creative in face of adversity - so powerful! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 02:30:17	@FSUNOLES1 @csnole and they even put in garnet and gold carpeting. Nice touch!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 02:33:12	@rchrdpeacock1 ah,yes, sadly,the old  Venus and Mars issue once again rears its ugly head...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 02:43:42	@rchrdpeacock1 Maybe. He ran everywhere except into a Super Bowl.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 02:45:41	@SeminoleZack yeah, I don't think that much green is ever good.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 02:48:37	@rchrdpeacock1 Agree. In some ways they just don't make 'em like they used to...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 02:55:17	@ScalpEmAll Hey, guess what? I heard Jameis was coming back.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 03:05:27	@jbrading Cracked me up!! How old is poor Grandma???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 03:08:22	@jbrading yes. Let's not give that nugget any credit for anything! As a grandmother, I so can see this happening though. Still makes me lol!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 03:09:42	@jbrading Gotcha. I'm giving you the credit! He's an ass, plain and simple.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 03:11:58	@shinny006 I WISH I could say me too. :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 03:14:44	@CineFunk Just spent 15 minutes nailing ducks! I'm pretty good!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 03:39:58	@DavidBVisser @ChopChat_ THIS! This is when you knew that the committee was no longer just approaching stupid. They were in downtown stupid.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 03:41:00	@DavidBVisser @ChopChat_ Love this article! Thank you for your clarity and unbiased writing!!!!!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 03:42:16	@Rcarpentieri1 @ChopChat_ LOVE the "downtown stupid" paragraph!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 13:36:28	@NotSureIGetIt2 @harlenshack Agree! It's a beautiful view! Love SD, but you're also gonna love Pasadena!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 13:38:17	@DJCURTI5 So happy you are keeping us updated! Very sad not to be going this year, so thanks!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 13:42:51	@hodakotb Same EXACT smile!! Love it - happy holidays!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 14:59:27	@FSUeyedoc Where ARE you???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 15:11:34	@Blame_Jameis @TomahawkNation @JOENOLES @DeweyKevin @Jmacfsu24 @NikRitter we walked out of stadium for mile, then hailed cab; DON'T Shuttle
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 16:37:53	@DavidBVisser @ChopChat_ My new goal in life: Steer clear of Downtown Stupid.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 16:39:12	@gridironbaby @TheNoleWarrior I've aged considerably this season. Is it wrong that my health depends on Jameis and Crew?!?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 16:46:17	@gridironbaby @TheNoleWarrior Yep! And my doctor would agree!üòÄ
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-27 17:19:19	@DonnaDeegan @reneesbelle @DJCURTI5 @TomahawkNation My Mathis is also interested... http://t.co/vA0ggZf50H
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-28 01:59:12	@unclelukereal1 @jhm8806 U had one job...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-24 21:49:06	@ClemsonTom @nolechick94 When you did the dunk tank @MadisonSocial for @Kidz1stFund ! Merry Christmas!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-28 02:13:30	@Natalie_Pierre I'm glad the players like it...as a fan who has to use a restroom once in a four hour period, not so much! #gimmeDoak
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-28 02:16:09	@FSU_Football @crystnadior I'd venture to $ay thi$ i$ the money car!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-28 02:21:40	@osfsu @crystnadior Hey, @Jaboowins - I don't!!! Win it all, Jameis!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-28 02:28:25	@HeatherSnedeker Actually just came home from oyster roast and low country boil party http://t.co/DHtxyestyF
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-28 02:30:56	@BarrettSallee @jensanti1890 Looks about right to me...nectar of the gods
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-28 02:34:15	@SeminoleReverie I had a friend years before it was the thing, named her baby "O".
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-29 00:23:31	@jmnpb996 very noticeable this year with his freshmen receivers. Good on him for making life lesson out of it.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-28 03:58:59	@RaoJay2 @Safid_Deen That isn't even funny.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-29 01:24:06	@hymnforrachel put lemon in it or limes.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-29 01:27:51	@bart_smith @Hardee11 @rexberg @WillBrinson Soooo disappointed. Expected a big fall!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:16:52	@DeweyKevin @DJCURTI5 I heard somewhere that he did not, but maybe Dallas.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:29:49	@DeweyKevin Just get them to Dallas. Then reinforcements will join you there!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:43:11	@DeweyKevin and up and up and up ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:43:36	@DeweyKevin what row number?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:49:27	@DeweyKevin We were on 74th I think, and only entrance is all the way at the bottom. Celebrate after at Barney's Beanery/bartender FSU alum.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:53:17	@DeweyKevin Nothing's real close. Walk out, then take cab.Bowl in middle of residential area.traffic/shuttle horrendous.or try park close.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-30 23:59:21	@chris_diggity @SECbooger Are NFL folks responsible for drafting players really that dumb? Passing on JW due to media overreaction is nuts.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:04:16	@DeweyKevin @daonlyBigRed What?!?!?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:08:35	I don't know what this says about outcome of the game, but I really don't remember what it feels like to lose. Really.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:13:16	@rchrdpeacock1 No, not at all. Incredulous. Nervous. A little awestruck. Definitely anxious. You?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:19:41	@DeweyKevin @DJCURTI5 Last year they only allowed a sort of sideline run...but no AU eagle at all.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:21:40	@rchrdpeacock1 And a great gift it is! And Im not looking that (gift) horse in the mouth, trust me!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:24:02	@DeweyKevin @DJCURTI5 Agree. Our warriors are going to have to do a lot on their own this year out there. Lots of support from back home tho
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:32:05	@DeweyKevin That's why I'm not returning to Rose, and I regret it.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:35:30	@DeweyKevin You'll have a blast. Just go to the bathroom before you go to your seats. It's a hike. With tons of traffic.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:37:34	@Timinole Well, I would HOPE so! Geez.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:40:20	@DeweyKevin View of mountains from seats is beautiful, and it IS hallowed ground - esp since we won Natty there! GO NOLES!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:58:20	@DeweyKevin good. Just don't park in lots.Took people w/cars hours to get out. Shuttle worse. Ask local ab parking near bowl/walk out to car
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 00:59:15	@DeweyKevin or walk out to find cab maybe.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 01:31:28	@DeweyKevin No prob.just have fun and pull them through one more time. #dallastodallas
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 01:33:14	@DeweyKevin Good luck - tweet us details when you can!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 01:42:11	@FlaStateGameday So proud to say once again, "That's my team!" Met this young man in Pasadena last year w/his mom. said Jimbo paid way.‚ù§Ô∏è
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 01:47:32	@rchrdpeacock1 @FlaStateGameday Just consider the source. No surprise here.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 01:50:12	@fsualumniprez @FSUNOLES1 Nice read. Proud to be FSU.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 04:24:29	@SirSeminole95 Do I guess EVERYBODY wants to play for FSU.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 04:32:15	@bryanDeeds Who cares? We know it happened and we "trust,believe, and love each other."
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 04:28:22	@JR8_Noles @DJCURTI5 Sending prayers and recommendation for LOTS of water. (Mom advice.)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 04:44:30	@LMaez44 Nice.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 04:49:47	@FSUSportsMemes @nolanolegal I like the top left. Priceless. Like the tip-in.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 04:54:44	@perrykos Yeah, evidently everybody wants to play for FSU.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 04:56:57	@perrykos Yeah, think they're finally learning. Teehee
302355508	MeehanLinda	2014-12-31 04:59:38	@frozen1_1906 @moseley_britt @FloydMayweather Along with Jamie Foxx
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-01 12:24:34	@DeweyKevin Getting closer! Yay!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 02:31:55	@RaoJay2 That's not the kind of class I would expect from s winner. Even you.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 02:39:17	@RaoJay2 I agree that was not our finest hour, but your comment was uncalled for, not to mention indicative of a lack of personal integrity.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 02:51:52	@RaoJay2 Listen, sonny, if you're a real Duck, take this win and enjoy it, and stop your whining, name calling, and poor sportsmanship.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 02:52:47	@RaoJay2 In other words, grow up and behave like a winner.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 02:58:35	@RaoJay2 I see by your bio that you're not a Duck, but a S. Florida kid, so I take it all back.Winning, integrity, class-things u don't know
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 03:12:16	@SweepTheLeg337 @TropicalNole Bite your tongue. JW doesn't smoke and if he wants to stay, I'm setting another place at the table.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 03:14:43	@nolechick94 @dannykanell And after an awful loss, proud to see @Jaboowins congratulating Ducks on field.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 03:17:47	@TylerCommaJohn @JTHV But that's what you told me re: JW playing Mariota. Wish THAT had been the truth.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 03:20:08	@LostLettermen Winning with class is not a fowl trait it would appear.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 03:23:04	@TylerCommaJohn @JTHV So wtf happened?! And how was he better than Mariota? Seriously.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 03:30:19	@TylerCommaJohn @JTHV Wish you had been in our watch party. We had several Gataducks there so u can imagine the comments.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 03:34:14	@TylerCommaJohn @JTHV So u think JW will leave for NFL now?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 03:37:15	@JTHV @TylerCommaJohn Actually, I do know a good bit about it, but am not sure JW won't follow his heart.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 03:40:40	@TylerCommaJohn @JTHV I know, but still not totally convinced HE feels ready. For lots of reasons. And why was Jimbo so pissed at him?score?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 03:42:53	@JTHV @TylerCommaJohn I know that's right! I have learned to loathe ESPN.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 03:48:33	@JTHV @TylerCommaJohn Ha! May have to buy Bucs tix next year! Btw, do you know who Enrique Oliu is?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 03:49:04	@JTHV @TylerCommaJohn Perfect.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 03:51:25	@JTHV @TylerCommaJohn Oliu is totally blind Spanish sports announcer for Rays. Former student of mine-amazing kid.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 03:58:11	@Jmacfsu24 @NChen09 @DeweyKevin @JOENOLES You saw an historic game in an historic venue. You supported the best team ever!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 04:01:41	@JTHV @TylerCommaJohn No problemo, just saw u were Rays fan, thought u might. Calls game in Spanish for foreign network using his hearing &amp;
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 04:03:02	@JTHV @TylerCommaJohn wife's vision. Knows EVERY detail/stat of baseball - really amazing, bb genius.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 08:22:18	@thompson_eddie You'll be glad of it tomorrow.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 08:24:36	@thompson_eddie Go for it! Hopefully no wrk tomorrow!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 08:25:48	@thompson_eddie As in military? Re your avi
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 08:27:52	@thompson_eddie well, 2 things: thank you for your service and sacrifice; and 2,sorry our NOLES couldn't make your leave happier with a win.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 08:28:39	@thompson_eddie and 3, enjoy that rum!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 08:31:48	@thompson_eddie Good, honest attitude, but thank you anyway. And focus on the 29, not the 1. We have much to be grateful for-we COULD be UF!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 08:34:00	@NolesJags904 @perrykos the real back breaker was JW's TD not being good imo
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 15:04:00	@TJ_Pittinger @TGMowerman Well, I'll be damned! You're also a mind reader!! Thx for putting MY thoughts on paper so perfectly!! GO NOLES!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 15:12:21	@TheAlbert939913 yes, the bar I was in was all crazy for Oregon's win, but not one green O shirt, hat, scarf, headband, purse, backpack...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 15:16:22	@ShaneArrington1 Obviously didn't watch his own team's exit from the field.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 15:23:05	@SharedaMoment @KirkHerbstreit But then it would be said that Jameis didn't respect officials and went onto field regardless. #ESPNSPIN
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 15:37:38	@DonnaDeegan @LMaez44 That's exactly what I just said! #ESPNSPIN
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 15:45:34	@GoCubsGoAP @TheTomahawkChop @jamesbritt7 @Dalvin_Cook Glad to know that! Thx! Will report.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 16:50:31	@TheTomahawkChop @jamesbritt7 @dalvindjc Just so you know, Dalvin, we see your heart and are proud to support you! Go NOLES!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 16:52:00	@NolesMisty @Mr767inc or Miami or Gainesville or ESPNburg.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 16:53:25	@NolesMisty @Mr767inc Bless your heart!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 16:56:25	@nolanolegal Gotta list this on "best late to work excuses"website
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 17:02:57	Ok, I understand we lost;giving credit to Ducks;proud of our history;all this.BUT,I will not watch another ESPN talk show. Ever.Happier life
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-01 19:28:02	@JR8_Noles Hope you're feeling better. Go get 'em!! Go Noles!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-01 19:29:55	@JTWells4 @Jmacfsu24 @Sarahbelle677 @MikeBrooks @JOENOLES @DeweyKevin Do it right!! Glad you made it - get LOUD!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 08:12:45	@davegladow @nolanolegal Good article, but really-pig nachos?!?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 08:15:00	@nolanolegal @davegladow Not to belabor an aside, but are they like pork rinds with cheese sauce?!?! I can't even...:-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 08:17:29	@nolanolegal @davegladow Well, thank God for small blessings. Now the obvious talents of the writer match his culinary pursuits.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 08:19:01	@thompson_eddie @TheAlbert939913 I know, I was lectured earlier about why it CAN'T happen, but I still want it. Makes me sad to think no.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 08:38:20	@Safid_Deen Won't break my heart if I never hear those two words together again -rose and bowl. Forever separated in my little world.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 08:43:02	@NateAndrews29 @ghostofhypotia You helped get us there, and we are grateful! Be proud,like we are, of you and your brothers.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 09:25:16	@TylerCommaJohn Hey! That's what I said!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 02:10:18	@m4ddy @FSU_Football Me too! Hope you were loud and proud for all of us!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 02:17:31	@DeweyKevin @canfish16 Awesome pic! Congrats and thanks  to "the power behind the throne" for a great two years - and more to come! Noles!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 02:42:54	@TJ_Pittinger hate to hear that happened! So many wackos out there!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 03:03:42	@Moojenowski if you're referring to the car destruction at Doak, please don't call them "fans". No real fan of any team would stoop so low.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 15:18:37	@IGotHART @ChrisThompson_4 We do appreciate all of you! Victorious warriors against other teams and the media!! Honored to support you!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 15:31:27	@TheTomahawkChop @jamesbritt7 @Dalvin_Cook No apologies needed! We know your heart, respect your talent, and are honored to support you.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 15:34:50	@TropicalNole @KirkHerbstreit Honestly think you overreacted re handshake,but don't make it worse by not admitting it happened elsewhere too
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-02 22:38:24	@edsbs Feeling their pain. #Noles
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 00:50:00	@Jaboowins This alum is proud of you, your FSU brothers, and your coaches.Thx for leading us thru 2 glorious years.Good job and welcome home
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 00:51:58	@StevenCollier82 @dalvindjc Agree! He was impressive as a winner, as well as in defeat. That's a true champion and a great Nole!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 01:01:26	@WINole5 @moseley_britt @ChTrickett Give them our best! Once a NOLE, always a Nole!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 15:34:13	@davidraider88 "another hand tentatively goes up"
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 16:52:02	@TJ_Pittinger @_TomBlock While we're at it, how about new tires for my gas-sucking SUV?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 16:53:18	@TylerCommaJohn is it on tv? Network?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 16:55:09	@NolesVikesMavs @TylerCommaJohn Thx. Go ECU!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 02:52:37	@IGotHART I know it hurts, and it's ok to be sad for now.But tomorrow, think about the 29 other games, the titles,awards,the Natty,&amp;b proud!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 02:57:24	@AnthonyValdes33 @Terence_Huie So very sorry! Hope they find who did it-wackos, not real fans of any program! Thank you for representing us!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 03:00:34	@youngjwy @jbrading I'm in - let me know what we can do to help!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 20:19:31	@TylerCommaJohn @jbrading @Brian_Nole @BushidoNole I don't like this talk with Jameis in the room. Stop it.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 20:27:40	@m4ddy me either. And I don't like talking about it in front of Jameis.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 21:51:40	Cam Newton has the prettiest, whitest teeth on the planet.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 21:59:24	@idontwan2know But it's ok to miss him, right?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 22:01:05	@idontwan2know It's hard to let them go - (mother instinct) - even when you know it might be best.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 22:58:28	@idontwan2know I'm still thinking he stays another year. Yes, I'm a girl.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 23:32:24	@FSUNolegurl I've been wondering too. He does look like a robot.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-03 23:35:42	@dreschenendorf @blackburnrobert This. Still relevant. http://t.co/TvOWeiF673
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-05 23:08:25	@jbrading @jmnpb996 @Corey_Clark Is threading the needle not considered accurate anymore?!?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-05 23:23:11	@Andrea_Arn_ Its always worse for mom than kid. I was depressed as hell when we walked into my daughters cubbyhole in Kellum. Heard renos...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 01:51:16	@FSUnoleSC AND can never recreate this moment ever again. Barring major injury(God forbid) NFL will be there for him. Must be tough decision
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 02:08:55	@DJCURTI5 Who knows? But I know I plan to use @DeweyKevin's quote. Like soon. Certainly before next Wake game.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 02:17:48	@FSUnoleSC Yes,knock on wood, don't feel it can get any worse, so maybe he can really enjoy next year at the school he loves.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 02:28:20	@bradleySFR Flat as a pancake.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 02:42:45	@nolanolegal So sorry to hear! Prayers for him. May his mom rest in peace.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 02:53:35	@WarchantBen Oh, I see what you did there. Sneaky. Toying with our hearts.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 02:55:23	@Ranzington @TomahawkNation How do we let it go??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 02:57:08	@DJCURTI5 So that's YOU behind me?!?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 02:59:52	@DJCURTI5 ha! Then there's ANOTHER loud mouth in Doak! Imagine that!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 03:03:53	@ScalmEm @DJCURTI5 row 25 - where r your friends?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 03:05:42	@DJCURTI5 yes, young man behind me is loud enough for our whole section. I usually just shout "what he said" when he stops to take a breath
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 03:10:10	@DJCURTI5 Wish you were in 37 - you sound entertaining!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 03:22:09	@ScalmEm @DJCURTI5 The only other real "character" in our area is a guy who insists on wearing a UM shirt every game. But cheers for FSU.Nut
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 03:23:18	@ScalmEm @DJCURTI5 Hence,thinking of moving next season.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 03:27:12	@GoCubsGoAP @jbrading @DJCURTI5 or a little Bieberish. Sorry.:-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 04:56:39	@FSUnyc @ScubaSteve864 we're going to always be hearing that kind of crap! He's worth it IMO.let them rant!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 05:05:59	@AMFKNole it's hard to know what's "right"-pros and cons on both sides. Really want him to be happy and I think that means he stays.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 05:21:08	Happy 21st @Jaboowins! God bless!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 05:40:30	@NolesVikesMavs That's it. If he stays, I'm quitting Twitter and just enjoying the hell out of watching the GOAT play!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-06 21:06:40	@realshaunking @mICAHbH what about his barber goodbye???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-07 14:15:19	@born2chop That sounds so sad...hope all is better in this new year!‚ò∫Ô∏è
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-07 15:04:37	@born2chop You're welcome.Just remember, we all make mistakes;learn from them, don't regret them. Everything happens for a reason;not cliche
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-07 17:14:52	@Text_N_Tweet and suit talk??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-07 17:18:10	@Text_N_Tweet Always the way when unavoidable meetings! :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-07 17:13:48	So what's happening with JW?? Been in meeting. :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-07 17:16:37	@Text_N_Tweet Interesting strategy. Bet that's not end of it. But no wonder he's gone.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 00:33:24	@TomahawkNation @pcbeachlaw Makes me hope even harder for his success in the NFL.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 00:38:15	@DevinFSU Never forget his obvious charisma on Letterman's Top Ten after Heisman. Kid's gonna be a star!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 18:59:05	@NoleSports @LASeminole Best wishes to Coach Martin for a speedy recovery!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 21:43:33	@BlakeC0 But exciting to see development of new team mentality. Will miss JW and old crew, but that's what makes teaching/coaching exciting!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 21:45:33	@SeminoleZack Me three. Just taking a breather to reload,
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 16:39:38	@Canestzke @MinnySeminole @JOENOLES Haha! Couldn't resist. Those shoes are just horrible. Horrible, I tell you.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 16:41:06	@GentlemanLawyer Seriously, what the hell is this?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 16:42:54	@MinnySeminole @Canestzke @JOENOLES reacting to my earlier tweet I guess
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 16:45:05	@MinnySeminole @Canestzke @JOENOLES tbh I don't even know who Vobb is, was reacting to his FSU comment :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 16:54:45	@Canestzke @MinnySeminole @JOENOLES Gotcha. We'll accept your enlightened cheers at FSU - come be a part of #NoleNation!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 16:57:43	Don't know why it's happening, but I like the "explosion" of my little fav star when I click on it. Is that a bad thing?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 17:02:53	@NOvieraLE Expansion is ok, tacky is not. üòè
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 17:04:29	@FSUeyedoc Awesome.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 17:14:23	@NOvieraLE well, then tacky isn't a strong enough word. These are just plain awful IMO. üò¨
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 19:00:45	@_RobertoAguayo @PhenomeNoles Wonderful news for #NoleNation!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 20:27:38	@PhenomeNoles ICYMI, there are many worse things than being a homer. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-09 06:33:46	@DFsuMitch Find a place to volunteer and help others. Service to others brings many rewards. Best of luck!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 16:30:55	@MinnySeminole @JOENOLES @adidas @Canestzke and the leaves...definitely weed(s). :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 16:34:40	@TylerCommaJohn This is once when his politician talents will serve us well.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 16:36:05	@EricLuallen @PhenomeNoles @adidasFballUS New literal meaning of "Mary Janes".
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-09 07:46:02	@FSUeyedoc @ESPNU @ClemsonTom For some reason I am and watching! Had forgotten how bad first half was!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-08 16:37:37	@Canestzke @MinnySeminole @JOENOLES No shit, Sherlock.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-09 20:45:07	@ddockett @TheDamnBrad @miakhalifa @BraxtonMiller5 Just what we need in Doak.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-11 02:49:58	Good ole Gano!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-09 20:29:14	@_TomLang @SirSeminole95 When is the Camp?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-09 20:43:19	@JR8_Noles And THAT'S the good news - for us!! Hope you have another great year as a NOLE!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-11 16:52:40	@DeweyKevin @TJ_Pittinger I don't even care about watching. At. All.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-11 17:19:06	@DeweyKevin @TJ_Pittinger yeah, me too, but no heart.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-11 17:27:49	@MikeInTampa2 @EAMaddenNFL Just rude.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-11 17:28:51	@davidraider88 Have never known of a title game where I have had less interest.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 19:26:27	@Terence_Huie Miss him. ;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 22:18:31	@dmm5157 @mattynole That's really more what I meant. When you look at some of those JW5 plays, if it weren't for fumbles, we'd b n Dallas.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 22:21:01	@DevinFSU @ESPNCFB This. This is why I can't watch tonight. Def will mute my volume.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 22:49:09	@mattynole @dmm5157 yes, and that's part of my complaint as well. Treated like stepchildren all season by EVERYONE, esp Committee,all wrong!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 22:52:57	@AMFKNole @KilroyFSU Who's Ryan Leaf?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 22:54:16	@AMFKNole @KilroyFSU um, sorry...yes.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 22:57:55	@AMFKNole @KilroyFSU whew! Not knowing that isn't so bad then, huh? But  whatever his #, JW5 won't be forgettable by anyone IMO.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 22:59:35	@KilroyFSU @AMFKNole Thx for info. Don't think Jameis will fit that profile no matter what # he goes.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 23:01:33	@celebrityhottub wth is that all about? An Irishman with a grilled chicken sandwich???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 23:03:36	@Safid_Deen And we wonder why some of these boys have trouble on the college scene. God bless her for changing lives with kindness!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 23:11:48	@NolesVikesMavs not seriously or with any heart.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 23:15:44	When you think about either team winning tonight, and what happens with just one letter change...Yep,how I feel about our new 'champions'.üò°
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 23:24:51	@Corey_Clark Thank God, and thank YOU for writing this truth!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 23:29:28	@SPRINGBR3AK98 soundsike tornado weather
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 23:31:25	@Corey_Clark Makes tonight's game a little more palatable, too.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 23:35:37	@Timinole too far for us to go, so no!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 23:40:58	@SPRINGBR3AK98 No better way to go for all of you.üòÖ
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 04:18:12	@jmnpb996 and you do know that baby carrots are washed with chlorine, so be careful; some think they're not healthy.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-13 02:49:35	@LuvDemNoles22 but is it just me, or is this boring?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 12:39:25	Missing the Chiefs on Today Show! #wewereallrobbed
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 12:53:01	@noleman95 Absolutely agree. I know I'm prejudiced, but really, REALLY don't feel they are 2 best teams. Really.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 12:57:00	@noleman95 Yes, but don't think I can get over Urban Cry-er being the champ coach. That would be all kinds of wrong.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 12:59:17	@GoCubsGoAP Lol. Sooo don't want either be to win!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 13:00:29	@cje2510 I'm resorting to HGTV.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 13:10:06	@FSUWarpath No interest here. Don't want either one to win. Or both losing would be nice.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 13:22:02	@KilroyFSU OSU??? Eesh...Urban Cryer?? Just can't even.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 13:23:46	@noleman95 Yes, there is all that. Which is why I want them BOTH to lose.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 13:29:25	@noleman95 Sore loser here. üò°
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 13:30:11	@KilroyFSU But if he wins...yuck.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 13:30:53	@FlaStateGameday @Jaboowins GOAT
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 13:33:10	@noleman95 Thanks! I'll take it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-12 13:40:25	@MadisonSocial @StephArmour1 Knowing all the talent at MadSoc, I imagine you could pull off both. üòâ
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-13 03:44:05	@TomahawkNation Where was this OSU team all season?! Did the Committee ignore them too until very end??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-13 03:45:38	@Sportsgirl917 ohhhh! Gotcha! Perfect reason...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-13 03:50:14	@Sportsgirl917 yeah, they were wrong about pretty much everybody every week including tonight! Ha!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-13 04:32:44	@hymnforrachel yes, and because they've all been wrong about everybody every game all season!! #epicfail
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-13 04:34:30	@davidraider88 You're not showing best part of that pic.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-13 04:37:15	@Yoshi20 @JTHV Not THIS Heisman winner.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-13 05:03:19	@davidraider88 @WinTheDay NOW who's giving up????
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-13 05:32:14	@noleman95 You got your wish!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-13 05:32:52	@danofero14 yeah, but he is.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-13 05:34:58	@OsceolaNole typical gatorcryer move.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-13 05:37:04	@MinnySeminole typical gatorcryer move I tell you.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-13 05:38:27	@noleman95 yeah, who gave up tonight?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-14 02:38:32	@Noles247 what's the date of the draft? And are these FSU players done with FSU now? Like off campus, out?gone? How does all this work??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-14 03:02:19	@mattynole @Noles247 Thx. So when is the draft? And who/where is JAmeis training?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-14 03:11:54	@mattynole @Noles247 Never heard of him, but that's just me. Thx for info.When you say "starts",how long does it last?thot it was 1 night?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-14 15:59:35	@m4ddy My daughter! Sat.venues were booked, so we opted for a Friday and find that many guests prefer it esp out-of-towners who sightsee.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-14 16:02:41	@m4ddy yes, guests have to plan a day off, but in our tourist town which has become destination wedding mecca, it's become a real choice.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-14 16:07:31	@m4ddy yes, we found that it really works esp in a tourist area. We have over 25 weddings per weekend in St Aug! Crazy-esp for us locals!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-14 16:08:59	@m4ddy Hope your fianc√© can get a day off - will give you s fun weekend! Our guests are invited to after-wedding brunch on Saturday morn
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-13 23:11:11	@SBNation Well, it sure makes one question his sportsmanship, though, doesn't it?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-13 23:49:52	@KilroyFSU is that your sarcasm font I assume??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-14 23:58:09	@DJCURTI5 @Rcarpentieri1 I'm a sucker for a good slot machine!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-15 00:02:34	@Rcarpentieri1 @DJCURTI5 But seriously, will he do well there? Support from others on team? Any other good talent on team???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-15 00:03:22	@DJCURTI5 @Rcarpentieri1 Sounds like a win-win for sure!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-15 00:09:55	@DJCURTI5 @Rcarpentieri1 you must understand, I am in Jags country and am a little jaded about "rebuilding".
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-15 00:13:17	@Gotham3 @stpete2you I thought it WAS Nicholas Cage!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-15 00:14:30	@gridironbaby @DJCURTI5 @Rcarpentieri1 O line is pretty crucial to the QB doing great, tho
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-15 00:27:18	@Jaboowins You will be missed by all of #NoleNation, but God bless for much success in the NFL. Just remember-once a Nole,always a Nole!‚ù§Ô∏èüíõ
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-15 00:40:54	@MajorNews911 @EricTheNole @WJXTvic whoa. Close to home.:(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-15 00:44:34	@EricTheNole Thx. About 30 miles from me, but have eaten there many times! Nice little family restaurant on River.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-15 00:57:17	@moseley_britt @Jaboowins Yep, would be worth a little drive for me too!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-15 00:58:44	@KiefOsceola @DJCURTI5 I feel a little sorry for the guy. Notice the fourth word in that sentence.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-14 00:20:18	@MOTS_3 It should have been!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-16 02:47:04	@FSView Excellent! And we all can identify-remembering where we were,who we were with, &amp; how we felt in the presence of greatness. Thx to 5.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-16 02:48:29	@nolanolegal @BushidoNole Learned it in the swamp.

302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-23 22:57:02	@flbeachdad Awesome!! I'm sure she will get one!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-23 23:01:26	@flbeachdad FSU would be lucky to get her!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-01-23 23:04:08	@flbeachdad well, you know what they say, "everything's bigger (and better) in Texas!" But we know that FSU is the best! Hope she gets in!

Pasadena. Loves my daughter.

302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-11 04:11:33	@meg_fresh Sounds like my daughter. She started going to AU games with him when Cam was there. They try to do some of both each season.

302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-11 04:19:29	@seminolemendy @SirSeminole95 I meant that I'm about the same age as the old logo, not my future son-in-law! Hahahaha
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-11 04:23:21	@seminolemendy @SirSeminole95 Yes, and good friends with his parents as well. We are lucky!

302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-22 04:29:11	@NOvieraLE @Andrea_Arn_ but almost never decided!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-22 04:31:12	@NOvieraLE @Andrea_Arn_ partly, and I kept adding things, so not all contractors fault. Last min decision to put in all travertine floors

302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-22 04:34:04	@Andrea_Arn_ @NOvieraLE yes, alm did Quartz until I found this...fit my sage green scheme of house
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-22 04:35:41	@NOvieraLE @Andrea_Arn_ I love that! My old kitchen was black and white. Can go with alm any accent color

302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-22 04:40:32	@NOvieraLE suggestion: I went with all one level bar/peninsula instead of upper like I had, &amp; love it! Saw my friend's -Opens room wide!

302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-23 02:59:20	@FSUNOLE21 I liked it! Let her live! At least she said something!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-23 03:00:46	@FSUNOLE21 Not the point. They're both women probably.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-23 03:02:27	@FSUNOLE21 Totally disagree. That's the person with a voice. At least she's speaking up and that's more than most do.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-23 03:06:10	@FSUNOLE21 not following you at all. Usually agree w/ you re: FSU. She used her platform to speak out against injustice. What's wrong w/that
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-23 03:09:18	@FSUNOLE21 I get that part, but spokespeople come from all walks-can't deny the truth of her statement just cuz she's in an expensive dress.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-23 03:12:26	@FSUNOLE21 Maybe, but doesn't destroy the truth of what she said. Don't have to like her, just agree with principle behind the statement.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-23 03:15:41	@FSUNOLE21 Ok, we will just agree to disagree on this.when I said have to, meant if you believe in what she said, agree regardless of her.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-23 03:28:43	@Corey_Clark Agree. Boring and silly.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-23 03:31:55	@hymnforrachel Ain't that the truth?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-22 20:04:57	@shinny006 @Rcarpentieri1 @TropicalNole I don't believe in before photos of any part of my anatomy. Ever.period. Case.Closed.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-22 20:05:37	@Phillips your Anthem was awesome!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-22 20:08:22	@shinny006 @Rcarpentieri1 @TropicalNole Regardless. No. Befores.Ever. Trust.Me.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 15:16:02	@PhenomeNoles now, see? Here I am agreeing with you again. ;) just won't mention Patricia Arquette. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 15:21:47	@ChopChat_ And isn't it about time these folks believe what we've been saying about @Jaboowins since the Pitt game?! Go Jameis!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 15:23:45	@MikeInTampa2 Bucs would be smart to sneak Rashad in there somewhere!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 15:31:49	@MikeInTampa2 gotcha. Just don't miss him. He's the best.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-23 05:06:13	@KySportsRadio He was bad this year.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 17:45:48	@SeminoleReverie So very sorry. Prayers for all of you.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 17:48:34	@shinny006 I retired last June after 43 years at same establishment. And it's wonderful! Coffee w/Matt Lauer every morning in my pj's...‚ò∫Ô∏è
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 17:56:39	@shinny006 yes, enjoy it all! It flew by and I still can't believe all that time has passed. It helps to love what you do.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 17:59:27	@AMFKNole @ChopChat_ Maybe she finally accepted he had serious gf, and wasn't interested.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 18:00:09	@AMFKNole @ChopChat_ Woman scorned...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 20:47:56	@SeminoleReverie I have iPhone 6 and like it. 6+ was too big for me.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 20:49:56	@SeminoleReverie No, and I use it for everything. Camera is good. Sure that it does much more than I know. #toobusytolearn
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 20:51:47	@SeminoleReverie came to this from a 4, so much better. And much longer battery life.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-23 21:35:35	@NolesVikesMavs Not "iffy", just plain "awful".
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 02:27:32	@MrWarchant @Noled_Out I seriously LOVE the fact that the naysayers are flipping.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 02:29:23	@nolanolegal @PhenomeNoles we went ethnic- my girls are Irish names like their clannish cousins.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 02:30:52	@nolanolegal @PhenomeNoles I love Caitrin! My girls are more typical - Erin and Maureen.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 02:34:22	@nolanolegal @PhenomeNoles omg! WHY??? I think it's really lovely and unique. Middle name?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 02:36:57	@nolanolegal @PhenomeNoles Well, I really like Caitrin - and that's what I would call you full out. My granddaughter is Kaitlyn Grace(Kait).
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 02:41:19	@nolanolegal I'm sticking with Caitrin just like I call my grand her full name. Funny @PhenomeNoles can't find name he doesn't hate.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 02:46:51	@MrWarchant @Noled_Out Totally agree. Finally admitting what we've known all along about our boy. #5vindicated
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 03:15:21	Why did I record crybaby Bachelor? And why am I watching it?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 03:16:33	@TropicalNole it really is one of the most ridiculous shows on tv. Train wreck calibre.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 03:21:50	@TropicalNole good on you. Can't look away once you tune in. Definite train wreck.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 03:29:52	@FSUWarpath Why do I watch this trash?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 04:27:18	@TGMowerman @TropicalNole Just to confirm your judgment, tonight was particularly heinous.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 04:32:15	@TGMowerman @TropicalNole now, that can't be any better! Must be the naked part, huh?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 04:36:35	@TGMowerman @TropicalNole maybe I'll tune in -can't take any more of the whining bachelor.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-24 04:55:18	@ahaf21 and summer seems a long way away when you're sick! Feel better!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-25 02:20:04	@SeminoleReverie you will love the 6, then. Fits in all but my smallest clutch bags, and that's with a good cover(it is very skinny).
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-02-25 02:21:23	@SeminoleReverie and I bought the glass protective cover...dropped it in Home Depot, and cover shattered, but not glass or phone.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-02 03:29:51	@ahaf21 Do you take a good probiotic? It helps!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-02 03:34:07	@GoCubsGoAP I have never read the comics, but Darryl was cracking me up tonight.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-02 03:36:12	@GoCubsGoAP oh no! He's my fav!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-02 03:43:44	@NickWaisome @RossyNole10 me too - don't know nothin bout no comics!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-02 03:44:14	@RossyNole10 Don't even say that out loud!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-02 03:45:36	@mike_nolesfan Don't trust it at all!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-02 03:53:18	@DavidBVisser I predict this will not end well. Carol has a plan.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-02 14:33:02	@mike_nolesfan Yes, and Deanna is a politician. Nuff said.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-02 14:36:22	@mike_nolesfan yeah, this is going to be slower and more subtle-terminus went downhill fast!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-03 05:19:41	@Moojenowski Almost bit on one of those today! Close one.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-03 05:22:18	@ajlacy95 @SirSeminole95 I hate you.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-03 05:33:07	@ajlacy95 yes, but you shouldn't scare grandmas like that, son. :-/
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-03 05:38:02	@ajlacy95 too late now! Lol
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-02 03:25:23	@GoCubsGoAP "We brought dinner."
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-02 03:35:47	@GoCubsGoAP really thought you meant comedic scenes...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-02 03:37:02	@DavidBVisser Darryl was priceless tonight.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-02 03:54:40	@MTeplicek No worries. Carol's on to all of them.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-03 02:40:56	@melinasphotos That old glass ceiling is still there, huh? Damn.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-05 02:02:40	@Noled_Out Loved Rooster beating those snooty Gators in 98 - especially when it was so unexpected! Marched in the streets after game-gr8!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-05 02:07:57	@VALadyNole Definitely made me laugh.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-06 21:18:46	@moseley_britt I had no idea why all this was/is true, but I just knew it. Thanks for the confirmation.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-04 03:14:22	@DoakSCampbell what happened now?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-04 03:16:32	@jbrading like a double-over handed negative with spin.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-04 03:19:33	@jbrading I'm an old English teacher and I've seen plenty of screwed up syntax, but this was one of the best...or worst.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:21:16	@hymnforrachel I can top all that- I was a peace child protesting the war in Vietnam and thought sororities were ridiculous.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 01:53:05	@Text_N_Tweet yeah, Carols gonna eat her.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 01:53:47	@JoshOz76 Whst about Carol?! She's not exactly sane either.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 01:56:45	@JoshOz76 I think they're all going to turn bad and make the new peoe look even more ' normal'
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 01:57:25	@Text_N_Tweet Yep. A little extra chocolate. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 01:58:23	@JoshOz76 see! Now Tuck is turning soft - they're all going to become the opposite of what they were.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:01:48	@Text_N_Tweet a They're all losing it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:02:30	@JoshOz76 on the contrary, maybe Sasha is the only sane one!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:04:26	@JoshOz76 Yep, and think about it. Each character is doing opposite of the past. Weird, for sure.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:06:09	@ColJE10 I was done when Buttons got it.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:07:07	@mike_nolesfan And me too.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:07:55	@hymnforrachel Ricks going over the edge.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:08:33	@mike_nolesfan Yep, he's losing it too.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:10:16	@mike_nolesfan yes! They're all going the opposite of where they were.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:11:05	@JoshOz76 Is that what the stamp is all about?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:16:17	@JoshOz76 ha! I was thinking (A)rmy and (W)alker!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:18:45	@CJVeryNole Junior League going rogue!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:25:36	@shinny006 Its that Junior League training. #brutal
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:27:37	@shinny006 They are all going over the edge...Shawna, Rick, Darryl, definitely Carol...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:28:56	@DavidBVisser Yeah, that was way too much.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:44:19	@GoCubsGoAP Ha! Yeah, now used to smashed heads of gross people with rotting skin, but a horse?? C'm on, man!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 02:46:50	@nolechick94 and how easily they took him down. Hated it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-09 13:56:43	@idem7 Every time I read your name, it makes me laugh.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 01:11:19	Glenn is history. #TheWalkingDead
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 01:30:05	@shinny006 she is done with cookies!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 01:30:56	@hymnforrachel she's my new fav too! #realcarol
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 01:37:45	@hymnforrachel what was Aidan saying??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 01:38:16	@CJVeryNole what was that Aidan saying??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 01:40:54	@CJVeryNole what was he saying before he got eaten? Couldn't understand him
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 01:43:39	@m4ddy I'll never look at revolving doors the same again
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 01:51:18	@CJVeryNole And now Glenn lost his friend. Dang
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 01:52:18	@m4ddy Sick, and notin a good way. At all
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 01:53:06	@CJVeryNole I'm with you. Last week, the horse; this week...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 01:54:39	@CJVeryNole I know!! Hate this.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 02:14:26	@JoshOz76 interesting. What was it Carol said to Rick about the situation when she first told him? I was missing lines everywhere tonight!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 02:15:30	@JoshOz76 hmmm. True. Anyway, shits about to hit the fan in Alexandria.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 02:15:58	@JoshOz76 did she use the word abuse?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 02:18:21	@JoshOz76 I thought she said something about "chains"...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 02:19:16	@JoshOz76 me too
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 02:21:21	@thetalkingdead was the death of the innocent horse a precursor of the innocent Noah's death??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 02:26:31	@CJVeryNole yes, very sad. The beginning of his Alexandria was really his end.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-16 03:53:10	@JoshOz76 all of that. Plus Carol uses Darryl's crossbow on Sam.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-15 19:53:31	Truth. http://t.co/s1oKnFwTDf
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-19 02:09:31	@VALadyNole Will lift him-and you- up in prayer.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-19 02:11:40	@Timinole i loved the Newsroom! Is it back on now?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-19 02:13:38	@Timinole Dang. You got me all happy for nothing.;(
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-19 02:15:11	@saintwarrick love that he's too fast for them. Our secret weapon no one can figure out.;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-19 02:17:35	@nolanolegal Ha! Thing is, I understand every word. Just like I did with the indecipherable JW.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-19 02:19:34	@osfsu @TheDamnBrad I believe the term was "flashed" at him.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 16:27:32	@harlenshack Don't tell me!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 16:28:44	@MichaelMills_DC might not be upside down if body is already down on ground
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 16:30:58	@NotActuallyJake @harlenshack Who is Negan? Don't tell me if it's going to give away plot.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 17:41:16	@rchrdpeacock1 yeah, way wrong. On so many levels.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 18:13:22	@rchrdpeacock1 "do not admire" would be a very nice way of putting it. üòù
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 16:35:37	@garnetgoldmike @JustCallMeNOLE ha! I look at my picture taken under the Rose Bowl score board. National Champs.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 16:37:29	@harlenshack I am soooo wanting this all to turn out well, but after the horse went down...Welp, it's all over isn't it??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 16:45:30	@SeminoleReverie when in doubt, get both. Each one is adorable.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 16:48:05	@SeminoleReverie you're welcome - we very rarely NEED outfits, mostly WANT. üòâ so indulge!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 02:14:41	@Text_N_Tweet never read the comics - would hate to know what's coming up! Like the suspense - but what's the "w"? (Don't tell me!)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 02:16:45	@ColJE10 he's better on here than on show. Kinda like him now.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 02:18:37	@ColJE10 I know. He always drives me nuts. And that damn hat...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 02:20:45	@ColJE10 when they showed it tonight, it looked like a revolutionary tri corner thing - it's about had it.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 02:22:42	@Text_N_Tweet she was saving him. From himself.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 02:49:23	@ahaf21 don't beat yourself up over it - most people make salads unhealthy by drowning them in unhealthy dressing.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 02:51:25	@MichaelMills_DC or is it an "M" for Morgan?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-23 02:56:32	@Text_N_Tweet can't believe it's almost over again!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-27 01:24:32	@gridironbaby if you're staying 2 nights, check the Tallahassee Center. Condos at Kleman Plaza. Free parking in their garage too
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-27 01:30:25	@gridironbaby studios up to three BR condos. Might be rented out to legislators nut worth a shot. Ask for Leslie.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-27 02:38:04	@shinny006 Was that same day we retired previous Renegade? That was a beautiful and emotional day in Doak! http://t.co/cpiZA9C992
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-27 02:53:29	@rchrdpeacock1 @shinny006 Guess it's true that time flies when you're having a good time, and it's always a good  time in DOAK!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-27 02:59:07	@rchrdpeacock1 @shinny006 And I would even venture to say even a losing day in Doak is better than a winning day in any other stadium.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-28 01:45:49	@SeminoleReverie and the same with NEVER putting a new toilet paper roll on the spindle. NEVER. It's a little thing for Gods sake. Never.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-28 01:47:12	@SeminoleReverie I hate them all.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-30 01:10:05	@MichaelMills_DC Don't Ya just love it when a plan comes together???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-30 01:30:15	Glenn's going down.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-30 01:36:56	@crystnadior Death wish.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-30 01:38:08	@Phillips Darryl's losing it. Even I knew the trailers were full of zombies!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-30 01:55:24	@amestheledge Soooo the map means...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-30 01:58:02	@amestheledge I think Rick gave it to somebody at the church but I can't remember who ???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-03-30 02:19:13	@nolechick94 didn't show it. But glad he did!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-01 02:02:40	@MichaelMills_DC just saw this. I'm a little lost as I don't read the comics, but I think Morgan is going to be the savior for them all.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-01 02:05:04	@saintwarrick üò¢ gonna miss that big kid.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-03 05:14:45	@MichaelMills_DC Long live The Prince!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-03 05:30:10	@nolanolegal just saw this - congratulations! Love her name!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-03 05:34:41	@nolanolegal only a mom with a new little one would be up at this hour favoriting tweets!;) Enjoy her - my youngest gets married soon.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-03 05:36:02	@nolanolegal it all happens too quickly. Daughters are such joy.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-09 02:03:37	@TheMasters @jacknicklaus Lot of talent on that family! Go Jack and Go Noles!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-10 00:00:38	@danofero14 @FoxNews He used to wear FSU gear in his movies all the time - love it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-10 00:09:25	@jhm8806 please no!!!!! I can't get to Tennessee , but Tampa is doable!!! C'm on Bucs!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-10 01:32:03	@jhm8806 I figured that- but you can't have him! We want to keep JW in Florida, even if it is Tampa. (Sorry to say I'm a Jags fan.)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-13 02:00:29	@eireryn And tripled in size!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-13 02:01:39	@idontwan2know Or a bull horn. A big one. Made out of no -flammable material.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-13 02:04:31	@ThePHicks13 Hope it also means Mark May is out. Really don't like him.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-13 02:06:08	@TheAlbert939913 and I hope he takes Mark May with him.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-13 02:08:21	@ThePHicks13 And he was so hateful about Jameis. Such a hypocrite.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-14 01:06:35	@JR8_Noles Get him, Jalen! If not now, better yet - next game! Go Noles!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-14 01:17:47	@Jmacfsu24 Found a HUGE frog IN my Keurig coffee holder on my kitchen counter! His eye blinked &amp; I nearly fainted! http://t.co/6cAwCnwt9q
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-14 01:25:12	@rchrdpeacock1 @SassyNole @Jmacfsu24 Agree, but sadly just me-carried it out to pool deck screaming and poor frog jumped 8 ft into deep end!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-14 01:32:53	@rchrdpeacock1 hahahaha!! Definitely by trespass - I mean how the heck did he.find that spot?!?! Can't even!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-14 01:37:47	@rchrdpeacock1 Yeah, sneaky little suckers. No manners.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-20 03:45:39	@rchrdpeacock1 however, one can learn a lesson from such dances, &amp;might think twice before jumping back on the dance floor.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-20 02:13:17	@melinasphotos Amen to all of the above!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-20 02:20:23	@rchrdpeacock1 and Brennan would know, of course.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-20 02:44:04	@rchrdpeacock1 is that an indirect Brennan quote? I thought so.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-20 02:50:11	@rchrdpeacock1 Sad, but that is how she seems to think. Can't remember a more polarizing tale than the JW College Years Saga. Ever.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-20 03:15:06	@rchrdpeacock1 I think you should keep that in the present tense tho.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-20 03:15:27	@rchrdpeacock1 unfortunately.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-20 03:18:10	@rchrdpeacock1 still am shocked at the venom in some people plus a lack of compassion, intelligence, and fairness. Very scary combination
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-20 03:27:41	@rchrdpeacock1 what a difference in two lives was created by one wreckless night. Not to mention the ripple effect.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-20 03:37:44	@rchrdpeacock1 you just never know. Risky Business.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-20 03:39:19	@TGMowerman yes, and a dangerous loser
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-20 03:40:43	@rchrdpeacock1 not sure I can relate that analogy to this scenario, even with a ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-20 03:46:08	@rchrdpeacock1 Or at least choose a better dance partner
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-20 03:52:53	@rchrdpeacock1 so right-not until they get burned, and he's still fighting the flames. I'd say he's learned that lesson for sure.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-23 04:22:43	@jimmyfallon Thx a lot, Jimmy! Now I can't stop singing-"balls in your mouth, balls in your mouth...don't swim in the ocean, you'll get..."
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-23 04:34:50	@BlackBrandon @TheDamnBrad I really really hope he gets lots of $$$$$$!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-22 14:25:23	@FlaStateGameday JW definitely has the "touch"....nothing but net!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-27 17:57:33	@TropicalNole @Jaboowins It was such a great run! Thanks for leading the way. #FSUforever
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-27 18:10:08	@PatrikNohe Same old story. How long can she go on, really???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-30 13:31:33	@NoleSwag2732 @hymnforrachel Already looking for Bucs tix.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-30 13:38:14	@StevenCollier82 The way most of media and public  have treated him, I'm glad he's staying home to celebrate with those who have supported
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 01:51:12	@Bro_Pair @BobbyBigWheel @darrenrovell Don't know you, but this makes me like you.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 01:56:14	@mgl_8 Never followed the Bucs, but guess who just bought a block of 10 tix for my FSU tailgate crew to see my QB beat Cam Newton?!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 01:57:59	@mgl_8 look on seat geek. Just bought end zone, but will be fun to see our boy play again!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 02:03:53	@RobertKlemko And I hope you don't like music...
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 02:06:17	@JoeBucsFan @CStephMM Trinity reference? ;-)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 04:14:28	@ahaf21 He loves life - what's NOT to like?! Some people just don't get it, and have no clue how to be happy. Just.Plain.Happy.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 04:17:25	@TomahawkNation You're good, Bud, but our QB is just a ketchup cup full of coke better. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 04:18:39	@pcbeachlaw @adown15 @Jaboowins What a great keepsake! Glad we knew him "when"!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 04:22:22	@idontwan2know Not this one. I love it!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 04:24:44	@alexmathis @moseley_britt @espn @nflnetwork Had an interview afterwards outside. Switched over after NFL coverage and caught it.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 04:31:13	@nolanolegal @TomahawkNation @smartfootball And she's cutting him a little slack just for his big night. Doubt it happens often. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 03:18:21	@harlenshack and why not Rashad???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 03:20:01	@nolechick94 And he was dressed so classy! Gotta love him!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 03:27:46	@harlenshack Just never like seeing UM get one up on us. I'd still pick #80. Where will he end up you think?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 04:02:12	@melinasphotos Need a camera holder, Melina??? I can make myself available!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 04:08:19	@melinasphotos @dolfan565 Not worthy of a response. Jealousy is a bitter pill @dolfan565.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 04:12:19	@JeanValjameis Except none of the doofuses on camera had an Instagram account and no clue how to get one. Typical.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 13:04:45	@moseley_britt @alexmathis @espn @nflnetwork  yes, he did! Just more evidence of his good character.Then saw his fun side in Instagram pic;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 15:22:31	@PatrikNohe Thx. Saw an article today that it's over $22 million. So happy for him and his family! He deserves every penny IMHO!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 15:23:48	@crabwizard So YOU were the "Capt" referenced in Jameis' Instagram photo last night. Sweet.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 15:29:47	@SBNationCFB Everyone always thinks the worst! Damn, they need to get a life and let our QB ALONE!!!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 15:32:07	@CollegeSpun @ClemsonTom Thank you for confirming what his supporters already knew.The kid has a great heart, &amp; is not the villain most see!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 15:33:41	@JCameronShow What else is new????
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 15:35:04	@rchrdpeacock1 And he gets the last laugh with a great contract and good $$$$$$$!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 15:40:02	@rchrdpeacock1 Yep. Looking forward to seeing him move forward in the NFL. Already got tix to see him against Cam Newton in October.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 15:42:47	@rchrdpeacock1 ha! Been supporting him since the Pitt game! So I guess you're right!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 15:46:34	@rchrdpeacock1 Yes, but we both know the Satan part is bogus. I think he picked #3 as reference to Holy Trinity. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-30 13:17:39	@GoCubsGoAP About time there's some decent press regarding our QB!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 16:42:04	@rchrdpeacock1 you make me laugh! Have a great day!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 16:53:04	@wayhogan Count me in the "love" column. And so I'll try to like the Bucs. Go Noles!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-02 03:50:30	@93_99_13Noles I know! This sounds awfully mean, but he's just bland!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-30 23:08:27	@TheDamnBrad when are they going to show JAmeis party??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-30 23:09:57	@NoleFan06 maybe they're $ettling?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-04-30 23:10:32	@TheDamnBrad so not showing on ESPN or NFL?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 01:43:52	@ahaf21 just got my first Tampa Bay tix - Jameis vs Cam Newton! Should be a good showdown!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 01:45:01	@PatrikNohe I'm watching NFL channel.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 02:24:59	@LostLettermen Gotta love him.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 02:27:46	@HeatherSnedeker they can do that??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 03:59:56	@Warchant Here's a ? How much are they paying JW?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-01 04:04:26	@PatrikNohe has it been reported what kind of money JW will be paid by Bucs?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-03 02:02:20	@rchrdpeacock1 @AFalconFanatic Why do you think he'll be out in 4 years @AFalconFanatic ??
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-03 02:18:18	@AFalconFanatic @rchrdpeacock1 Well, I would HOPE you don't hate him since it is obvious you do not even know him.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-03 02:19:56	@AFalconFanatic @rchrdpeacock1 And based solely on these comments from you, so am I.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-03 02:24:17	@AFalconFanatic @rchrdpeacock1 You are not worth any more of my valuable time. No patience with ignorance and rudeness. Have a great life.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-03 02:34:24	@AFalconFanatic @rchrdpeacock1 Based on your avi, doubt you are best judge of what's logical. Or anything else for that matter.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-03 14:34:58	@Rad_Stache Now THIS is funny! Couldn't agree more!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-03 14:40:57	@Noles247 @Jaguars Great. Now I gotta follow Bucs AND Jags! My Sundays are getting complicated. #NoleNation
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-04 22:17:00	@FlaStateGameday @Browns @ConorOrr So glad to hear this! He's a great young man and would be a wonderful addition to any NFL team!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-07 05:41:48	@Andy_Staples So I watched your #askandy video clip, and couldn't believe how YOUNG you are! For some reason, thought u were old dude!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-09 23:14:24	@DavidBVisser @TomahawkNation good for you! Enjoy your writing so will look forward to more with TN!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-09 23:27:01	@cajunger @ColJE10 @thedailybeast or chiffon for sure. Def not wool or cotton.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-09 23:28:39	@DonnaDeegan @THEPLAYERSChamp I'll be there! I'll be the one in pink.;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-10 00:27:42	@DonnaDeegan Would love to! I'll look for you - thanks! Who are you pulling for? I'm liking Kirk. But it's anybody's game tomorrow!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-10 00:31:31	@BobbyBigWheel in midst of planning my daughter's wedding, so can really relate to this! #tableseatingtroubles
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-10 00:55:16	@DonnaDeegan Pinking it up!!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-10 18:51:09	#ThePlayers Mother's Day at the TPC with my girls! http://t.co/jJozkTWgmr
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-12 04:39:25	@MichelleDBeadle Who the hell is this @MichelleDBeadle??!?
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-12 04:44:46	@TonyTuss @TheDamnBrad @MensPictures now THIS is funny!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:02:30	@TGMowerman @LowellPoynter @SitiRogers @Rcarpentieri1 Yes, it is Jimbo's time now, but after Jimbo, there will be another. How it all works.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:05:52	@ghostofhypotia @MinnySeminole @jmslimick @LowellPoynter @SitiRogers @TGMowerman @Rcarpentieri1 read the full transcript of interview.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:08:09	@MinnySeminole @ghostofhypotia @jmslimick @LowellPoynter @SitiRogers @TGMowerman @Rcarpentieri1 Set up. What he actually said wasn't bad
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:10:09	@MinnySeminole @ghostofhypotia @jmslimick @LowellPoynter @SitiRogers @TGMowerman @Rcarpentieri1 Disagree. Mistake was talking to Finebomb.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:13:22	@MinnySeminole @ghostofhypotia @jmslimick @LowellPoynter @SitiRogers @TGMowerman @Rcarpentieri1 whoever.that was mistake, but not disloyal
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:14:33	@TGMowerman @MinnySeminole @ghostofhypotia @jmslimick @LowellPoynter @SitiRogers @Rcarpentieri1 maybe, but not proof of disloyalty
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:20:17	@ScubaSteve864 Kinda like me jumping on Bucs bandwagon cuz Jameis???
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:28:44	@ScubaSteve864 and I'll follow Jags for Rashad; Browns for Cam and O'Leary, etc. Sunday's gonna be busy!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:30:10	@MinnySeminole not selling short at all. Agree he's sharp, but a sharp 85 could be tricked by a younger ass.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:30:43	@MinnySeminole especially a huge, obnoxious ass.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:31:53	@ScubaSteve864 Agree. Lot easier to focus! ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:35:36	@ScubaSteve864 I got tix to see JW/Bucs against Cam/Panthers in October. Ought to be fun!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:46:27	@ScubaSteve864 Def different vibe-college is better IMO, but always loved Cam, and now there's MY QB playing him. Epic.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:52:18	@themikegreen54 Sadly facing the future minus JW. Stages of grief. Finally worked thru denial, but it was hard.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:54:35	@GoCubsGoAP @themikegreen54 yeah, will probably revert back to denial stage all over again . Sigh.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 02:56:50	@GoCubsGoAP @themikegreen54 Plus the home schedule sucks. Double sigh. Sounds like a heavy drinking kinda year.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 13:30:05	@WCTV First, comment out of context is not correct. 2nd,JW, like any young person to parent,did embarrass occasionally.But still love him!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 14:40:18	@FSUNOLE21 @AMFKNole his "fault"was only in being old school. I know him. Good man, &amp; built house Jimbo is remodeling. ;)
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 01:33:03	@SitiRogers @TGMowerman @Rcarpentieri1 Read the full article - if you're gonna be pissed at someone, pick The Ass Finebaum, not Bobby!
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 01:36:01	@TGMowerman @SitiRogers @Rcarpentieri1 yes! And Finebaum's typical MO. Really, really dislike the guy. Really.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 01:38:07	@SitiRogers @TGMowerman @Rcarpentieri1 Bobby would never slam a kid as portrayed by Finebaum portrayed. He taught Jimbo about saving kids.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 01:41:48	@SitiRogers @TGMowerman @Rcarpentieri1 Sometimes with men like Finebaum, it's just feeding the beast. He'd just turn it around again.
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 01:42:51	@TGMowerman @SitiRogers @Rcarpentieri1 TN and Andy Staples already commented on it, too
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 01:45:41	@SitiRogers @TGMowerman @Rcarpentieri1 true that no one likes to be misrepresented, and that's least if what Finebaum did. Really set him up
302355508	MeehanLinda	2015-05-13 01:48:26	@SitiRogers @TGMowerman @Rcarpentieri1 Think we're all in agreement, just not sure a response will work to fix anything with Finebomb.
