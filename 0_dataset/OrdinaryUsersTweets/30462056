30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-18 03:00:42	#SongsToMakeLoveTo All Your Hate- @OfficialBVB (watch @BryanStars and you'll get it)
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-18 04:34:49	I cannot believe my ears are still ringing wtf
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-18 12:41:55	@RebelDetonator sure.. If it's the history of mcr or bvb
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-18 12:43:29	@ericaanncecilia I'm just gonna warn you now that my twitter is very band obsessive and I won't hate you if you're annoyed and unfollow me!
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-19 16:40:33	@BryanStars this 😃😊😁
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-19 18:05:23	I'm in hell again
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-18 21:22:20	48 hours ago I was watching @AndyBVB talk to me... And now I'm watching shitty Disney shows. I've sunk to a low level
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-18 21:35:28	Found batman on tv so life has improved again
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-20 12:42:14	I DONT OWE YOU ANYTHING!!!!!
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-20 20:22:38	I'm so over my job it's not even funny. Getting paid to do nothing will make you go insane. I can only stand my thoughts for so long #KillMe
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-22 20:36:23	Cause the world is ugly, but you're beautiful to me @gerardway &lt;3
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-19 01:36:59	@JinxxBVB love you &lt;3
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-19 19:19:30	Dying of boredom 😒
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-20 00:11:47	@AndyBVB @JulietSimmsALL goddamn you guys are too cute!!
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-23 00:31:57	@RebelDetonator I think @andybvb wearing the @MCRofficial top you have was better js
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-21 17:36:48	I love @AndyBVB and @JulietSimmsALL like hot damn guys http://t.co/7KCld9jhpm

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-22 01:39:06	Ann MCR/BVB playlist of every song each has ever done was a brilliant idea #Eargasm
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-22 04:10:05	SING IT FOR THE BOYS SING IT FOR THE GIRLS EVERY TIME THAT YOU'RE LOSING SING IT FOR THE WORLD!! #ImDoneNow
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-21 00:14:18	Listening to @piercetheveil is the same as doing my spanish homework right?
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-23 04:02:32	@RebelDetonator how drunk are you? this shit's from like 2010 http://t.co/UxeZsIMbq8
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-21 00:02:10	@AshleyPurdy I question what happened to make you tweet this...
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-21 15:15:54	I AM NOT AFRAID TO KEEP ON LIVING I AM NOT AFRAID TO WALK THIS WORLD ALONE!!!!
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-21 03:20:20	@RebelDetonator agreed. I almost fell in the dirt laughing
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-21 03:29:52	So apparently fear of failure doesn't make me want to study as much as it used to #IProcrastinate
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-21 16:01:26	I'm becoming addicted to @JulietSimmsALL
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-23 16:43:44	@RebelDetonator Those reminders never seem to work for me...damn band obsessions
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-23 16:44:31	@gerardway Morning Gerard! (even though it's almost 1pm here lol)
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-22 00:46:59	How come she can be a bitch 24/7 no problem but the second I call her out on it I'm the mean one #WTF #IAmSoTired #BullShit
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-22 00:48:43	@RebelDetonator that sucks!!

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-24 00:46:59	@RebelDetonator it kinda sucked anyway...but it prob would have been fun if you were there :/
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-24 20:14:53	@RebelDetonator @MCRofficial i mean it works the chances of cutting my fingers/ear to shreds are much higher tho :/
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-24 20:15:45	@BryanStars OMG Bryan hahaha. Thanks for that, I needed a laugh and idc if the whole cafe on campus thinks i'm deranged
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-25 01:35:02	There's not much about today that didn't suck...I think I'll make it an early night
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-26 00:45:12	There's 14 year olds who know what they're doing w/ their life and then there's me like...ummm yeah idk what to tell you

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-27 02:02:38	No but seriously I was invited to two parties and I'm at home half asleep (w/a headache) watching batman. #WhatIsWrongWithMe #ISuckAtCollege
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-27 03:55:39	@HarryDaHero I could write you a pretty long list of bands that actually care about their fans but I think @OfficialBVB wins this in my eyes
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-27 03:58:13	Why am I only now discovering Prince's batman?!?!?!
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-27 04:04:41	@RebelDetonator the reasons why the two of us are friends are at a max tonight #WeAreSoFuckingLame
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-26 13:56:30	Bout to be trapped in hell while feeling like I was hit by a bus #hoorayforcolds
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-22 03:43:54	@RebelDetonator KISS ME YOU ANIMAL!!!

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-27 04:16:48	@gerardway what have you been up to lately?
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-27 23:11:13	My bro is jamming to @Q102Philly right now and I'm just like ewwwww #INeedToGetThisBoyHelp #ASAP
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-28 00:26:23	So I listed what I find most attractive on a guy...the results were @gerardway and @AndyBVB
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-27 12:35:31	Holy fuck it's cold as balls wtf?!

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-27 23:18:44	@RebelDetonator yepp that's what I think when i see your tweets every day ;p #JkJK #ILY
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-27 23:27:58	My mom's not home and she randomly just text me asking if she was annoying me. #Confused
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-28 02:02:14	My twitter has 3 major phases, jonas brothers/disney stars, complaining about east and shoprite, and now( aka ALL THE BANDS)
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-24 18:11:09	I broke my phone #HeartBroken http://t.co/yR14o1ZBpE
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-26 22:32:14	@BryanStars na na na mcr always
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-26 23:05:51	I love this video of @OfficialBVB more than I should http://t.co/gVL1Dow75V
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-28 13:24:50	@ccbvb it's October so it must be a ghost! 👻
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-24 19:32:26	At least I can still listen to music #DumbPhone #OfAllTheWaysToBreakIt
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-24 19:38:56	So besides the horror of today I'm pretty sure I've developed a strong obsession for @piercetheveil
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-24 19:59:44	If I have to get a new phone I won't be able to use the case @AndyBVB loved at the meet and greet on 10/16 :(
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-28 16:54:02	You only live forever in the lights you make, when we were young we used to say that you only hear the music when your heart begins to break
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-28 01:13:18	@NSNOfficial ruined bohemian rhapsody #OMGMyEars #Crying #Why
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-28 01:19:48	@mazimazoo OH GOD I WISH I COULD
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-28 03:12:51	@gerardway am I crazy or did you edit your pro pic to a vampire Gerard?
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-25 15:04:26	Having a shattered phone screen sucks but I don't have $200 for a new one :/ #firstworldproblems
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-25 15:05:09	@RebelDetonator watch band interviews instead... It's funnier 😜
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-28 17:30:38	These next two weeks are gonna be hell school work wise
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-25 17:26:48	@BryanStars MCR &lt;3 forever in my heart
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-25 17:36:41	@ChrisABiersack maybe this will go down as one of @OfficialBVB 's worst tours, but I think the guys are handling everything really well
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-28 18:28:10	@kassidyshadow08 @ChrisABiersack @JinxxBVB @OfficialBVB your make-up is awesome tbh
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-29 13:31:29	If my car wasn't part of my problems today I'd turn around and go back to bed
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-29 20:27:57	So apparently it's #nationalbestfriendday so here's a pic of me and ma bitch of 16 yrs @RebelDetonator dressed as bvb http://t.co/6ebZKrDTRu

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-28 19:51:11	@FATSBAND you belong with me&gt; taylor swift
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-28 20:07:21	I love how @AndyBVB always tweets and then decides he's being too harsh and deletes every time he's ranting
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-29 22:35:26	@BryanStars it's keeping me sane right now
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-29 22:47:47	@BryanStars that and your funny interviews too!
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-29 02:25:49	@BryanStars I like #2's lady deer legs
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-29 03:34:31	@RebelDetonator @BryanStars @HarryDaHero @KrissTheBunny @JohnnieGuilber1 yes I second that!!!
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-29 04:26:48	Someone explain why I thought watching the conjuring was a good thing to do before bed?
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-29 12:23:21	@KrissTheBunny reasons to despise my sister's dog no. 500000000
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-31 03:14:52	The conversations that happen w/ @RebelDetonator when we are both tired and angry #WhatAreWeTalkingAbout
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-30 18:08:45	I could totally get behind a punk goes disney album.
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-30 20:07:57	Well this is awkward
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-10-31 11:44:54	HAPPY HALLOWEEN AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY @FrankIero 🎃👻🎉🎈

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-11-01 14:41:25	All right we sacrificed the Jonas Brothers can we have MCR back or do we have to get Bieber and One Direction too? #MCR #ComeBack
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-11-01 03:28:51	@AndyBVB @JulietSimmsAL Cutest. Couple. Ever.
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-11-01 15:44:03	@RebelDetonator can we dress up for Halloween and take pics at Thanksgiving/Christmas?
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-11-01 22:05:10	@RebelDetonator this confuses me
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-11-03 22:19:38	@SWStheband is in Philly tomorrow and I can't be there 💔💔💔
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-11-03 23:50:15	Loving @RedeemRevive as I do my hw!!!

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-11-04 00:10:29	@AndyBVB I think you mean forgets not remembers, but this is one of my favorite internet jokes lol
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-11-04 00:41:50	Watching my sister try to adjust to an iPhone: PRICELESS
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-11-04 01:14:36	@RebelDetonator yeah that solves absolutely nothing...in fact it makes more problems and money spending then going to the philly show
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-11-02 03:22:04	No I didn't spend 4.5 hrs on the phone with @RebelDetonator
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2013-11-02 14:20:48	That horrifying moment when you're out of eyeliner #SOS #Help

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-01-14 17:31:46	@deefizzy no point in worrying about what other ppl are saying. It won't change anything. Might as well live the way you want to!
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-01-14 18:22:12	@deefizzy I can see the entertaining part of that
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-01-13 20:16:08	@RickyPDillon @AllTimeLow all time low never gets old

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-01-22 04:05:01	Well I've successfully spent all day mindlessly browsing the internet in an attempt to entertain myself. Snow days aren't fun as an adult :(
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-01-22 02:34:10	@RebelDetonator yeah that sums up our lives perfectly
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-01-23 16:05:20	(To the tune of Antivist) Middle fingers up, if life choices suck, I'm sick to death of questioning, every single choice I make!!

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-02-03 04:12:05	@RebelDetonator I love how you aspire to buy barbies over paying for college lol
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-02-04 16:14:16	That was an unwanted adventure
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-02-04 13:43:46	@danisnotonfire worst feeling ever!!!
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-02-04 20:30:50	@deefizzyworld for a first vid just say who you are and some things you're interested in. Feel free to browse my vids for ideas!
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-02-04 20:31:41	@deefizzyworld it took me five tries before I uploaded my first video. You'll get there!!

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-02-26 04:30:18	@KnowingCrissy add @RebelDetonator to that too! They both have basically said the same thing about me stressing over things I can't control

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-14 13:25:38	@RickyPDillon OMG story of my life right there
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-14 14:55:09	It is mid-September so why am I still staring at the outdoor pool?
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-14 16:28:26	This is just the homework to-do list... No clue when I'll worry about all the club related stuff #killme #college
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-16 14:36:35	So I rush here through traffic freaking out that I'll miss your hrs to find out you put the quiz online n I could've stayed at home #pissed
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-17 11:50:07	I hate mornings
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-18 14:14:56	Fell asleep accidentally and my article I finished days ago is late cause it wasn't submitted online #FuckThisWeek
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-18 17:34:50	Rush to leave early cause there's been a ton of construction and there's absolutely none today... #IHaveShitLuck
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-18 23:45:43	@Joe_Sugg @Caspar_Lee and@troyesivan made it into my schools paper! Even little Cabrini knows you guys 😘
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-19 01:11:13	I am so fucking dumb. Am not pm. I can't schedule/read. #embarrasingstories
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-19 01:23:52	These are the moments where I need someone to listen and tell me it's ok. I don't handle this feeling well
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-20 21:16:12	Homework is done for 3.5 courses! #BreakTime #Lame
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-21 17:28:44	I've got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match. What a catch...
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-21 19:58:46	Always had a dislike for @sampepper now it's solidified forever.
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-22 16:25:54	Too much needing to be in two places at once 😳#savemd

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-26 19:33:10	@CatchThatStonem oh no did something else happen?!
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-26 22:35:50	@CatchThatStonem rly :/ it's a shame how horrible people are being on there lately.
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-29 03:14:25	It's hard to let yourself sit with your thoughts, but I think it's something I need to do more often. Shutting out technology feels good.
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-30 15:43:46	I haven't had this great of a day in forever! I don't see how it could possibly get better because everything is perfect:)
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-30 16:00:06	@AmberNSchwartz thanks love :) I haven't felt this happy in forever! How are you?
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-30 16:21:24	@AmberNSchwartz is this a happy/sad travel?
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-30 16:24:38	@AmberNSchwartz how far away will you guys be from each other?
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-30 16:28:08	@AmberNSchwartz damn that sucks. At least it's 2014 and it's very easy to talk :)
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-30 01:31:21	@shayleybourget do my real caterpillars satisfy you? http://t.co/FoKk60LETd
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-30 20:04:08	Just caught wind of the allegations about @veeoneeye and I'm devastated to say the least
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-09-29 01:01:08	That was soooo good! I cannot wait until next week! #OnceIsFrozen
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-03 19:36:00	At night in my house I'm still all alone.

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-06 19:25:31	@OMandM feels like forever because I really connect to the lyrics and love the balance between @austincarlile and @aaronpauley 's voices
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-05 11:17:26	It's literally like I'm 'sleepwalking' after #SelfHelpPhilly this morning @bmthofficial
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-05 20:49:27	@AmberNSchwartz he was a youtuber popular for his music that turned out to have been manipulative to young fans earlier this year
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-05 21:21:18	@AmberNSchwartz the sad truth :(
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-05 21:37:32	How am I staying awake after #SelfHelpPhilly yesterday to do hw? Well @bmthofficial blasting in my headphones of course
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-06 00:10:13	@OMandM feels like forever 🙏

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-11 20:41:25	Damn @olobersyko is going hard with the @DropDeadUK promo's this weekend
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-11 21:07:12	@HarryDaHero I'm the exact opposite. Sign me up for a speech but kill me for one-on-one/small group shit
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-13 11:52:30	@olobersyko @bmthofficial I'd be more excited if I could actually pre-order it but I'm part of your jealous u.s. fans rn

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-16 04:40:10	@elmakias @robertcdelaney @xcadaverx @olobersyko why'd ya tweet it if you're not gonna share? 😕
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-16 04:42:17	So I just discovered @ThisIsPVRIS and it combines so many elements of my fav music #whitenoise #newmusic
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-19 01:26:32	To spend money on some camera equipment for music videos or to make crappy ones on the iphone; that is the question #help
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-16 15:13:43	Enough of that split personality disorder stuff. I only have this one twitter for myself now!! #cabcom101

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-21 02:23:08	@JeffBelonger I think it depends on the content of the tweet
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-21 02:25:50	@AmberNSchwartz I wish I had time to get into them again! Switching majors as a junior has me doing something 24/7 :(
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-21 22:34:03	@JeffBelonger I can agree to that. I think it should only be retweeted if it enhances the content of your page
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-22 03:49:25	Sorry to hear of the passing of #BenBradlee http://t.co/8Jnl7DQcbA #cabcom101

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-23 19:33:17	@OMandM it's amazing!

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-28 16:14:50	“@HuffingtonPost: U.S. child poverty rate hit a 20-year high 4 years ago and it's not budging http://t.co/76fgcDlQeC” sad truths #cabcom101
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-28 16:42:30	@genesimmons opinions are usually ridiculous and rude, but this one doesn't have a horrible message http://t.co/mOqwjNxjvO #cabcom101

30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-30 16:48:44	@bmthofficial tweeting hate for don't look down is great. A 'meh' song for a movie suddenly means the end of the world #calmyourself
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-11-02 00:36:33	@elmakias omg! you almost look like @piercethevic
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-31 02:42:48	@CovenantHouse Does it cost the gov't more to pay welfare/send young adults to jail than it would to help them live independently?
30462056	SamJacobsPa	2014-10-31 18:21:35	I need to work on this procrastination problem :/
