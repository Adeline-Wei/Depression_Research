314131410	osullivan55	2014-05-07 02:45:11	The reason I like climbing so much is because it relieves you of all your worries &amp; stress. For a short while, it's just you &amp; the wall.
314131410	osullivan55	2014-05-07 02:45:25	seriously if you've never climbed, or are in need of a stress reliever, go climb some rocks.
