318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-01-24 21:43:05	I hate that I can't make everyone happy
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-01-23 12:38:11	Everyone needs to calm down. Complaining over twitter isn't going to make them cancel school #sorry
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-01-19 03:41:31	These drunk guys are freaking hilarious 😂

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-01-28 03:14:40	@marebearr15 that is freaking awesome! I wanna come over and meet Mr. Cat now😸
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-01-28 03:18:18	I'm not quite sure why the fact that @marebearr15 cat's name is Mr. Cat entertains me so much...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-01-30 12:30:04	I have a feeling this about to be a good day😊
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-01-30 12:36:03	It's so warm outside!

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-01-29 03:18:37	Everyone freaking out about Spanish makes me wonder if I should be freaking out about Spanish...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-02-01 03:36:38	Not the best day for Jen #needsleep
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-02-01 04:19:40	“@AnnaWojkowski: Why am I texting to my sisters boyfriend?”
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-02-01 22:06:40	I can't stand any of you.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-02-01 22:48:14	I don't know where I would be without you
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-02-01 11:50:44	I'm honestly impressed with how little time it took me to get ready

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-02-02 20:48:10	I need to get out of my house. I can't stand any of these people
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-01-31 20:42:50	I don't ever want to take these sweatpants off 😍

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-02-04 22:59:44	“@tsloc96: @Jennaa_Benna nine times outta ten you a ten”
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-02-07 20:00:26	Oh gosh, that was a disaster

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-02-22 14:38:44	Pretty sure I just demolished my algebra grade💣💥
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-02-18 16:54:44	People that try to use correct grammar, but then still manage to fail, honestly crack me up.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-02-18 17:01:08	@marissa_nelson3 No it's not! Hahaha I would've told yaa!

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-02-23 03:19:28	@brettacuss lucky you! It definitely does not work that way in my house!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-02-23 19:34:40	The fact that it's almost swimsuit season frightens me.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-02-23 19:41:30	@marissa_nelson3 I'm too much of a baby!😭😰😥

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-03 18:13:09	I can't believe how close we used to be #unreal
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-03 19:15:08	Never thought I would admit this, but I miss how close we used to be

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-02 18:58:28	@marissa_nelson3 where are you?!😱
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-03 03:03:53	@yosuke_silver Jack, it's sad that you know all of their names
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-03 03:05:27	@yosuke_silver well it's also quite sad that you felt the need to google them
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-03 03:34:07	Lol at all of you. You guys think I don't know but I do
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-03 04:17:41	I just looked back at every text @AnnaWojkowski and I sent each other today and realized how pathetic we both are
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-04 11:52:57	Why's it so light out?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-04 20:38:18	Please prove me wrong #please
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-04 23:00:15	Well on the bright side, today can't really get much worse

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-09 17:53:05	I've never felt so shitty
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-09 22:52:31	I should probably get out of bed, considering that's where I've been all day
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-10 00:05:25	@Devoncorissa I'm just making a brief appearance at my dads birthday party haha

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-10 03:15:43	Nothing I do really helps at all
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-11 15:26:51	I feel like I'm gonna throw up, I really don't want to do this
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-11 21:05:15	Stupid bus driver...don't tell me what to do

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-20 22:36:22	This chemistry test will be the death of me.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-21 10:38:28	It's too cold to look cute

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-25 01:02:51	@katelynselleny @shay_soltesz @annawojkowski AGREED
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-25 14:20:37	I wish this stupid English paper would write itself.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-26 14:24:37	Of course the WHOLE paper is due Thursday😒🔫
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-26 18:44:35	You never did give a damn thing, did you
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-26 22:04:16	Guess I gotta put my pants back on now that people are coming over..
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-26 23:59:31	These snapchats Tim is sending me are making my life😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-27 00:20:36	@timmyhamblin everyone obviously knew it was about you. Duhhhh
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-27 00:38:45	Now honestly, that pisses me off SO MUCH
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-27 01:23:47	Done with the pre-writing👍
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-30 00:58:36	Alright, Oregon is about to mess up my whole bracket.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-30 01:28:26	@brian_irish don't hate on the ducks!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-30 01:36:39	@brian_irish we can't be friends
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-30 01:49:38	@brian_irish that's a very good point!

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-28 01:58:52	@yosuke_silver what's wrong with you.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-28 02:02:54	@yosuke_silver definitely not a valid excuse!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-28 02:07:05	@yosuke_silver Of course you did. Doesn't surprise me one bit...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-28 02:35:04	@yosuke_silver DID YOU REALLY JUST GO THERE?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-31 13:39:36	It's sad how many people ignore the true meaning of Easter.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-30 02:52:28	Jack is making me mad tonight
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-31 16:46:10	Ya know, those chicken and waffles chips weren't all that bad!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-26 01:02:52	@J_Brunsteader you've always got me!😊
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-26 01:06:38	I wish I was going somewhere for spring break. Everyone else I know is gonna be gone #loner
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-26 01:13:55	I've been sitting here in a towel for a good hour. Maybe it's time to put clothes on..
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-30 03:19:08	I'm an angel😇 Jack needs to shutup
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-30 03:23:13	Jack thinks that tweeting about me is gonna make me even more mad😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-30 03:25:00	@yosuke_silver @tsloc96 I'm not getting in a pool
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-01 00:54:30	No Anna, I am not making a Harlem shake video with you. Like what's wrong with you.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-01 00:59:29	@BrittanyyToth most awkward moment of my life...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-27 11:35:01	Happy birthday @xoxoxo_Haley I'm glad we've gotten so close this year! Have a great day! LOVE YOU💜😘

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-30 19:31:36	To visit @KingKoumos at work, or to not... #decisions
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-01 13:22:37	I love waking up to my dad blasting Justin Timberlake, and no I'm not being sarcastic
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-27 20:01:39	I don't even know what to do with myself anymore.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-27 20:36:13	@tsloc96 I'm already on that!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-01 15:49:47	The bible verses Trevor sent me this morning literally made my entire day!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-01 16:32:10	Maybe we've been living with our eyes half open, maybe we're bent and broken.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-28 02:37:31	@yosuke_silver we're not friends
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-03-28 02:47:22	@yosuke_silver whatever you wanna tell yourself to boost your self esteem👌😌
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-02 03:04:03	I hate this so much, honestly I don't know what to do anymore.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-02 03:22:23	And honestly, you're tearing everything apart and it's hard to watch
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-02 04:10:35	I've never seen it this bad, and it's really quite sad
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-02 15:55:17	Of course I have no signal in the salon
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-02 15:55:22	I JUST WANT INTERNET
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-02 21:20:14	Filling out all these job applications is not my idea of fun.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-04 01:00:54	LOL at my dad teaching Jack to bowl😂 @yosuke_silver

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-04 01:06:54	@schwendenator I know I'm dying😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-04 01:08:44	@yosuke_silver that's because I don't need help!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-02 22:57:09	Of course my mom makes a really good dinner when I'm not hungry.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-02 23:46:51	“@ashplass: So excited for the color run” I wanna do that soooo bad!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-02 23:58:35	@Frankie_TheTank @ashplass we should run as a team!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-03 00:04:39	@Frankie_TheTank @ashplass sounds good to me.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-03 01:39:30	What kind of job application is this?!😳
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-04 10:52:03	Why am I wide awake right now?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-03 03:57:38	A foot cramp, headache, and three hours later and I'm still not done with these applications.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-03 04:05:10	Great. I lost my earring too.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-03 04:18:12	I wonder how long I walked around without my one earring. Probs all day...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-04 13:59:52	We were supposed to leave at nine, but of course we are waiting on my mother.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-04 14:54:57	@xoxoxo_Haley where did you apply at?!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-04 14:59:43	@xoxoxo_Haley I turned in a ton of applications yesterday! I'm pretty sure I have an interview for east coast custard but that's it so far!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-04 15:01:14	@xoxoxo_Haley I hope so! Let me know how the interviews go for you:)
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-04 15:16:34	@xoxoxo_Haley @kyle_andree all Kyle has to do is yell at little kids all day! That doesn't even take any skills😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-04 15:18:05	@xoxoxo_Haley @kyle_andree yeah! I'm with Haley! Lazy sounds pretty accurate!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-04 15:20:00	@Kyle_Andree @xoxoxo_haley Haley, I think Kyle's just really jealous.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-03 15:45:04	I've slept in later and later each day this week.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-03 19:18:41	This test better be easy, I'm not in the mood to think right now.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-07 16:37:54	Why is it that I lay out for not even five minutes and I get stung by a wasp?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-07 17:28:00	My finger still stings so bad😭
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-07 18:22:24	@brettacuss and this would be the reason I rarely go outside! Haha
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-07 23:50:41	That was definitely the funniest thing I've seen all day😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-08 01:29:10	I really just need to focus on being happy #newgoal
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-08 01:43:47	@Shay_Soltesz right?! I'm just full of great ideas! Haha
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-08 01:48:10	@Shay_Soltesz surprisingly, I'm actually pretty good right now:)
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-08 01:49:00	@brettacuss oh thanks Brett! That, you definitely can!😊
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-08 01:58:50	@Shay_Soltesz yeah I know it's terrible! And I miss you&lt;/3 I'll see you at practice though!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-07 01:27:51	So excited to be hangin with ma girl rizpah😄😍😘
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-07 02:37:20	@brettacuss BRETT GET ON!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-09 01:42:05	@tsloc96 @yosuke_silver is that what it said I tweeted?!😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-09 01:45:03	@tsloc96 @yosuke_silver oh gotcha!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-07 03:21:48	@yosuke_silver cause that's not weird at all...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-07 03:24:47	@yosuke_silver soo pathetic...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-09 02:32:00	Whoever invented parabolas can go die.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-09 02:45:37	@nchristie725 I can't even begin to describe my current state of frustration...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-09 03:14:00	@LightningBOLTZ4 oh great! Just what I wanted to hear😔
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-09 03:15:54	@LightningBOLTZ4 love you too😘 And I may have to take you up on that offer!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-09 03:19:02	@LightningBOLTZ4 alrighty! sounds good!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-08 11:16:44	I feel as if I forgot something really important..
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-09 10:43:36	@brettacuss haha trust me, I NEVER know what is goin on!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-08 22:52:35	This algebra homework makes zero sense.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-08 23:03:02	I love that I can wear shorts to volleyball😊
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-09 11:15:35	@brettacuss you and me both!!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-09 18:59:30	ONLY THREE AND A HALF MORE HOURS
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 01:51:38	@yosuke_silver alrighty then, you do that
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 01:55:09	@yosuke_silver I will, I'll complain ALL I WANT
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 01:55:22	My twitter hates me
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 01:58:50	@yosuke_silver good one.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 01:59:09	@yosuke_silver good one x2
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-09 22:35:39	Is it really 81 degrees out?!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-09 22:46:47	@EmilyBucholtz nooooo! I was so excited!😔
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-10 01:18:40	Why do I do this to myself?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-14 01:28:18	Anyone who's not doing anything tomorrow should definitely come to spire and watch me play some volleyball☺👍
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-14 01:47:21	Now that I am thoroughly annoyed...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-14 01:54:27	@Gab_Ransom @shay_soltesz oh geez thanks guys!😊😊😊

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-11 02:32:33	@brettacuss you'll have to share some of it with me soon😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-11 02:36:24	@Frankie_TheTank says what I'm thinking before I say what I'm thinking #mindreader
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-11 02:53:28	@brettacuss alight! I'll talk to you soon cause I wanna hear it! Haha
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 19:48:28	I feel like I'm the only one who cried during that movie
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 20:41:19	@brian_irish you cried?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 20:41:37	@Bay_Baker it was just so moving! I can't get over it! Haha
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 20:42:01	@brettacuss it was a documentary we watched for school called Honor Flight!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 20:48:47	@brettacuss oh I bawled for this one. It's waaaaay worse
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 20:52:41	@brettacuss it's okay! Sometimes you just gotta let it go hahaha
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 22:38:34	@Devoncorissa @minnick_ian HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T!😂 #lies
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 22:51:08	@Devoncorissa @minnick_ian I knew it! Haha I bawled my eyes out, I don't think it was possible to NOT cry!

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-14 22:23:34	@Kyle_Andree are we exempt from anything?!

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-14 22:39:30	@Kyle_Andree @yosuke_silver whatever those are, they sound good! And yeah! Especially since Kyle will be taking exams, we'll send pictures
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-14 22:46:24	@Kyle_Andree @yosuke_silver sorry Kyle😉
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-14 23:33:27	Why do I have the hiccups?😳
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-14 23:36:01	@Kyle_Andree it says it's cause I ate too much😔
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-15 00:15:25	I wish I was as cool as @xoxoxo_Haley and had big packet done.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-15 00:21:36	@xoxoxo_Haley I'm not even close to being done! For some reason I'm having the most trouble finishing it😞
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 00:27:32	“@raspberrycreep: its nine in the afternoon and your eyes are the size of the mOon”
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 00:45:08	“@AnnaWojkowski: @Jennaa_Benna should really stop singing” I have a beautiful voice☺
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 00:58:28	@brettacuss @annawojkowski THE FACT THAT YOU KNEW THAT IS AWESOME
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 01:07:12	@brettacuss @annawojkowski that song is freaking sweet. And yes, he is my favorite☺
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-12 01:43:22	@yosuke_silver none of those have anything in common
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-16 22:40:38	The amount of time I waste thinking about this is pathetic
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-18 02:22:08	I smell brownies, so I go downstairs and am told I'm not allowed to eat them #cool
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-17 21:35:56	I hate this so much
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-17 23:16:57	I just wanna thank @yosuke_silver for being awesome and stuff.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-17 23:21:08	@yosuke_silver Naaahh, I'm good. Just don't make me mad and we won't have to worry about that
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-18 02:32:32	My family is judging me for drinking orange juice with my brownie...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-18 18:40:48	Last day of this torture!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-22 01:20:27	“@HeyItsCarissaaa: When all you wanted was to be wanted”
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-22 01:25:50	Just because you're pissed off doesn't mean you have to ruin everyone else's evening.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-22 02:32:07	Yes, I just fell up my stairs, but only skilled people do that.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-22 02:40:00	@KingKoumos no need to be mean about it😔
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-19 22:44:49	I honestly hate Ohio. How do we go from 85 to 45 in less than 24 hours? #freezing #how
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-19 23:00:47	You are the most hypocritical person I have ever met.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-20 03:38:56	@Frankie_TheTank I wanna see that so bad!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-20 23:18:52	At Menchie's with my lovelies @KirstenSalminen and @yosuke_silver 😍🍦
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-21 01:31:17	Making @yosuke_silver watch duck dynasty👍
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-21 05:24:52	Why the hell am I shaking right now?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-21 05:27:32	@EmilyBucholtz @Kyle_Andree yeah guys I'm fine☺ thanks though!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-21 13:18:47	Someone take me to get Starbucks
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-23 02:05:43	Yessss I'm probably getting my camera☺👍
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-21 03:26:20	Damn, this brownie's kinda good
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-21 03:33:22	@yosuke_silver I gotta say, I doubted you at first.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-21 04:08:07	@Kyle_Andree Keep your head up! Getting down on yourself only makes things harder!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-21 05:01:52	That was so unlike me to do, holy crap.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-21 13:55:01	This kiwi better be ripe by now...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-21 14:01:25	Thank you Jack, for making my phone freeze up for no good reason #appreciated
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-21 14:03:42	Should've waited another day to eat that kiwi...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-21 22:59:08	Wow, I really kinda wasted this whole day
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-23 19:09:27	@Kyle_Andree Kyle I'm enjoying your picture😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-23 19:11:45	@Kyle_Andree what do you mean what? Haha YOUR PICTURE
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-23 19:17:15	@Kyle_Andree nothing, it's pretty😊
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-23 19:19:30	@Kyle_Andree you have no proof of that!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-23 19:23:27	@Kyle_Andree can't argue with the truth!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-23 22:16:32	“@jess_noll: nothing is ever easy”
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-23 22:34:01	Lol my dad just said they should get rid of the Internet. Like what?😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-24 01:47:37	I really need this school year to end already #stressed
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-24 02:12:52	@yosuke_silver cry about it! Volleyball never ends until 9:30!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-24 02:14:03	I'm really hoping this is worth it! #SoExcited
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-24 02:22:37	@yosuke_silver alright. I'll give you that one. I can't really argue there
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-24 02:24:30	@yosuke_silver yeah...don't start jumping to conclusions.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-24 02:27:15	“@marissa_nelson3: Ryan Lochte is definitely beyond perfect 😍😍”
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-24 10:56:51	I really needed late start this morning😔
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-25 02:58:55	This conversation right now is killing me😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-25 03:34:50	Now that I am thoroughly disgusted, I am going to bed.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-25 02:09:30	Glad I got all my anger out👍
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-25 02:45:25	Yup, that just kinda ruined my whole mood.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-26 17:42:37	Mr. Ozinga and his kid look exactly alike☺
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-28 14:41:04	“@xoxoxo_Haley: So Taylor Swift is coming to Columbus and I wanna go!” I'll go with ya!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-27 00:11:51	@jess_noll east coast custard!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-27 02:57:28	Jacks soo awesome, I freaking love him
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-27 03:03:14	Okay Jack thinks he's cool for stealing my phone
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-29 00:59:52	I'd rather forget and not slow down🎶
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-29 01:34:34	I hate when my foot falls asleep!😒
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-29 02:26:21	I'm gonna be a train-wreck these next two weeks #stressed
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-30 01:31:54	Great way to end my night! #sarcasm
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-29 10:41:43	@Shay_Soltesz I'm listening to what your mom said yesterday #lazyday
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-29 18:22:50	I feel like the weeks have started to take longer and longer to end.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-29 19:38:06	My camera came!☺👍😎📷
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-26 20:48:49	First day at work😳
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-04-30 19:34:35	Cool don't answer my call.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-01 03:20:53	I understand ZERO of this algebra and now I'm probably screwed. #someonehelpme

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-03 00:48:12	Venting to @jessiemmorgan makes me realize how much I miss her💔
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-03 01:07:12	I have too much on my mind, and I just need a break from everything.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-04 14:49:48	There are some things I will never understand...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-04 14:54:13	“@xoxoxo_Haley: @Kyle_Andree how's Claud? 😂😂” I'm seriously dying right now!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-04 14:54:37	@xoxoxo_Haley yeah 7 to close!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-04 14:55:54	@xoxoxo_Haley I guess I'll never get to visit you! This is quite sad.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-04 14:57:42	@xoxoxo_Haley ohhh that's a really long time! Haha I'm not good enough to work that long yet.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-04 15:00:43	@Kyle_Andree @xoxoxo_haley nah that takes too much effort.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-04 15:01:03	@xoxoxo_Haley you think they'll let you go early?!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-04 15:02:48	@xoxoxo_Haley I wish I got let off early! Haha so not fair.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-04 15:03:30	@xoxoxo_Haley I think Kyle's mad.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-04 16:03:28	A part of me wants to wash my car right now.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-04 16:08:22	@Kyle_Andree wait what? I don't get this one😳

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-04 20:01:44	Kyle is mad because he doesn't own his own chair.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-04 20:21:25	Literally everyone in my house but me is asleep right now.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-04 22:08:14	It's kind of a perfect day for napping.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-06 21:26:13	You are the last person I want to discuss this with
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-07 01:49:14	Too much volleyball for one day. I repeat, TOO MUCH.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-07 02:47:54	I just need a nice foot rub.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-08 15:09:34	We'll hold you in our hearts forever and a day, and we'll never be the same. So the last toast that we raise goes to you💙

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-08 16:29:04	You are one of the meanest people I've ever met. And you expect people to like you?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-08 16:41:33	@Kyle_Andree I'm perfectly healthy??...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-08 17:34:32	You are an asshole.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-07 10:50:27	I can feel this isn't going to be a good day...

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-10 21:05:34	@Kyle_Andree you can't get driven until you do??
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-10 21:06:56	@Kyle_Andree that's why riverside drivers Ed sucks so much. The same happened to me😠
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-10 21:12:37	@Kyle_Andree let's hope the crappy driving school with give you your money back then!

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-15 19:49:35	Is there a reason my dad finds it enjoyable to make sure none of the TVs work before he leaves the house?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-13 19:17:28	Why am I so slow when it comes to doing homework?

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-27 20:59:35	Why does Pennsylvania have such nicer roads than Ohio?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-27 00:59:28	Winky faces are just really creepy. Sorry, but it's true.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-27 01:01:59	I feel like that was on purpose?😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-27 01:43:05	Just to clear things up, the emoji winky face is okay. The other one is what creeps me out

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-29 01:26:57	How do I even begin to study for this? I'm so screwed...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-31 02:41:50	I've never crammed so much in my life.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-30 19:19:43	My little brother just texted me "Do you want anything from taco hell" 😂😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-05-29 02:56:39	@tsloc96 and @yosuke_silver are weirdos. And my response to all of those statements is NO.

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-02 03:30:59	I suck at being mad at people.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-02 17:13:42	Why are people so heartless? I don't think I'll ever understand
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-02 17:24:53	I was gonna lay out but there's a ton of guys in my yard landscaping. So never mind.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-02 17:36:38	I guess the world is just telling me to be forever pale.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-03 22:53:45	@xoxoxo_Haley @brian_irish @adamcimperman @emilybucholtz it's okay! I'll sit with you even though Haley won't!

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-04 17:50:41	I seriously got soooo lucky😳
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-05 21:52:16	Lost your mind trying to get it back.

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-10 02:46:20	Slightly disappointed but whatevs
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-07 17:15:48	@Kyle_Andree maybe I don't like running when it's cold out
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-07 17:19:23	It's national donut day and I have yet to eat a donut.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-07 17:21:41	That was by far one of the best books I have ever read.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-07 19:23:13	That workout killed me
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-07 20:59:13	And we know its never simple, never easy.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-10 03:50:56	Word of the day: fantastic
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-10 04:23:07	I have FANTASTIC friends
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-10 04:36:30	Now that I've used the word "fantastic" five too many times, I think it's time to call it a night
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-08 17:43:25	Started a tab in my dads name at the country club😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-11 17:37:19	Why did it take me so long to load that film? #dumb
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-12 03:36:58	@tsloc96 it's a secret and staying a secret! #sorrynotsorry #loveyou
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-12 04:29:45	Alright, I give up
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-12 04:38:43	Well I'm pretty sure I made zero progress and only feel worse now.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-10 18:18:49	I feel like haven't talked to you in weeks😔
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-10 20:24:55	As much as everyone hates rain, I actually think it's pretty.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-12 20:37:48	The only thing I've eaten all day is a can of pears.

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-20 03:03:33	Jack never says anything nice to me #sadtweet
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-18 03:49:15	If I could just travel back in time that would be great.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-21 00:45:35	Awh I miss you guys!

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-21 02:58:15	I'll tweet about Jack if I want. It's not like I was lying.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-21 03:03:04	You're such a dream-killer.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-21 03:10:53	Keep those insults rolling! #lovethem
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-21 03:28:05	Jack's "awesomeness" overwhelms me
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-21 03:35:49	@yosuke_silver I was being serious
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-22 20:47:37	Seriously, just blame me for everything.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-23 22:30:16	I have sand in places that sand shouldn't be.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-23 22:42:35	And off to more volleyball.

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-27 15:50:51	The struggle to find skim milk around here is real.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-26 04:34:05	The thank you card I got from @KillTheFridge today was seriously the best.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-26 17:15:44	Literally all I've done todayy is sleep and lay around.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-06-26 19:26:32	@Frankie_TheTank of course as soon as I leave for the pool, you leave😔

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-07-07 01:30:04	So I just raced Katelyn down the pool. And it was the easiest thing I've ever won.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-07-07 01:32:36	I'd say I'm a pretty good swimmer, wouldn't you?😂 @katelynselleny

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-08-13 20:39:02	Why did I just do that to myself?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-08-16 04:23:31	I don't know why you thought telling me that would make me happy. It actually kinda pissed me off

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-08-17 14:41:02	@ebalante they don't let me do anything fun like that! Remember?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-08-17 14:53:12	@erkthejerk22 @ebalante I'd want the tips!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-08-17 14:54:14	Awkward moment when you can't even get in to work...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-08-20 15:28:49	Legitimately dying over the fact that @yosuke_silver and I have parking spots directly next to each other 😂😂

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-08-26 10:55:16	I always forget the traffic is this bad on the first day..
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-08-26 11:02:48	Moving at a steady 5 mph
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-08-26 11:02:55	Jk guys we stopped again

318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-09-08 22:50:36	It is a PERFECT night to drive around!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-09-10 00:26:06	This is the dumbest English paper I've ever had to write.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-09-10 01:32:48	Everyone in my household is having mental breakdowns from stress at the moment.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2013-09-07 16:41:21	They play the weirdest music at the hospital..

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-01-13 11:15:55	so of course only one of my alarms goes off and of course it's the latest one

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-02 21:09:02	Why do I struggle to write every single English paper I'm assigned?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-03 02:12:25	Who needs to watch the game when you can just go on twitter?

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-05 23:02:34	Guys! I think there's a squatch in these woods @katt_evanss @EmilyBucholtz
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-06 22:05:26	Old man cuts off Katie for gas pump. Old man gets out of car and apologizes for being grumpy old fart
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-06 02:38:55	Katie named her pillow pet "Horny"😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-07 03:10:31	My family is so rude and I can't stand any of them
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-07 03:12:33	@ashplass is it weird that I was seriously considering?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-09 02:41:03	@DarlingBrianna devil spawn

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-09 18:20:06	Who wants to help with this lab? because I really have no motivation to do it
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-08 21:56:01	might've been a little too tired to fight, might've been I got a little drunk last night
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-10 21:52:04	That just turned my day right side up😊
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-11 02:27:05	Just remember one thing: karma
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-11 21:35:17	@tsloc96 Tim I only ever went once!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-11 22:37:43	Just remembered that time nancy told me "if you keep dishes in the sanitizer too long, they won't be sanitized any more"
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-12 02:05:59	When was enough, enough?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-12 03:10:17	You can't expect the best of people because, in reality, you only get it about 10% of the time
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-12 03:16:27	@AnnaWojkowski and losing feels so bad
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-09 00:53:59	These last few weeks have been terrible😞

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-18 23:03:35	I don't think anyone understands how badly I want this
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-19 03:38:17	Pretty sure @katt_evanss and I have reached a new level of sad and pathetic
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-19 03:40:24	@katt_evanss BOTH

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-20 00:11:48	Michael: "the girls are dehydrated for me"

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-14 21:52:21	Almost got hit by some old guy. I hate driving
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-22 03:26:10	Somehow just managed to shift my car into neutral while going 65 on the highway oops
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-23 21:39:44	Why is it I still cannot get myself out of bed
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-15 03:33:02	Valentines day lived up to my expectations
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-15 04:33:55	@katt_evanss from my momma😉
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-15 04:54:12	What goes around comes all the way back around
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-24 00:26:30	This 60 minutes is really hard to watch
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-15 15:12:35	Okay, this is actually terrible
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-24 02:02:04	Being in high school sucks
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-24 02:04:11	@DarlingBrianna SHE DID THAT TO ME THE OTHER DAY I WAS TRYING LUCID DREAMING AND SHE WOKE ME UP

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-24 02:29:33	@erkthejerk22 @DarlingBrianna as of this past weekend!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-22 21:44:13	I was completely wrong in ever trusting you with anything
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-22 21:53:08	And I didn't do anything to deserve any of this bullshit
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-16 04:25:11	Now in feeling so fly like a cheese stick
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-16 04:26:05	The taco just took Katie's chair
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-23 03:22:42	Barely any oxygen making it to my lungs
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-23 04:08:50	I feel like I'm slowly dying
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-23 04:25:30	Feel like crying but that'll make me feel worse
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-23 04:47:01	I like watching bull riding because all the commercials have attractive cowboys in them
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-25 11:57:06	Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-27 12:03:42	I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-01 22:02:43	@DarlingBrianna what did nancy say?😱
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-02 01:35:27	I never realized how good Oreos are
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-01 02:57:55	@katt_evanss the similarity is almost scary
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-28 01:51:15	It's like I'm standing at the station and I'm waiting on a runaway train🏃🚂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-02 15:36:48	I wish dreams were real cause I didn't want to wake up from that one😔
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-02-28 11:34:43	My bed was feeling especially comfy this morning
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-01 19:10:12	Okay, 80's movies are definitely the best!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-01 19:22:29	She's gonna bring the sunshine, and she's gonna bring the rain
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-02 03:29:45	Tired of being tired
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-02 05:47:56	Driving home during a power outage is so much scarier than you would think
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-02 05:48:34	There's no lights or signs of civilization
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-02 23:37:48	Saddest moment ever when the water just stopped working while I was in the shower😭
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-02 23:53:28	@kylemandree I had conditioner in my hair, if that counts
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-03 00:13:12	The closest thing to perfect is Carrie Underwood, no doubt
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-03 13:41:05	Happy birthday to my girl @marissa_nelson3 😊🎈🎁
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-05 00:42:16	I'm so tired of feeling upset

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-11 00:21:51	Bout to cry cuz I hate chem so much
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-13 11:43:46	My prayers go out to all the victims of the crashes on the turnpike. Driving past all of it this morning and it's just crazy!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-13 11:55:28	I've never seen so many semi trucks in my life

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-15 02:10:36	Thinking of you makes me sick to my stomach
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-14 00:42:16	I've got my heart set on this country town❤️
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-15 22:31:53	Speechless and yet I have so much I want to say at the same time
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-15 23:57:16	The wiggles is actually a quite scary television show
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-17 12:54:50	Who. Even. Cares.
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-16 22:51:58	Why did I just let Katie do my hair?😁
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-18 01:45:15	So bout this math homework..
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-18 02:09:14	Things always get worse before they get better
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-15 23:52:10	Boy I'm babysitting: "I don't like sharks, but princesses are nice. They don't have sharp teeth"
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-17 23:39:09	Gonna ride that donkey donkey, down to the honkey tonkey🐴
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-19 01:54:53	Listening to Of Mice and Men at work made my night a little better
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-19 21:42:17	I can't wait to start my own family when I'm older that'll be nothing like my family now
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-19 21:57:24	Seriously, everyone in this house is so damn self-centered
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-20 00:19:40	I'm wearing my contacts and glasses at the same time like the rebel I am
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-20 00:37:22	And I've accomplished nothing in the two hours I've been "doing homework"
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-20 00:48:20	This road's been putting miles on my heart, sweet heart
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-21 01:19:41	I don't think I can hold myself together much longer
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-21 13:00:20	I need to get out of this place
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-21 15:47:40	The only thing that sounds good right now is a back rub and a nice long nap
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-22 03:15:08	I'm trying to convince Ember to go to prom with me and get a fake ID so she can get in
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-23 02:31:14	I wanna thank everyone for the birthday wishes! Really made my day great😊
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-24 15:45:37	I struggle when getting pedicures because I squirm around like a little girl every time the lady touches my foot
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-24 01:57:29	“@AnnaWojkowski: The girls are all over Michael's Instagram http://t.co/4BVVM9Fnuz” 😂😂😂

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-24 17:50:14	I need spring break so I can get out of this country
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-25 01:11:21	That was by far the worst paper I've ever written, and yet I feel no shame
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-25 13:01:38	Yeah, you're an asshole
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-25 19:32:07	@katt_evanss those look SO good😱
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-25 19:35:45	@JonesMarcus14 Happy Birthday!🎈🎁

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-25 21:21:56	Did it really just snow in the one hour I was asleep?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-25 22:55:09	Like is it necessary for me to come in just to close?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-27 12:45:06	Happy birthday @xoxoxo_Haley 🎈🎁🎂 I miss you bunches!!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-28 00:14:14	I might just puke😷
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-28 00:38:07	Soft serve🍦
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-26 11:03:34	I don't think I have it in me to make it through the rest of this week
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-29 18:52:13	Lunch was good, except that I forgot my box of leftovers on the table
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-29 19:27:19	My house is an ice box right now
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-29 19:31:00	I asked Michael to describe his personality in a color and he said "HOT pink"
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-27 10:19:55	My whole mood is ruined because I thought it was Friday
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-29 22:01:12	Only Katie and I would decide ice cream is a good idea on a snowy day
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-29 22:33:41	We've gone everywhere fun in painesville including fro-yo, pat catans, and gander mountain and now there's nothing left to do
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-29 23:19:22	“@Nashgrier: Hey http://t.co/j6SIsb8Vpt” for you @katt_evanss

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-03-28 19:55:24	Happy birthday girl! I hope you had a great day😊 We gotta hang soon! @caseydickinson2
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-04 16:28:00	I'm kinda happy to finally be getting home
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-04 22:36:44	If I hear Treasure one more time today, I will punch someone
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-04 23:31:10	None of my messages will send and the wifi here is sooo slow😭

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-06 01:05:03	My grandma could be a comedian
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-06 01:38:59	Boy, did I miss my best friends💕
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-06 01:53:59	Michael has some weird techno mix of Radioactive playing on repeat in the other room
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-06 02:08:54	"He's such a pretty girl"😂 @katt_evanss http://t.co/srctSieah9

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-08 01:56:32	My life is complete now that I have finally been given my official subway visor😎
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-08 02:10:29	Glad this day is finally over😊
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-07 01:18:57	My room looks like a tornado hit it...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-08 20:43:00	@AnnaWojkowski that caption is lame js
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-07 02:15:55	What the actual hell?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-07 02:23:12	Confuseddddd
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-06 03:01:23	I love when you turn off all the wifi it's so COOL
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-06 03:05:44	I just want to continue on with my Jenna Marbles marathon😭
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-06 03:15:59	“@katt_evanss: @Jennaa_Benna yams? Wat are yams” gravy is just Native American tears
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-06 03:19:33	Talladega Nights with the sibs
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-06 04:07:47	This song on snl just ruined my evening

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-08 12:57:08	To get an early dismissal or no?...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-07 10:56:26	Worst night of sleep I've had in a long time
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-09 13:23:05	@katt_evanss did you just use the word "bezerk"?😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-10 01:04:03	What even was tonight?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-10 02:20:13	Reached a new level of lazy considering I'm just gonna sleep in my clothes for tomorrow
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-07 18:54:22	My life tho
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-10 02:36:52	@kylemandree would I make that up?

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-07 20:53:58	My little just told me I'm never going to get married and that my hair smells like wet dog. I love Mondays
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-07 23:07:48	@DomenicCici10 HOW WERE YOUR FLATZILLAS?!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-10 09:50:04	I've decide I'll just sleep the whole bus ride
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-13 01:48:55	PAINESVILLE IM BACK
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-13 02:37:04	Using my ice cream cone as a microphone right now. No shame
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-10 13:04:07	You're only making yourself look bad
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-10 13:49:00	Why do bad pictures of me look worse than bad pictures of other people?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-12 21:17:08	How am I even sick right now?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-12 23:35:03	@Dat_Matt24 ehh, I still don't know if I see it!!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-13 00:39:37	Now that I learned what "rn" means I can't stop using it rn
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-13 00:49:18	Now that I chugged my vanilla macchiato I'm ready to go
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-13 00:49:28	LETS PARTY RN
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-13 01:23:24	I've sneezed at least 200 times today
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-11 15:16:56	Ok so I suck at bowling
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-11 15:28:07	“@katt_evanss: Why do I keep having this reoccurring dream that takes place at the bp on vrooman hahaha” again?😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-14 01:35:46	“@katt_evanss: “@Boys_South: Southern baby Sunday 😍💗 http://t.co/yfTUQwjkTR” @Jennaa_Benna” you don't understand how perfect I find this
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-10 19:35:12	If Adam sings afternoon delight one more time..
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-14 23:39:49	Okay, Anna sucks at cooking
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-15 00:34:19	I wanted to get to bed early tonight, but it doesn't look like that's happening
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-15 00:43:33	These last few months have obviously been rough for me considering my room is still a huge mess
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-15 00:45:34	My room is NEVER a mess..
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-15 01:10:13	Calm can go screw itself
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-15 01:20:16	Ok I give up, I've wasted the last hour of my night and got no where at all
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-15 10:12:16	I've never felt so drained of energy in my life
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-15 11:16:10	That walk into school was brutal
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-11 04:31:38	Anyone know this wifi password?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-11 04:35:43	I didn't know you could see other peoples favorites on twitter😁
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-12 05:00:50	Okay, now Jilliann won't stop singing afternoon delight..
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-12 05:11:18	“@DomenicCici10: I miss trev, Jill, and Jenna come home already” Jill's sitting right next to me, she said "no"
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-12 05:20:22	Everyone in our room has taken a turn wall twerking
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-12 05:35:45	Slaphappy is an understatement right now
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-12 06:04:19	@jordanhosta what room are you in?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-12 06:08:47	@jordanhosta knock 17 times if it's you
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-12 06:09:39	Why does Jilliann insist that all 4 of us fit in one bed?
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-12 12:41:20	I feel like I got hit by a truck
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-16 21:54:22	The best part of today so far was finding queso in my fridge
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-16 23:10:51	And here I find myself in the same place I was in last year😞
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-17 01:06:15	About to have a breakdown because there's no dessert in this house
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-17 01:45:47	“@AnnaWojkowski: Geez Jenna what did you get me into...” @Dat_Matt24 mwwaahahaha
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-17 01:56:13	Katie told me I'm the only person she double texts so y'all can suck it
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-17 02:21:16	I love my @tsirosfrankie ❤️
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-17 10:59:52	Okay I've overslept every single day this week oops
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-15 22:43:01	Woke up from my nap to find out I work free cone day tonight! What a great surprise! Yay!
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-15 22:48:03	@katt_evanss they were perfect I'm still laughing to myself
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-15 23:21:01	Don't know why I'm here at work so early...I must be super excited for free cone day
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-17 23:38:39	Only tip I've made tonight was from my dad
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-18 00:22:49	I swear this song haunts me
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-18 02:08:42	Tired of never getting any support from my family
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-19 04:55:41	Currently in the process of planning out my whole life and writing it on a piece of paper
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-20 17:06:21	I didn't know that our hike today was actually going to be a HIKE
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-20 20:30:24	It's so nice out and I have nothing to do
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-19 04:33:48	Well that movie was way more depressing than expected
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-19 16:21:46	Why do I get the feeling that everyone in my house is pissed off at me?..
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-19 20:02:14	“@katt_evanss: My heart is set on you, I don't want no one else &amp; if you don't want me I guess I'll be all by myself”
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-19 22:11:40	Bout to flip out because Anna ate all my red jellybeans
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-20 01:19:24	The kids are so wound up over the Easter bunny coming tonight😩
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-20 02:13:37	@EmilyBucholtz YOUR MOM IS SO CUTE
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-20 02:17:09	I seriously hate this😞
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-20 03:11:09	Can't help but wonder how you're doing
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-20 21:38:28	Someone should hangout with me so I stop eating
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-20 21:47:30	@katt_evanss HURRY I'm getting fatter by the hour
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-22 21:41:16	Did not mean to sleep for two hours oops
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-21 01:17:56	Ok Michael is sitting here mimicking every sound the baby is making back to her😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-21 02:49:24	So I've determined that I'll probably fall asleep before Katie even gets here
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-21 03:50:54	“@katt_evanss: Anna Swetel... Nice ring to it”
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-21 04:02:45	Ahh I love messing with Anna
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-21 04:21:36	Come on, come on, give into me

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-23 02:32:00	Why do all the towels smell like cigs?😷
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-21 05:01:34	I strongly suggest y'all watch Katie's snapchat story
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-21 17:06:01	He's like a curse, he's like a drug

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-24 00:10:08	Anna, you ain't fooling anyone by hiding the ice cream behind the gluten free waffles. Good try

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-25 14:29:15	This is the second time this month that I've been told I look like Emma Watson😳
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-27 02:01:56	My mom thinks she's cool because she's texted more people than me today
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-25 21:24:09	My Friday night consists of the food network
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-25 22:48:44	Katie: "Why am I wearing black and blue? I look like a bruise"
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-29 10:37:20	Just now getting all my homework that was due Monday done
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-28 19:38:46	I just spent hours making dinner and I don't even get to eat any of it😞
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-28 10:15:16	I can deal with no school
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-29 02:12:49	I'm in the most pissed off mood right now and I don't even know why
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-30 20:36:52	But I know, at seventeen, it's hard to see past Friday night🎶
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-02 01:29:39	I just love love love farms
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-02 01:55:10	Okay I'm already in love with Miami, and I've been here for five minutes😍
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-30 22:54:40	If Nancy makes me move my car across the street I will not be a happy camper...
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-30 22:58:45	Annnnnd she's making me move😄
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-04-30 22:59:47	I would love to point out that there is no one even attending this spirit night and the parking lot has plenty of room
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-04 20:14:12	Finally met my manager after 4 months of working here😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-04 21:03:48	@DarlingBrianna did you quit?!

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-05 01:24:49	All these prom pics are bringin me down
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-05 01:45:50	@DarlingBrianna @HottaMolly33 I only get like four hours a week in the store! 20-25 there seems so far fetched😳
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-03 17:09:44	I do not feel good at all😞
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-05 03:43:48	Tired of this keepin me up each night
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-05 03:50:21	The light at the end of the tunnel is neon
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-05 04:11:47	My mind might be the last thing you make me lose
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-05 10:54:09	Already been cut off by two buses today😄
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-05 10:59:23	Whoever's directing traffic today really sucks at it
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-02 21:32:59	Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-03 23:25:53	I like Emily because she always has donuts
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-05 19:46:36	I smell like subway😷
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-03 23:42:56	So Emily's little brother knows more about my car than I do
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-06 01:21:34	Doesn't look like I'm getting out of here till ten
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-05 00:24:41	@DarlingBrianna @HottaMolly33 there's going to be no one left but trainees

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-12 01:14:16	It's been a rough day😕
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-12 02:17:15	The real question is how many times will I shower using my brothers axe before I suck it up and go buy more shower gel

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-13 20:40:34	All I do at Katie's house is watch her make me food😂

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-18 02:16:47	Best part of babysitting may just be watching SNL

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-20 02:26:31	In the mood to just cry and go to bed
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-20 22:30:25	Today is the last day I want to be at work😞
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-21 14:35:36	I'm already starting to feel stressed out for this test
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-22 02:34:11	Not sure how much more school I can take till I have a mental breakdown
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-23 02:45:15	I really need to do my laundry but the washer is all the way downstairs

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-25 02:47:33	The rodeo is on television right now, and I'm a happy camper😜
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-25 03:26:38	Don't know how these guys do what they do! It's amazing
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-25 22:18:28	The question of the day is how did Katie's picture of juice get 71 likes?😳
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-26 16:32:32	A big thank you and a lot of respect go out to our troops. Thank you for all that you do.

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-31 19:25:49	I always look at my time hop and try to decode who my subtweets were about😂
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-05-30 17:53:40	It's definitely been one of those days

318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-06-02 20:54:48	The people I work with creep me out too much
318616812	jennawojkowski	2014-06-02 21:08:28	The guy I'm working with is already rapping to me, and I've been here for five minutes. This is great😑
