321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-04 20:39:35	Good news, I didn't fail my Spanish test. I swear working at Alfredos has been helpful.

321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-10 13:03:27	@sicahmtover I agree, its almost obvious when you're in high school by what the school focuses on more, which isn't education
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-10 13:09:49	@sicahmtover lol not exactly, but good point. Just that schools focus on athleticism just as athleticism gets a higher paying job if pro
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-10 13:10:11	@sicahmtover if that makes sense at all for what I'm talking about. Like it being a cycle basically.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-10 13:22:45	@sicahmtover I think I saw something about the pro football players on tv a few nights ago! But yea its ridiculous.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-10 14:07:33	@Moody_D I guess it does make sense when put that way, but it also doesn't help with the pay cut teachers received this year

321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-14 16:56:46	highschool was too much work.. just too much.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-14 17:15:22	"the top is the best part of the muffin" haha
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-14 17:58:51	"@StephyyMarieeee: HAPPY BIRTHDAY @Shelby_Chav hope you have a good day! love you!" Thanks steph!! Love you too :)

321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-13 23:30:01	Seeing the little boys I babysat for 3 years at the movies with girls is the cutest thing ever
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-15 06:06:09	@KatieKanaly thank you Katie! I did :)
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-17 03:45:50	Tate has the same sweet tooth as me. I think that's why we've been together for so long. Because nothing else would make sense.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-17 04:07:57	I don't think I've done that much homework this whole semester so far
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-17 06:09:41	@Cheese_661 lol trade classes?
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-17 07:13:41	@Cheese_661 that stinks, maybe it's just you're taking crappy courses.. haha
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-17 07:16:50	I came home early in order to get to bed at a decent time, but I've been here talking to my mom since I walked in..
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-17 07:20:39	My mom remembers the stories I tell her better than I remember them myself.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-17 07:23:14	I absolutely hate that miss America, in some peoples eyes, requires hunting, tattoos and a military background.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-17 07:23:37	no offense to anybody, but since when did that become what America stood for??
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-17 07:25:07	I can see the military part as being American, but the other two things? .. not everyone does/has those.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-16 04:24:59	I just now realized how old I am.. I was looking back at selfies on Jr high and tates 10 yr old cousin goes, wait why do you have a camera?
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-17 14:21:56	This older lady in my class always wears a hot pink jumpsuit and pig tails.. I'm so confused.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-17 14:24:08	Humidity and my hair aren't friends today
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-14 08:38:26	Terrific way to begin my birthday #sick #owy #ick #why #bleh
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-16 06:02:06	The amount of love I have for the people in my life is unexplainable
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-17 16:21:18	Geese crossing http://t.co/z8C1yIv5mV
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-17 16:59:10	My grandpa just said a lady at church has "kitty cat hair"
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-17 17:09:24	@allysawhitebird  I noticed that today too! It made me happy.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-17 18:04:28	Humidity, long hair and backpacks don't mesh well together
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-19 16:45:01	@sicahmtover I made one of those in early high school and it was awful, people love to be mean when no one knows who it is
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-19 16:46:09	@sicahmtover I guess people just got bored with themselves. Blehhh. It happens
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-19 19:51:49	@sicahmtover why tank you!
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-19 20:01:59	If you drive carelessly in the rain I don't like you
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-19 21:06:38	Can I just call in tonight and cuddle and nap?
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-18 18:26:35	almost impressing myself with my Spanish class. maybe being able to understand Spanish is my Hispanic blood.. #ornot #spanishclass #college
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-18 18:29:38	This lady in class said that Spanish isn't an easy A for her like me.. bishhh what do you mean? I've only spoken English my whole life..
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-20 07:00:49	Don't spend time beating on a wall, hoping to transform it into a door.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-20 07:10:26	Being a girl is so hard. One week out of the month you become 10x more emotional than usual
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-20 18:43:08	Is fall just teasing us .. or is it here to stay?
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-20 18:52:03	@Cheese_661 I would prefer it not to be.. I just want to know. Lol
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-20 20:08:02	@Cheese_661 you're in the wrong state for that haha
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-18 04:38:07	@rachaeldeanne aw poor Jade! that's so sad, in the cutest way possible.. if that makes sense.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-18 19:46:15	Girl you just stuttered all over ONE sentence you had to read in Spanish, get off your phone and pay attention! You need it
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-18 20:36:41	@LindseyyKayyyy someone has too much time on their hands... Hahah
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-18 20:38:02	@LindseyyKayyyy hahah no way, not according to your vine. Lol
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-18 20:40:10	Tate just smiled for no reason in the middle of his class when he saw me
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-18 21:52:09	The look I'm giving this girl right now. http://t.co/jYzKCXuvFb
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-18 21:52:38	The bishhh won't quit laughing. Like HEY, I'm studying bio over here

321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-21 17:45:05	Some days I'm like how in the heck do these skinny jeans fit me üê≥
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-21 17:52:19	I feel like me and @sicahmtover could have been good friends if we would have known each other when I was in high school. #isthatweird
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-24 07:11:45	MOVING BACK IN THIS WEEKüôå‚ò∫
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-24 14:21:22	Nature valley oat and honey bars are so good, yet so messy and obnoxious.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-24 15:33:10	I thought we were friends.. until you laughed at all the professors dumb jokes and answered ALL of her questions.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-24 15:48:18	This man cut me off on the ramp to get onto the highway.. like dang chill. 
Then I returned the favor and got ahead of him. #success
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-22 08:55:26	I really dislike when people think they know how Tate is.. No you see the front, I see him. üò¨
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-22 08:55:37	But HEY, don't careeee
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-22 08:56:09	I was in the hallway and I thought someone walked behind me.. Then my dad does and I said I thought someone did and he goes yea I just did
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-22 08:56:30	No kidding dad, sheesh. I meant before you.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-22 08:57:39	I went to my actual house today and went through my dresser and it was like a totally new wardrobe
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-22 08:59:02	It's just been over 4 months since I've worn over half of the clothes at my house.. I'm too excited to move back in
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-24 19:08:18	@_MariahColvin once this week is over we will have to do something
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-25 06:07:04	I know I'm going to be extremely happy to be back home, but when next may rolls around idk what I'll do with myself. üò£üò≥
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-25 03:39:19	Exhaustion is real
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-25 19:22:27	made an A on my first and second Spanish test. really do enjoy learning how to speak this language
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-25 20:22:21	The excitement I have right now is overwhelming
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-26 18:11:36	Coming to class is so inconvenient when you're in the process of moving and fixing your car at the same time
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-26 01:25:15	I'm in love with it. http://t.co/H7rWUhfzgj
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-23 06:10:49	It just feels like sometimes our lives work well together and other times it just doesn't.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-26 04:03:33	@AcaciaRogers its so pretty! I looked at a couple of places then settled on Walmart. Lol go figure.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-26 06:27:34	leaving me speechless in the worst way possible
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-26 06:30:53	we just made a tv show of cops.. white trash version and everything
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-26 06:32:42	sugar bear over there in his nightgown.. make-up streaming down your face, covered in paint. white trash.

321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-26 06:50:15	good thing I had my yogo pants.. had to crawl through my trunk to get into my car. my butt literally almost got stuck
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-26 06:55:30	"Be the boy you want your daughter to date. Be the man you want your son to be. Be the guy your partner wished for; a Gentleman." listen up
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-27 06:52:02	So much to be happy/thankful for.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-27 06:52:42	Can't believe that I'm actually back in my house.. It doesn't even feel like home anymore. Idk what does now
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-27 06:54:07	@StephyyMarieeee did you guys move back in too??
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-27 06:58:35	@StephyyMarieeee oh my that sucks. It honestly feels SO weird being back here..
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-27 07:02:50	@StephyyMarieeee yea we've replaced a lot.. Just there's so much that we have to do before it'll feel right
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-26 17:04:36	Stress level is out of this world
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-28 04:56:40	I just kinda want to go to the casino..
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-28 05:00:30	messaging my brother on fb.. because that's how my nights going
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-01 04:04:25	all of my things change the time by themselves..
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-01 04:50:09	Finally got to see my long lost bestfriend @rachaeldeanne tonight #love #12years http://t.co/nRF9HVndsW

321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-01 14:13:50	I'm extremely close to cutting my hair off #annoyance
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-01 14:16:42	@brittney_12 HAHA its in my way constantly though.. especially with wind
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-27 22:33:52	I tried on about 10-15 Mac lipsticks today.. guess how many I left with. 0. 
Some of us look better without lipstick unfortunately.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-27 22:37:27	@sicahmtover you're too kind. Thank you! I felt so bad for the sales lady, everytime I'd put one on I'd be like no.. it looks weird.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-27 22:46:42	It's almost 6 on a Friday and I need a nap..
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-01 17:38:07	Mixed emotions that's all I'm feelin
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-01 17:39:22	Mom just told me that the guy over there on a date is eye balling me.. I look up.. straight eye contact #awk
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-28 16:35:04	I hate when people can't take responsibility for their own actions.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-28 16:50:37	how much trouble do you think I'd be in if I didn't go to work tonight...
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-28 17:07:24	you would think that if you did something wrong you'd be able to realize it, yet I'm still being blamed for your actions. #blowsmymind
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-28 17:08:04	on another note, it's cold outside and I get to wear my new VS jacket.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-01 21:20:05	"Hi how're you doing? good, my name is Shelby and I'll be taking care of you" 
literally what I say to every table. #work #wah #serverlife
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-28 18:22:48	Run run run away, as fast as you can
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-28 18:30:04	I am so angry that next week it's going to be hot again. I want to wear jackets, sweaters and boots. PRONTO
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-28 18:32:41	it makes me sad that there is no hope.. the way you were raised and the things that you've seen make you into the person you are
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-28 19:12:26	I miss @rachaeldeanne
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-28 19:37:37	@rachaeldeanne let's be friends again soon!
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-30 17:15:28	It never fails that I get my hair caught in the blow dryer
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-30 18:24:08	I think one of my biggest pet peeves is when someone who is fully capable of taking the stairs up two flights takes the elevator instead
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-30 18:25:43	finally going to get to see @rachaeldeanne at her game tonight!
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-30 19:49:17	this little Filipino lady in my Spanish class answers every question out loud even when she's wrong.. no shhh.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-30 19:57:46	I feel really bad for this girl, she said she didn't really have a family .. and she's a loner.. feeling very lucky.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-02 03:39:00	Met a girl at my table tonight that graduated the same year as me from southmoore and sat down with her and her dad for about 30 minutes.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-02 04:03:18	@_MariahColvin love you too!
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-02 05:20:00	Don't get me wrong, I love this state.. But some of the people here.. Dang. You give Oklahoma a bad name.. üòÅüò≥
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-30 20:41:20	Your rolly backpack is unnecessary
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-30 20:51:22	Baby. Last time calling me baby, last time calling me crazy crazy crazy
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-29 05:00:52	getting everything unpacked and organized in my room feels nice
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-29 05:03:23	my nails have been looking rough this week.. painting and moving stuff does not help them
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-29 05:04:57	I prefer my weeks more than my weekends.. at least when it's week time I get a night off.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-29 05:05:54	why can't every restaurant be closed on sundays? or at least keep mcdonalds open for those who don't/can't cook.. is that fair?
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-29 05:06:45	I really can't complain though, I've been making regulars left and right lately. my cutest couple that comes in comes on Sunday mornings.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-29 05:07:41	I like that you can't really tell anything about someone until they start telling you stories.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-29 15:02:07	I just want to stay in my comzy bed all morning.. Is that too much to ask for
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-29 15:42:35	Love coming to work and my opening duty is already done. #woo
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-29 15:48:54	When people at work try and chit-chat .. just no. It's too early for that
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-09-29 16:01:10	You really want Mexican food at 11 in the morning? #no #goaway

321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-03 00:48:53	even when people constantly warn you, it still doesn't always change what your heart wants.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-03 00:49:22	but in order to have a brighter future, listening to the advice is the only thing left to do.

321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-08 18:20:43	@Caiitllyynn lol that makes sense. I unfortunately came.. but I found a different parking lot that's closer to my class so that's a plus

321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-11 04:41:19	@toriiiibrook Oh! lol I thought you meant it was muffin mix. I added jello mix tonight, is muffin mix better tasting? is it always thick?
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-11 04:44:35	@toriiiibrook that's probably a good idea, I bet that would taste decent. Lindsey told me to add fruit, I need to go get some tomorrow.
321459760	Shelby_Chav	2013-10-11 04:49:57	@toriiiibrook what kind of fruit would be good you think?
