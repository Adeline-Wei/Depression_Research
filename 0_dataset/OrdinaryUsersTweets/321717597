321717597	DanielGibbs3	2011-12-12 22:51:29	Fact: the federal govt spends more on the California prison system than on nation school lunch per year. #smh
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2011-12-02 00:03:25	I dream of a world where swoll people can successfully open a straw without breaking it. @gangsta_Drew
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2011-12-19 02:35:16	Horribly small amount of motivation for school work at this point. #it'sashame
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2011-12-20 03:50:34	If you think FFDP and Bring Me The Horizon are in the same genre, you should probably stop talking about music. Forever.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2011-12-20 13:33:30	@gangsta_Drew . Maxing out today. #stoked.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2011-12-21 12:11:36	Up early to take my mom to ihop before she has to go to work. #thoughtful . #happybirthday

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-01-03 14:37:26	Today might be interesting.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-01-03 15:52:55	That moment when you realize you are losing a best friend. #whatashame.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-01-10 21:24:57	If you asked me how I am doing, I'd say i'm doing just fine. I would lie and say that you're not on my mind.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-01-11 00:25:51	Advance towards me brethren. #comeatmebro
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-01-11 13:37:13	@vessemily protein shakes don't taste the best that early in the morning. Ha :) but keep the determination!

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-01-30 18:34:11	Wish my stomach could hurt more..
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-01-30 21:02:54	@EmilyVess I could go for being vegan right now. Haha. It'd probably make me feel a ton better!
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-01-23 04:51:38	Wish Appalachian would let me know something. #anxious.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-01-30 23:48:24	Better days are coming, I swear there's truth in that. #chiddybang

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-02-02 16:42:36	Love getting dominated by a test.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-02-02 21:51:32	@EllisMarkC Ole Guacamole's is probably the best. Ever.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-02-03 00:14:04	I said that I was sorry. #noneedforthat
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-01-26 22:55:37	You choose the wrong person to be with and regret it every day when things change. #happensalltoooften

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-02-05 21:04:48	Often out of sight, seldom out of mind.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-02-11 17:58:31	What am I fighting for? There must be something more than all these words I sing. Do you feel anything?

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-04-30 11:16:19	@its_trickkky_ that could be correct. :P
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-04-26 01:09:41	Breaking Bad is one of the best shows I have ever seen.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-04-30 23:34:11	Spitting game. #forrealthough
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-04-26 10:52:49	Kind of wish I was heading back to New York today.. @JacquelineWyatt @SavannahLace93
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-01 10:49:11	My tendinitis pain would come back on my workout day. #ofcourse
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-04-27 00:19:54	@its_trickkky_ Breakfast of champions. Eat it almost every morning :P
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-04-27 00:23:02	I refuse to let this crap happen again. Please let college be different.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-04 18:38:52	Just waxed the car for tonight. Shiniest car in America. #butreallythough
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-01 22:50:42	@Katie_Orndoff love. :)
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-02 10:26:52	Let me make your day.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-07 10:46:29	Getting up early to workout. Getting #motivated
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-04-27 11:10:51	How long until the tables turn? Will we ever get what we deserve? #ADTR
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-03 02:41:14	@Katie_Orndoff So you practically stole it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-05 17:18:40	I wish @katiekelley__ made my night at prom the best.. #ohwait
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-04-27 23:36:24	@katiekelley__ I mean you're the one that is supposed to formulate the answer. :)
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-09 10:23:45	Putting in all kinds of work. #motivation
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-09 22:14:23	That moment when you feel appreciated and important. #thebest
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-19 16:28:54	Back to the gym.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-19 20:05:26	@smoketheitalian Curls for the girls. Haha
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-21 10:26:49	Morning workout. Making all kinds of gains.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-21 12:12:09	When you have the whole weekend to due homework that was due Thursday, and you still don't do it. #hurrygraduation
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-21 15:40:07	I'm so glad that @katiekelley__ hates on me. #onthedaily
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-23 10:49:15	Finally got 8 hours of sleep last night, as opposed to 6. Too bad I require 11 to not feel tired anymore. #lazy
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-24 00:03:46	I really hate that I worry so much.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-24 22:59:25	About to eat at My Father's Pizza. #supergood
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-25 21:14:23	I wish @katiekelley__ could tell time.. #maybeoneday
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-26 01:49:26	Facebook, Twitter, Youtube. #Repeat #bored
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-16 22:43:55	I hate when you take a nap and wake up more tired than when you went to sleep. #defeatingthepurpose
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-24 04:20:41	How long until the tables turn? #adtr
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-27 03:51:09	Red Dead Redemption. #stillthebest
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-27 15:11:23	I really don't understand how hard it could be for the IRS to send my tax records to App.. this is ridiculous.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-29 01:35:07	Alright, so now that I have wasted time all weekend, it's time to start my homework.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-29 21:09:31	Man vs. Food on the tvs at the Y. #ironic
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-30 01:06:38	@YoungValentine1 Better have gotten some sweet kills to make up for it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-30 03:03:52	When I actually do my work and have something to print, my printer decides to stop working. #myluck
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-30 10:56:49	I have time in the morning where I just sit. Not thinking, not contemplating, just sitting. #overtired
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-30 21:44:58	@Katie_Orndoff is always introducing me to good music. She knows what's up, sometimes.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-31 00:27:53	Metallica comes on the radio, we jam. #mydadandi
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-31 02:40:19	In bed before 12? #illtakeit
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-01 10:47:56	Going to be a very bittersweet day.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-29 01:39:31	@HaleyBroadwell I'm still mad at you, so I am glad you are offended.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-29 03:03:48	So maybe I'm not doing that homework tonight.. or tomorrow.. or worrying about it. #donewithschool
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-30 01:36:09	Worst cramp in my entire life.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-30 16:42:09	Every time. #neveragain

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-01 13:20:23	I love all the porn, spam, and offers that get put on my twitter page every single day.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-02 18:18:43	Eating clean to get lean. #seniorweek
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-02 21:58:00	IRS finally sent what I needed. Time to see how much money I get. Things are starting to look up.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-03 19:40:14	"Hold your breath my dear, we're going under."
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-04 11:53:22	100 questions, 4 hours. I'll be done in 20 minutes.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-08 16:20:13	Breaking straws at every restaurant you go to. #swollproblems
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-29 12:58:43	@KaylaAllison3 at least you are doing your work. :P you need to finish signing my yearbook.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-30 01:43:58	In my calf, progressed to hamstring once I stood up. It's what I get from squatting 6,000 lbs. today. #andquitdestractingme
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-30 12:38:46	@tlunsy Pray for Plagues will always be the best.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-09 20:42:59	@katiekelley__ i'll be there first :)
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-30 20:50:56	Just got a fresh cut.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-05 01:15:34	From debated on to waited on. #khalifa
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-10 03:55:17	@katiekelley__ what a boss
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-10 11:01:07	Might be a day after everyone else, but I am now leaving for the beach.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-13 03:29:40	"Do whatever sinks your sub"
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-10 19:23:34	@billyhendley1 @The_OHanlon Both!
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-10 23:06:19	@billyhendley1 @The_OHanlon Beast Nutrition Creature.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-05-31 19:50:48	Better days are coming, I swear there's truth in that.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-05 15:57:12	@_anjalipatel I hope that your day brightens up. :)

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-12 01:16:25	In the last 48 hours I have had a solid 8 hours of sleep. #gottakeepgoing
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-14 21:58:12	@virginiaflex ready to get back in the gym and eat better man. That's a #swollproblem
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-15 16:00:35	Man time for man dimes.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-16 13:26:11	@virginiaflex That's my plan for the week man. Getting back on it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-14 04:48:06	The elements: Earth, Wind, Fire, Swag.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-16 21:09:24	@Kaybeff You need to come back soon so we can do our Masquerade dance. :)
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-17 00:33:06	That's a good time. @katiekelley__
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-19 03:12:49	I wish my Macbook charger didn't work. Cause that'd be a good time.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-17 02:57:51	Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-18 16:11:05	Of course the entire county population would be at the Y when I want to lift.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-19 04:26:17	@_anjalipatel only kinda? What a let down. :P I wish you could have hung out on senior week!
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-21 01:39:07	Finally found a car! "Don't get excited though." #stillgettingexcited
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-27 00:42:04	@Kaybeff Swoll.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-27 17:16:58	Mom just said, "Your life is becoming very exciting!" #iwouldhavetoagree
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-30 16:36:57	I can break my arm 15 degrees out of place and have it broken back and be fine. Can't get my finger pricked. #makesnosense
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-21 04:15:04	Feels good to be appreciated.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-21 18:07:28	I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, so smile.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-21 20:34:46	I've seen 3 2006 Legacy Limiteds today. Maybe it's a sign. #hopeful
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-23 14:31:17	About to put in some work. Then off to see about my Subaru.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-22 00:48:05	Can't believe @katiekelley__ has me watching BMS.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-22 00:49:56	@katiekelley__ Absolutely not.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-22 02:04:22	@katiekelley__ A Fever You Can't Sweat Out was quite a good cd back in the day. Their new stuff is trash.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-22 05:23:07	Really tired of thinking. Messes me up.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-24 18:50:40	House music and dubstep make my workout awesome. #youshouldtryit #butreallythough
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-28 15:37:03	Nothing is free. Someone always has to pay for it. It's going to be great having to wait 7 hours in line at the doctor. Thanks Obamacare.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-03 21:03:08	Making gains.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-25 21:04:16	What up college.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-26 14:10:12	Hope the Subaru got fixed. Ready to see it today.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-29 02:50:01	___, ___, ___, all up in my face. #K2SWAG Fill in the blank with your insult of choice. @katiekelley__
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-04 16:53:12	Today really really sucks so far. Really don't need this.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-04 17:38:29	@_anjalipatel Already starting to look up. Thank you :)
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-04 18:45:39	@_anjalipatel That's really nice to hear. Now if it would just stop raining. :P

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-06-30 01:56:29	Never meant things to happen this way.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-05 21:49:56	@katiekelley__ That is funny. I should have taken a creepy picture of her while she wasn't looking. #thatswhatyoudo

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-10 15:26:53	I just want to see you.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-11 16:35:44	Really don't know what I'd do without @Katie_Orndoff
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-11 17:55:59	One of those days when you can't think and don't want to do anything.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-12 15:20:17	Not going to let my day suck like it did yesterday. Heading to the gym.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-13 18:28:37	Elbow tendinitis? My luck.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-13 21:41:05	Pretty sure I have the worst luck ever.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-14 04:18:37	I'm a perfectionist. I either do something 100% or I don't do it at all. Not sure if that is bad or good.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-13 03:25:56	I wish I could do something right for once.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-15 18:46:06	Mo' gains.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-27 03:20:56	Staying up late tonight so I can sleep all day in the car tomorrow.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-30 00:10:29	Overthinking things.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-08 19:37:51	I want a job that I can wear a suit to everyday.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-30 03:48:40	@KaylaAllison3 @Katie_Orndoff Me and Katie watched the extended cut musical episode. She always said it was her favorite. :P
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-07-30 23:02:03	The iCloud Purchased downloads is probably the 2nd greatest thing that happened today.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-03 04:49:14	@10katek Hope everything goes well KSwag.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-02 03:13:44	Feels good that things are going just right for once.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-02 03:26:07	@10katek My thoughts exactly.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-12 03:21:56	@billyhendley1 What kind of hp does that thing put out?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-12 03:24:13	@billyhendley1 Dang i thought you were about 275. 300 at most. that's awesome.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-12 03:27:22	@billyhendley1 Ha, I'll know not to race you. I wanted a Legacy GT, 280hp. Insurance for it is crazy though.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-12 03:31:01	@billyhendley1 Ah man the WRX is my favorite.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-07 00:05:07	Can't even comprehend that crap.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-07 02:25:45	Change of direction, abandon all ships. #np
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-07 17:58:22	Going to the point where you are either going to throw up or pass out. #pushittothelimit

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-17 21:40:42	@Kaybeff you better come see me when you come up here :)
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-17 16:03:21	I'm just waiting on my moment.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-15 03:47:15	@MackinzieP You better tell me what you told me you were going to tell me.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-15 04:40:06	@MackinzieP You're terrible.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-18 04:06:35	Great first day of college. Our RA is that man.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-23 15:21:27	Seeing people with the 17 inch Macbook Pro. &lt;&lt;&lt;
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-15 20:05:33	I hate getting shots.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-16 13:11:52	Last day here. #bittersweet
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-20 13:59:49	@adriannafaithw I sold our vacuum for drugs. :)
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-20 14:03:55	@adriannafaithw everyone sold their vacuum for drugs. It was a crazy night
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-20 20:54:23	When your Raybans break... it's a tragic day
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-17 02:50:02	College is what I worked all those hard hours for. Ready for tomorrow. Trying to get on that Dean's List. #goals
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-21 17:03:35	Waiting in line for books is my favorite. &lt;3
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-21 18:29:23	About to walk to Business Calculus...
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-21 23:20:03	Off, off with your head. Dance, dance till you're dead. #ProjectX
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-18 15:00:58	F the Appalcart.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-24 16:33:58	Ready for 2 o'clock to roll around.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-27 12:44:01	I love when my contacts mess up right before class.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-19 17:31:40	Gym time at the SRC.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-27 18:32:46	@YoungValentine1 Ha I hear you man. It's even hot up here in Boone.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-27 19:02:17	@adriannafaithw I hear there is a super hot guy in Lovill 508.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-24 23:40:17	T.I. might be coming back with some good music. Go Get It is that jam.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-28 01:34:57	Can't win.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-28 03:43:23	Talking to @10katek improves the night.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-20 19:36:25	My first class is 50 feet from my dorm. #sleepingin

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-22 12:49:59	Girl looking for class: "I'm just going to look for someone that looks stupid." #winner
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-22 18:16:20	Lovely girls in all of my classes? No homework? Living the good life, hoping it continues. #hopeful
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-26 18:02:39	@10katek Any win over Duke is a good win.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-26 18:26:21	@10katek and what was the revelation?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-26 18:30:27	@10katek ha that's awesome! He was in an episode or two of How I Met Your Mother. Made me think of you :P
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-23 03:50:21	Tweet number 400 goes out to those special Katies in my life. Miss you guys. @10katek @Katie_Orndoff
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-23 04:28:22	Taking a preworkout 3 hours before you go to bed probably isn't the best idea. #toolatenow
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-28 12:10:59	@HaleyBroadwell what's wrong? :(
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-28 14:54:57	About to destroy my legs. Kind of excited about it though.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-28 19:01:45	Calculating business and stuff.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-29 00:59:59	Ate an hour and a half ago... ready for another meal. #collegelife
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-29 21:42:46	Can't let this math poop on me. First test tomorrow. #nervous
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-30 01:38:36	College kicked into high gear today. Couldn't be super easy forever I suppose.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-30 12:37:24	About to be a high stress day.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-30 20:06:07	Terrible day.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-30 23:32:12	@10katek is a hateful person.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-31 02:23:47	Come on weekend!
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-31 02:25:30	I wish @10katek would call me like she said she would...
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-29 16:41:48	I wish oomf knew how to discern what is a suggestion.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-08-29 18:00:13	@jordan_inman2 You and @adriannafaithw need to get better. :( I feel like I am getting sick too.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-04 20:11:52	Randomly sending @10katek seductive/offensive rap lyrics on the daily.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-12 14:09:45	Could really use some prayer for my Calc test today.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-05 16:14:16	Waiting for the rain to stop so I can walk back to the room. #dailyevent
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-10 20:14:03	Can't catch a break with school today.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-06 18:06:17	@jordan_inman2 Hey I know you aren't complaining about our gym time Jordan!
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-04 14:56:59	Could kill someone right now.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-11 04:11:37	@adriannafaithw Don't subtweet about me.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-04 18:32:13	What's ironic is that on rainy days I am super motivated to go to the gym, work on homework, study, etc. Kind of the opposite for most.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-11 13:12:47	Stressing hard about tomorrow.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-13 20:23:29	@10katek This girl in my calc class is going tonight.. I told her I had a friend named Katie that was crazy about them.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-13 23:34:35	About to go to Muay Thai with sore legs. We will see how things go.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-04 21:07:07	@10katek -_- means please send me more.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-07 04:15:06	When the girl you miss the most is all the way back home..
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-07 12:22:46	It is unreal how excited I am that I don't have business calculus today.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-15 00:10:07	@10katek What? You don't know what it looks like? You gon' learn today!
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-15 00:12:16	@HaleyBroadwell People that like Alabama. #obvious
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-15 00:15:34	Get control of your Twitter account and quit sending me spam messages. It gets old.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-15 00:44:05	@10katek Old garbage, poop.. the list goes on and on Katie.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-07 15:49:53	Sleeping till 8, going to class, sleeping another hour, eating, and debating on another nap. #college
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-08 06:26:13	When I hear "You're big, we could use you in a fight." #gettingthere
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-15 18:44:54	Probably about to spend way too much money.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-17 14:19:37	@Un_Juh_Lee Have a better day :)
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-17 17:58:16	2 classes today, then studying like crazy for my Biology Test tomorrow. Overall a pretty good day.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-17 18:53:16	My calc teacher just changed my test grade from a 75 to a 93. #thebestfeeling
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-17 18:57:07	@YoungValentine1 Dat's dat ish I don't like. (Bird sound)
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-18 02:25:31	Already meeting to set up my spring schedule? Oh well. Classes I hope to get don't look too bad.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-18 18:58:39	All kinds of tests this week. All kinds.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-18 20:25:08	@adriannafaithw You know you secretly loved that class.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-20 03:08:29	@Katie_Orndoff @Nick_3320 You know if you use an apostrophe, it cuts off your hashtag link. #valuableinformationkatie
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-20 03:12:11	@Katie_Orndoff @nick_3320 I mean.. it can be information for whoever wants to use it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-24 13:54:25	Choosing to go study in the library instead of going back to sleep. #readytosucceed
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-27 13:31:59	@alexanderbarham That good blue.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-01 04:08:32	@10katek are you doing Arts &amp; Crafts at Saint Mary's?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-01 04:15:38	@Ahntony09 All kinds of rain...... all kinds.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-28 01:48:12	Don't know why anyone would ever use the PCs in the library when there are 27in iMacs in the lab as well.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-25 03:35:53	Trying to make her day.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-28 16:14:31	When all your pants are getting super tight because your legs are getting huge. Too many gains? No such thing.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-25 12:45:54	@lilstephy04 Just skip it like you do every week. #gother
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-22 02:52:02	"Now pick that up and make me something delicious out of it." #familyguy
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-02 18:19:30	@agedwards93 I just ran out of my preworkout.. trying to take a month off. Really going to suck.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-02 18:23:11	@agedwards93 Beast Mode on leg days, and Assault every other day.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-03 01:47:59	All kinds of snap action in my back.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-26 01:27:32	Wish Season 6 of Breaking Bad would hurry up and come on TV.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-26 17:56:17	Expository Writing teacher playing Bon Iver during class. #greatmusic @Katie_Orndoff

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-09-28 23:27:26	You need to make up your mind, really quick.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-04 01:04:28	When you know you are screwed for a test and there is nothing you can do about it.. &lt;&lt;&lt;
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-04 21:43:00	@YoungValentine1 Wake up later so we can play Zombies. I'll put it all kinds of work.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-04 21:44:33	@PolosandSperrys I'm going to frame that picture.. or piss on it. Haven't decided yet.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-11 00:20:54	@agedwards93 Hey man can I bring chalk to the Y? The gyms at App make a huge deal about it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-11 00:39:59	@agedwards93 4604220. I just wanted to use some for shrugs. My grip gives out a lot on those.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-07 15:36:30	About to destroy my back. #cobralats
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-11 22:18:09	I don't always get excited about things in life, but when I do, I get screwed over. #neverfails
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-12 02:46:50	Free college tuition? Free health care? Are you that ignorant that you think nobody is paying for it? #letsbelogical
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-05 18:00:39	@adriannafaithw Let's go see Ted tonight. :P
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-05 18:17:01	@adriannafaithw I think it plays at 7 and 9. Either is fine. I'll just need to eat sometime. :P
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-05 21:44:23	@adriannafaithw meet outside your dorm in 20?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-08 03:20:08	Had the best day talking to that girl. #thinkthingsaregoingtobealright
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-14 19:11:17	@adriannafaithw New Season starts tonight at 9! :)
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-15 02:41:54	@10katek it's more of an "ope" as in "dope". Not "op" as in "hop". :)
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-15 15:15:31	Having a dream that nothing bad happened this weekend, and then everything was normal still, but then waking up. #theworstfeeling
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-15 19:56:16	About to get some work done so I can get my mind off of things.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-15 23:46:56	Guess we aren't going to talk today...
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-13 22:04:15	@James_keeper94 ha i've been watching it since I got home.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-09 14:19:40	@YoungValentine1 You gon learn today.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-09 14:28:52	@10katek Word on the street is that you are coming home soon. You better be sure to stop by and say hello.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-18 00:36:27	I wish you would realize what you just did. #donewiththis

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-20 17:36:51	@lilstephy04 You should watch Sinister. One of the demon girls' names is Stephanie. :P
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-20 18:04:02	Mom talking to my sister: "Were you drinking beer when you made your bed? Looks terrible." haha.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-21 03:06:16	Turn on the lights. I'm looking for her.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-10-30 23:18:33	@agedwards93 well when no other squat racks were open it's kind of irritating. Haha
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2012-11-06 13:56:55	I'm sorry that I want my tax money going to military defense instead of to someone that doesn't even want a job. #Romney2012

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-01 17:00:48	If you don't convert your music to Apple Lossless, you're missing out.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-02 04:02:04	This is not to be confused, this one's for you.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-05 20:18:02	Might have to take a chance.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-06 00:40:37	Or do you not think so far ahead?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-06 02:44:33	I'd make a great Valentine. Maybe next year.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-06 04:33:41	In Flames was at the Orange Peel in Asheville? Are you freaking kidding me?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-02 01:35:57	I thought that I was going to be done with math forever after Business Calculus.. but now I am taking Personal Finance. #samething
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-06 16:29:57	Got some new Emmure. About to destroy this gym.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-03 01:56:23	Welcome to the new age, to the new age.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-03 17:23:56	6 or so inches of snow. Suck it Western. http://t.co/ZqgdElxe
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-06 19:09:09	My wrist can't handle the amount of greatness I have. Gotta love some tendinitis.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-03 20:38:26	Before I die I am buying a WRX and taking it to a rally track.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-07 03:03:00	You have to work hard for anything worth having.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-07 03:09:11	It go Halle Berry, or hallelujah. Pick your poison tell me what you're doing.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-07 03:11:18	I always do that @10katek .
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-07 14:26:47	As I recall I know you love to show off.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-04 16:37:19	I am excited to see what the rest of the year has in store for me. All the gains in the gym, maybe meeting a woman, my grades. #tweet1000
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-04 16:39:01	This is it, the apocalypse.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-04 18:59:51	@Katie_Orndoff *place order here* ❤
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-04 17:22:14	@stephaniebush66 maybe if you'd answer your phone sometime you'd know.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-04 17:35:20	@stephaniebush66 hmm I remember someone saying that droids were the best.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-04 18:58:56	Show me a good, show me a good time.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-07 18:53:58	Give me a sign.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-04 23:40:06	@YoungValentine1 it's already in the 30s I'm sure.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-04 23:44:02	I jumped higher than the lanky black dude in my class. Same hight and his arms were twice as long. #endingstereotypes
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-04 23:57:47	Alright what do I have due tomorrow. Biology test, read 150 pages, finance quiz. Ah crap.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-07 20:15:50	I think this girl had some good drugs before she came to class.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-05 12:34:27	Dress for success.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-08 00:20:56	@YoungValentine1 bout dat life.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-08 00:35:04	@hunterlynbiddix I don't have time to talk like a degenerate because I am in college.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-08 00:37:25	@hunterlynbiddix Got em.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-05 13:50:50	Baby I got a plan, run away fast as you can.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-08 23:57:52	Model broad with a Hollywood smile.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-09 03:11:28	That still makes my heart sink into my stomach.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-09 04:02:41	Way too much time to think tonight. Need to go to the gym or something.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-09 04:20:08	I've said it once, I've said it twice, I've said it a thousand times, that I'm okay, that I'm fine, that it's all just in my mind.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-09 05:43:58	Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-09 15:40:32	I want to be able to play the piano.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-11 05:11:16	Gotta love when you can have an intellectual conversation with a girl.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-11 16:08:41	All of the sudden I want to watch every episode of Breaking Bad again. Have to make myself read.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-11 17:54:06	Still hearing little things about you, pisses me off.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-11 17:56:24	@Un_Juh_Lee trying to move on, something comes up almost daily.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-11 00:57:39	Big Krit is the man.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-11 01:26:08	Making the mistake I never learn from.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-11 01:31:02	Lol at the people that didn't even want to watch the Walking Dead until like 2 weeks ago.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-11 18:49:09	Subtweets.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-11 19:00:20	That's ironic.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-11 19:56:06	Wow glad you got over that one fast.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-11 19:58:36	Maybe that's what I need.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-12 03:42:33	Don't worry or think about someone that doesn't worry or think about you.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-12 16:44:24	Hate to see y'all frown, but I'd rather see her smile.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-12 02:19:56	That moment when you actually enjoy reading a book that is assigned for a class.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-14 04:16:57	Free throws.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-14 12:44:00	I think I snapped up my neck.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-12 16:56:03	I'd like to say it's been a pleasure.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-14 22:19:24	I think today was a success. Went just how I wanted it to go.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-12 20:36:14	I will always love McDowell. You never forget the place where you grew up.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-12 23:19:19	When your lab teacher only makes you do 2 out of the 8 questions on your data sheet &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-13 17:00:08	Those pre-workouts that have you sweating even before you lift. Love/hate kind of thing.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-13 17:47:41	This dude is working out with a cast on his forearm. #noexcuses
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-16 00:15:22	I hate getting the Vineyard Vines magazines. All these nice things that I can never afford.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-17 19:03:56	I want to make you feel special.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-18 20:32:51	Loud-mouthed girls are the worst. Shut up, you're not attractive.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-20 03:59:27	http://t.co/B8z7I1ra. Best commercial I've seen all day.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-20 04:33:40	These girls ain't got nothing on you.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-10 02:26:21	Hanging out with my dad, watching some UFC.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-10 04:52:22	Tendinitis is no joke.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-10 05:00:56	I've been pushed to the edge a lot lately.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-19 03:28:11	Can't wait until I have my own kitchen.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-19 03:55:22	@meganfoster9 precisely :)
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-10 05:26:40	Since you tellin' on me, tell the world about me.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-20 20:34:04	iPhones. Helping avoid awkward situations since 2007.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-21 00:17:21	A white blank page, with a swelling rage.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-14 01:27:07	This is the first year I won't be home with my dad watching the Carolina Duke game. Gonna miss the hostility.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-14 17:14:23	Trying to look classy for Valentine's Day.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-21 18:38:58	Pooped all over that test.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-15 00:44:52	If you like your Kenwood hot, and your top let back, if your rims sit high, and your windows pitch black. #ti #king #throwbacks
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-21 23:02:53	@YoungValentine1 squat till you puke.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-21 23:05:35	@YoungValentine1 ha I only almost puked after legs once. It was terrible.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-22 00:31:24	@SavannahLace93 the day I went from a L to XL was the best.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-17 23:49:08	@meganfoster9 I have a scarf nomsayin
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-20 02:31:55	I'd love for something to come of us.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-20 03:16:31	"Hey they all look the same anyway. Yeah that's racist, but that's what the CIA are saying." #tosh
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-18 13:35:57	Mmm, hatred.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-18 14:04:02	@YoungValentine1 literally just turned that song on.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-18 14:33:35	What am I afraid of? This is supposed to be what dreams are made of.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-18 14:57:54	It's funny how if you actually read the book and not just wing it, you can do well on quizzes. Might still wing it some though.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-20 16:45:26	As I Lay Dying is bringing all kinds of intensity to this workout.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-22 18:12:52	From debated on to waited on.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-22 21:06:32	There is no "I" in weakness, but there is one in victory.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-22 23:01:12	And it was not your fault but mine, and it was your heart on the line.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-23 17:56:10	This dude is straight mirin' right now.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-26 00:23:31	And you rip it from my hands and you swear it's all gone; and you rip out all I had just to say that you'd won.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-23 22:55:23	Props to Wake today. And you know I'm proud of my Heels.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-26 19:47:25	Literally cannot catch a break.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-26 21:35:43	@Nick_3320 it's always been awesome.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-26 21:36:44	Nothing but blue skies.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-26 23:05:07	I've been running all my life.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-26 23:05:26	Get out of my gym.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-27 14:40:41	@Katie_Orndoff I did the other day and you didn't say anything back.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-27 16:17:22	I hate when you order something, put both physical address and PO Box and somehow they still can't figure it out.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-25 15:57:40	Please Lord help me on this religion test.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-25 17:28:10	Make my grave or animate my veins.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-03-02 20:40:24	They would order me an air filter that doesn't fit. How hard can it be?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-03-03 01:42:43	When family is everything, and money is less important, as long as your momma love ya, don't ever love a woman. #wale

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-02-28 18:44:54	@meganfoster9 @hunterlynbiddix sluts.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-03-05 14:56:37	Those girls that don't wear the sluttiest things they have to the gym but still look great &gt;&gt;&gt;

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-03-06 19:39:06	Hurry and let me know if my exam is cancelled or not. Tired of waiting.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-03-09 19:40:57	I wonder if everyone loves their car as much as I love mine.. Probably not.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-03-11 15:27:05	Woke up at 10.. Thought I'd just sleep for another minute.. Now it's 11:30.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-13 03:40:02	It's setting in that I don't have anything to study for or read, no class tomorrow. Or the next day.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-13 04:45:30	Starving all day long.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-18 04:12:56	It's nice to feel appreciated and loved.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-15 00:40:04	@KaitlinSaunders tell them your boyfriend is a monster.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-15 03:55:30	If I put what I actually thought about what people said and situations that are posted about on social media, I would be banned.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-19 19:15:43	I need my own gym.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-19 20:43:06	@KaitlinSaunders Hey. I miss you.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-20 00:13:43	I think the "to, two, too" thing gets on my nerves worse than the "there"'s. Or, now the people that can't figure out "want" and "won't."
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-20 02:55:38	I should get the owner of the shittiest Internet award. Thanks Frontier.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-20 04:02:32	If you have a long, sweet, important message, you should probably just text it to the person. Not put it on Facebook and then Instagram it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-18 14:43:35	Ready for next Friday night already.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-18 16:06:42	No matter what I do you know I do it to death.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-20 17:15:07	Missing the season finale of Bate's Motel because I will be at work.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-20 17:25:48	@James_keeper94 paper chasing.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-22 18:25:39	Back on the grind.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-18 19:54:20	Banana Republic finally put out their summer shirts. You know I'm buying all of them.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-23 13:17:35	Gotta love when your supervisor tells you that you are doing a great job on the 2nd day of work.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-23 13:34:16	@Nick_3320 haha that may be true.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-21 16:46:26	College is so much better than working full time.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-24 04:23:03	24 more hours. I can do this.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-22 14:12:47	I don't think I've ever been so excited for a weekend in my entire life.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-24 15:23:59	12 hours until I see my girlfriend and I don't think I have ever been more excited in my life.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-26 18:33:33	Ready to be back at App already.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-26 19:16:50	I wish I didn't have the wrists of an 80 year old man.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-26 19:45:46	Ride or die.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-27 04:19:46	I would drive the crap out of a Fiat 500 Abarth.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-27 16:26:18	After getting to be with my girlfriend for 3 days, going back to working 6 days a week is going to be rough.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-28 17:15:29	The fact that I am getting paid tomorrow makes going to work a little less crappy.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-30 04:17:07	@Katie_Orndoff It was like 30. And you also don't text me back for hours and hours.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-30 16:08:52	Wake up, gym, work, sleep, repeat.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-30 16:09:24	She got me up all night, all I'm singing is love songs.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-05-30 16:17:22	I laugh at the people that think you have to drink protein during the 30 minute "anabolic window" or you lose muscle. That makes sense.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-01 04:21:35	My next car will have a 6 speed manual. I miss shifting so much.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-01 17:53:39	I've actually kind of enjoyed work the last couple of days. It's weird.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-02 04:04:39	All that money, the money is the motive.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-02 17:09:24	Don't get stronger. Become strength.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-02 17:42:47	Drinking my pre-workout before I leave and listening to UnderOath is going to get me another ticket. #jamming
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-02 18:44:22	I will have 18 inch arms one day. I'm going to do it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-02 19:57:40	I love the fact that @KaitlinSaunders plans as much as I do. I didn't think anyone could use white boards and sticky notes like I do.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-03 01:26:50	@Jeremiah_JJJ Jeremiah do you want to buy my DSi for $3,000?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-06 00:22:15	Nothing makes me want to smash things quite like ineffective technology.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-06 15:34:36	I miss September through December when nobody is concerned about working out and I have the gym to myself.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-13 01:20:14	Pumped to get an apartment in the future.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-11 17:59:04	Hoping I can actually make some overtime this week. #paper
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-14 04:57:06	Watched conspiracy videos and now I can't sleep. @James_keeper94 and @YoungValentine1 would be proud.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-15 17:57:34	Working Saturday for straight time sucks.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-14 14:20:55	Have to kill this workout and turn this day around.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-14 14:57:01	Can't get my mind right. This sucks.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-14 15:30:47	And we will stand when there is nothing left, tear it to the ground.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-18 04:21:13	Gotta love that several people think that I weigh an easy 205-210.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-18 15:00:06	Bro tanks and sweatpants everyday.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-17 02:37:03	I need a new show to watch.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-17 14:52:36	Kendrick have a dream.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-16 17:28:15	Super worn out today. Sleeping the day away.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-21 15:11:22	I wish people would shut up about others "judging them." Either ignore them or stop doing stuff that people will "judge" you for. #simple
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-21 16:48:46	Training whenever you feel like crap sucks, but it's something that separates the men from the boys.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-21 16:52:00	@Katie_Orndoff haha I came home and passed out afterward. But then the painful reality that I have to leave for work in an hour set in.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-21 16:56:32	Gotta love that fresh haircut feeling.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-22 03:48:35	@YoungValentine1 34 was the highest I ever made it solo.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-22 13:45:20	Finally about to make some overtime pay this week.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-22 15:06:56	Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-24 02:45:18	Control your thoughts, do not let your thoughts control you.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-23 16:03:34	5 more days of work and I get almost 10 days off. Can't come soon enough.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-23 19:15:04	I have a day off and I'm not really sure what to even do with it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-24 17:59:28	5 more days. I can do this.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-26 17:53:07	It's rains every single day before I have to go to work.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-27 04:17:40	I have a super low tolerance for disrespect and stupidity. I've seen a lot of both these past few days.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-27 14:18:19	@James_keeper94 good stuff. I've said screw it, I'm just going for the Dumbbells.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-06-28 13:42:32	One eight hour shift is all that separates me from a 10 day break.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-13 21:40:51	"I need to burn those bridges, so put in that I was fired for theft and groping wieners." #theoffice
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-13 15:47:44	Do not pray for easy lives, pray to be stronger men.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-14 14:51:50	Rain makes me want to sit in the library and get work done all day. It's weird.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-14 20:43:19	Might be getting Battlefield 4 instead of Ghosts.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-14 21:48:52	@Katie_Orndoff fall break starts tomorrow Katherine
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-14 21:58:46	@Katie_Orndoff I'll check my schedule 😘
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-17 03:04:25	Can't get enough White Collar.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-19 02:34:39	@YoungValentine1 haha sticky bombs, my friend.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-21 14:18:15	Gotta love bad news on Monday morning. Starting the week off right.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-21 16:26:11	You know it's real when you are who you think you are.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-22 14:31:32	Gotta love the freshmen with the speaker backpacks. I hate that I could never be that cool.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-23 15:22:48	Shoot to thrill, play to kill.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-23 16:24:59	I feel like the nice guys will win in the end.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-27 02:59:59	I just want a fast car. Is that too much to ask?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-26 22:01:31	So the only home game I don't go to, we are actually going to win. That sounds about right.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-29 04:22:16	So Bullet for my Valentine is playing in Charlotte tomorrow. Really wish I had a ticket.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-29 20:58:45	My philosophy class is the most awkward experience of my life. Every class.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-31 02:39:07	These next two and a half years are going to be challenging, but it will be so worth it in the end.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-31 17:53:39	Dude is dressed as Krillen from DBZ. I want to shake his hand.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-10-31 18:01:51	Next year I am going to get super jacked and be Vageta for Halloween.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-01 17:47:16	Death or Glory.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-03 22:35:23	My dad might be getting a WRX hatchback. What is my life?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-04 21:15:15	So I have two hours to shove all of this accounting knowledge into my brain. Let's go.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-05 18:42:13	If something goes wrong and my documentary that I edited for 12 hours doesn't play, I will hurt someone.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-06 01:19:19	"Who are you gonna date if everybody sucks?" #pessimismatitsbest
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-05 14:30:20	It will be a miracle if I get this project done on time today.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-05 17:25:52	@Jeremiah_JJJ what is your professional opinion on Ghosts?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-07 19:58:18	Spent 14 hours editing a documentary, lost all of my sound files, and by some act of God got the video to work 15 minutes before class.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-11 17:23:39	Getting ready for registration makes me question everything in life.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-09 05:05:16	Finally getting a mic, let's go! @James_keeper94 @gangsta_Drew @YoungValentine1 @Nick_3320 @Spillars13_23 @Jeremiah_JJJ
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-09 18:17:15	Blood, sweat, and years.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-12 17:29:22	Somebody is going to get hurt if I don't get a spot in these classes.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-12 23:49:32	I have a paper due at midnight and I am at the point where I am debating with myself whether or not to even do it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-13 00:28:15	What's the rush on commitment?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-10 00:20:48	Got her looking so hard that her neck hurt.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-13 18:41:01	Can't believe I never drank coffee until this year. It's incredible.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-13 21:41:44	Somehow I forgot to eat lunch. What is happening to me?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-15 18:59:04	I feel like I need a gas mask to go outside right now.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-15 21:46:11	Don't think I don't think about it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-17 02:42:36	Don't nobody play with Cake. @gangsta_Drew @YoungValentine1 @Spillars13_23
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-18 15:58:51	A goal without a plan is just a wish.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-18 17:27:40	Girls complain that chivalry is dead. Just held a door open for this girl; she looked at me like I was stupid. Makes sense.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-14 21:46:19	English Teacher: "how do you feel oppressed?" Kid: "I can't join http://t.co/sLwDzCJkmt." "Are you f****** stupid?" I never laughed so hard.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-16 19:56:35	New brake pads and rotors for the Leggy. #stoppingpower
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-22 01:30:43	Jason Statham is the man.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-22 16:18:58	So much stuff in my head.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-22 18:31:10	Nobody wants to hear your shit music.
About to hurt this kid in the library.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-21 14:33:04	There is so much to get done today.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-20 15:01:12	When family is everything and money is less important, as long as your mama love you, don't ever love a woman. #wale
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-21 16:17:11	Dominating this philosophy paper. If my teachers let me write about Mad Men all the time, I wouldn't hate papers so much.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-21 17:57:01	Was about to slay these liberals in a discussion but the teacher stopped it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-20 18:35:14	@Nick_3320 that is my accounting class exactly.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-20 18:48:52	I want to do something incredible for someone that deserves it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-20 21:07:31	I get to write about Don Draper in my  Philosophy class. #MadMen
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-23 22:59:13	"Just 69 me, no homo." @Nick_3320
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-24 04:07:58	Ha, alright.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-24 15:54:11	Such a fun weekend. @YoungValentine1 @James_keeper94 @Nick_3320 @gangsta_Drew @tylerradford . @tim_is1 knows he is always part of the crew.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-24 20:31:59	Just mapped out everything I have to do before the end of the semester and I think I might be going into depression. #procrastination
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-26 02:51:43	Mom: "Don't come home tonight it's going to snow and ice." Me: "I have a Subaru."
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-27 03:11:28	Cause I see you across the room and you the baddest in the building.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-25 14:58:34	This is a call to war so grab your guns and get your horses. #bmth
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-25 18:54:16	Debating on whether or not it's worth it to go to class tomorrow. Thanksgiving break is sounding pretty good right now.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-28 05:47:28	I wish that I could meet all the stupid kids that talk crap on Call of Duty and hurt them severely.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-28 20:54:45	I promise you that my mom's sweet potato casserole is better than the one you'll have today.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-02 18:02:54	Unless you want to get there at 7am, save yourself the trouble and don't go to the library this week.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-03 16:21:35	I'm just trying to know you better.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-11-29 15:45:03	Wanted to wish a happy birthday to one of my dearest friends. I hope it's incredible. @Katie_Orndoff
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-04 19:16:13	I was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-01 02:55:58	Paul Walker was my favorite ever. Way too young. Way too young.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-01 03:05:50	@Nick_3320 @tylerradford I heard something saying it was a hoax. I hope so.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-06 00:14:34	@meganfoster9 nobody takes 5 hour naps.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-06 00:21:12	@YoungValentine1 @meganfoster9 I feel like you might as well just got to sleep for the night. Now you won't go to bed until 5am
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-06 16:24:25	I can't wait until the day one of these idiots decimates their shoulder from doing those crossfit pull-ups.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-09 15:47:19	I have a possibility to make an A in Accounting if I absolutely dominate this test. That would be incredible.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-09 16:42:19	Hopefully this partial photographic memory will kick in when I need it today.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-08 03:44:33	This portfolio will be the death of me. Probably should have finished my papers earlier in the semester.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-08 18:22:08	If I worked as hard as I have already today all year, I'd have a 4.0
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-08 16:09:38	Alright so now it's really time to hit the books hard. Ready for these 3 days to be over.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-10 15:54:51	Let me find out.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-10 20:27:13	@NatLed20 @morganaduncan @James_keeper94 You're*
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-09 05:36:57	"Fear is never a factor for me Joe Rogan. I'm trying to get some crack rocks." @James_keeper94
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-12 02:18:35	I've slept for about 13 hours today and I am still tired. I am dying.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-12 17:17:32	You need to be able to motivate yourself rather than having to looking to others for motivation.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-12 18:12:34	You remind me of something, I don't know what it is.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-13 16:24:33	@meganfoster9 I took mine back on Tuesday and I was the only one in line.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-13 16:29:06	@meganfoster9 freshman.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-13 17:32:01	You drive an Audi A8 and it looks like it has never been washed. You need to be beaten.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-13 21:11:27	I am going to have to get a suit jacket tailored a ton because of my shoulders. Proud and disappointing moment all at the same time.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-14 23:00:35	Mom and Dad went out so I'm just going to grill my own steaks.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-15 00:29:19	Fast and Furious marathon on Bravo. #yourewelcome

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-21 17:12:28	So the Y gets all new equipment and now there are 47 people in this gym instead of the usual 3.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-25 19:09:02	Got some new gym clothes. Ready to lift.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-25 19:09:34	Also got a K-Cup for Christmas. Drank 4 cups of coffee in about 30 minutes.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-25 21:01:30	Ready to spend this Christmas money on a crazy amount of supplements and fresh kicks.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-30 16:55:19	My time will come.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2013-12-30 19:35:47	My grandma and I just had a 10 minute conversation about White Collar.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-03 20:47:31	I hope that it snows again soon so that I can drive in it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-07 01:35:47	Just cause they try, doesn't mean they can beat us.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-07 17:20:34	Happy birthday! @chelsea_howie
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-06 21:49:21	I really like clever and intelligent women.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-08 01:43:19	Wake up Nick. @Nick_3320
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-10 03:59:43	She knows, and I know she knows.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-10 21:34:17	Me: "I'll probably come home for my birthday." Mom: "Wow how considerate."
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-12 17:54:37	So glad to be back in Boone.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-11 15:29:02	Wow this weather is great.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-13 04:20:41	Shots fired.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-12 05:49:02	@chelsea_howie "Hey guys please turn down the music." "No this is your entrance. Turn Down For What?"
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-13 15:56:44	Sitting directly in the front of the class. Glad I have a class all the way across campus before this one.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-13 17:56:39	@JoCDages happy birthday! :)
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-14 17:16:24	These resolutioners are getting really creative with their exercises.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-14 17:45:48	Wow of course.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-14 19:50:02	My Business Statistics just got cancelled for tomorrow and we don't have class Monday either. I will definitely take that.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-14 14:08:22	@chelsea_howie Thank you Chelsea.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-15 15:57:16	It's ridiculous how much I am going to like this information systems class.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-19 20:51:43	If every workout I had was as good as the one I had today I would be so happy with life.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-21 18:27:11	If classes get cancelled tomorrow then my dreams will come true.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-21 21:26:44	@chelsea_howie better not be leftovers again.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-21 21:34:20	@chelsea_howie how sweet of you. I'll be home after my important executive meeting.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-22 17:45:43	Hadn't seen the new Mac Pro until today. That is incredible.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-21 21:41:28	@chelsea_howie you can't keep making these accusations. We talked about this.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-23 00:03:19	Gotta love getting sick.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-23 14:28:48	Quit changing seats everyday.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-23 14:31:03	@YoungValentine1 it's all these women that can't make up their minds in here.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-22 15:57:28	Half of my class is missing because of the weather.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-23 17:44:42	Way back then thought that we would never have this. I just want it all.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-24 14:34:08	I'd be thrilled to see some 30 degree weather. This is garbage.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-24 19:03:39	@tim_is1 windchill was -15 this morning. 🔫🔫
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-24 19:12:12	@tim_is1 nope. Weather channel said only go out if it is an emergency.
Still had classes.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-26 17:02:27	Glad that was just a dream.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-26 19:40:45	It's freaking summer outside today.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-26 20:42:11	Dead discussion. You will not win because I will not lose.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-29 03:17:09	I am my own worst critic.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-27 17:47:56	My life is a joke today.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-28 15:42:09	My first though when seeing snow outside: "That gym better not be closed today."
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-28 18:20:20	Stressed out about my housing situation next year.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-29 14:35:44	Glad that none of my classes got canceled this morning.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-01 22:12:13	I live for PRs.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-31 17:53:16	The F-Type Jaguars are so sexy.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-30 14:30:02	Wow that sounds about right.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-30 21:36:29	Trap Music.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-31 04:47:09	@morganaduncan I just picked it up today and did that first try.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-01-31 05:00:37	@morganaduncan believe what you'd like.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-03 14:33:12	When the Elder Scrolls Online comes out, that's all I will be doing for 3 months.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-04 14:05:32	So outside it looks like Silent Hill.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-05 04:07:42	I wish some sweet beard growing genetics would kick in soon.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-06 14:29:22	Why can we not sit in the same seats every class? It's almost the fifth week of the semester.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-06 17:56:03	I've been fighting the same old war. They say it's a battle that can't be won.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-05 17:11:37	One thing college has taught me is how to walk skillfully through large crowds of people.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-09 09:16:50	My sleeping schedule is about to be all kinds of messed up.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-09 19:41:48	This don't come with trophies, no envelopes to open. I just do it because I'm supposed to.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-11 23:15:42	Gotta love when naps make you more tired and disoriented than you were before.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-12 05:47:35	I would love to have some snow tires.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-11 05:55:12	@__Sprinkle__ peasants.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-10 04:00:54	I can't make myself write papers. It's the worst.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-12 21:19:46	I think I missed my calling in life to drag/street race and/or drift.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-12 23:01:01	They are playing some Avenged Sevenfold in central. Let's go.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-13 15:16:16	Slept like crap and literally had the same dream for 6 hours.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-13 15:18:02	@sbsmith27 I was looking forward to sleeping all day. I went to bed at 2 and woke up at 8.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-13 16:05:52	They don't, they don't know.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-14 05:04:36	It's midnight. Where is House of Cards season 2?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-14 17:11:05	So many things to get done by midnight tonight.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-15 17:15:18	Waking up for the third day in a row feeling like crap. All I want to do is lift.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-18 23:42:54	"To improve is to change. To perfect is to change often." #HouseOfCards
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-17 14:51:28	Checking for the man of the year, man-man of the year.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-17 17:35:50	T.I. vs. T.I.P. will always be my favorite rap album.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-17 22:53:40	What's going on in that beautiful mind?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-20 04:57:20	The fire rages in me, daylight fights through the night with the cries of redemption. #askylitdrive
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-22 03:34:25	What's good WCU?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-15 02:55:07	Me: "Yeah I took some NyQuil last night. It was incredible." Mom: "Oh that stuff is so great." Dad: "Y'all are some drug addicts."

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-21 06:33:10	Can't sleep because I'm coughing and it's miserably hot.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-23 06:52:46	Girl you can tell everybody.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-25 17:06:40	Tendinitis in my wrist and elbow. Still won't stop.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-24 16:59:02	"By the way your test is on Wednesday." So there's that.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-24 17:17:48	How interesting.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-26 00:27:04	My accounting website is having scheduled maintenance right now. The day before my test. Yep.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-27 16:25:38	Go and get it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-24 20:35:23	I could trade my car and throw in some cash for an '04 WRX or an '01 BMW M3 but I know I will get a speeding ticket in the first week.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-26 19:49:45	Time management is critical for this next week.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-26 20:01:23	And if your mirror won't make it any clearer, I'll be the one to let you know.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-02-28 06:13:12	Don't think about it too much.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-02 19:27:26	Money baby, money baby.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-02 03:49:03	Shout out to @Jeremiah_JJJ for all the good love jams.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-03 17:00:33	I have zero tolerance for disrespect. That's the way I was raised.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-04 01:33:49	@laurel5125 education comes first.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-05 05:15:27	So ready to get a fresh haircut.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-06 15:16:39	Why would you skip class on review day? Rookie mistakes being made.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-05 21:05:25	Let's get these essays rolling.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-07 06:08:59	Praying for a miracle with this midterm tomorrow.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-07 15:11:42	I will build a rally car.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-07 13:35:49	Well the miracle I needed for this exam came through. No classes.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-07 13:40:38	But getting out of here is about to be nightmare.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-14 03:24:26	A victory dance, a burning riot. We will, we will, we will rise again.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-13 05:35:04	Having some of the best talks tonight. @chelsea_howie
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-11 19:41:57	Kind of want a Go-Pro to put on my car and do dumb stuff with.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-17 14:43:11	See I like to screw myself over grade-wise at the beginning of the semester and pull out some kind of miracle ending.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-17 19:55:45	Listening to the first album I ever bought. Hard to believe it came out in 2006. #Decemberunderground
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-19 21:58:26	Why are there so many abstract questions in my accounting class? This stuff is so straightforward.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-18 15:22:12	This is my year. 180 pounds and cut up. #gogetit
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-20 15:10:02	Having an incredible day so far.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-20 15:12:13	@YoungValentine1 there is something weirdly satisfying about not being able to walk the next two days.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-20 16:37:34	@YoungValentine1 come train some back with me today. I'll be sore tomorrow haha. #rowsforthehoes

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-22 21:25:28	Have to keep that executive mindset. About to make things happen.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-23 14:58:21	It shouldn't bother me as much as it does.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-23 00:32:30	Throw that back.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-24 17:54:50	Let's hope I can learn 3 chapters of Business Statistics by Wednesday.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-24 22:35:00	So ready for #BatesMotel tonight.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-25 14:55:10	My mom texts me to talk about #BatesMotel

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-26 16:36:56	How hard is it to comprehend that you aren't supposed to talk on the third floor? It blows my mind.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-26 20:44:39	This is the only class I've ever had where people show up 20 minutes before it actually starts.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-27 04:14:58	Too much time to think.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-30 16:49:08	Mad Men Season 6 on Netflix. Let's go.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-30 21:41:13	@YoungValentine1 Not until Tuesday at 3. It's a free-for-all at App.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-03-30 21:43:25	@YoungValentine1 No we go by credit hours. My schedule is about to suck and I am going to be a junior. It's ridiculous.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-04-09 18:04:58	Just walked through a tunnel of kids and every one of them high-fived me.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-04-09 20:41:18	But the iron saved me, through plates and a bar.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-04-13 15:29:18	Wish this gym would hurry up and open.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-04-11 03:16:13	I go from "let's see what I can get ahead on for next week" to "how bad will this actually hurt my grade?"

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-04-23 14:58:38	Wore sweatpants because it was 40 degrees when I left the room. Really regretting that decision right now.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-04-24 16:13:08	What would a workout be without every tendon in my arm hurting? No fun at all.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-04-24 16:55:38	@YoungValentine1 I feel the pain. Trying to row the 135s next week.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-04-24 16:59:29	@YoungValentine1 next time I bulk I'm doing back twice a week. Getting some wings
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-04-24 17:09:30	@VaughnHarley @YoungValentine1 I feel like that statement is invalid.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-05-01 13:40:18	Don't really have time to lift today because of these papers... Probably still going to the gym.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-05-01 22:54:16	Worked almost constantly for 4 hours today and I still feel like I accomplished nothing.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-05-02 00:10:38	My paper writing turned into me watching street races on YouTube.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-05-05 21:31:21	Love it when you spend countless hours on assignments and actually get good grades on them.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-05-30 17:52:31	If this hail hurts my car I will be beyond pissed.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-06-03 14:36:36	Got my heart racing like there's nothing to it.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-06-17 02:19:50	Got an email from the Subaru dealership saying Happy Two Year Anniversary. I do love that car.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-06-19 13:32:20	ATL Bound.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-06-19 21:02:16	Saw a Brabus Mercedes, an Audi RS6, F Type Jaguar, 2 Ferraris, and some Bentleys today in Atlanta.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-06-20 21:43:59	Going to the Georgia Aquarium with my lady.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-06-23 12:30:37	I need about 4 more cups of coffee this morning.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-06-26 02:27:58	Stung 6 times by yellow jackets. Feels great.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-07-04 13:03:27	I really did mean to buy an American Flag bro tank for today.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-07-05 18:04:50	Struggling today.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-07-05 14:51:31	4 and a half hours of sleep and feeling great. Have a feeling I'm going to crash hard later.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-07-09 21:39:25	Hold on wait a minute, y'all thought I was finished?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-07-10 21:29:23	Super setting vertical and horizontal pulls. #iwantwings #stupidpump
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-07-17 16:05:44	Kings Dominion is playing UKF Drum and Bass at their park.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-07-18 11:27:45	Ready to be home again.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-07-18 14:07:15	I need to lift.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-07-18 16:18:36	Some baby making music playing at this Zaxby's right now.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-07-18 22:51:05	I miss that woman more than anything.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-07-24 00:12:21	After not seeing Lauren for a month, tomorrow we will both be in Boone and I couldn't be more excited.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-07-24 15:37:37	5 hours.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-07-29 12:24:40	Had a dream that I bought a black MKIV Supra. Now I'm awake and pretty disappointed.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-07-31 12:42:31	Last day of work.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-03 02:15:44	Moving into my apartment tomorrow afternoon. So ready to be back in Boone.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-02 16:00:50	Just saw a bagged out FRS with a body kit in Marion. So sexy.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-03 15:32:41	@NatLed20 if you are invited.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-03 15:36:09	@NatLed20 you know you have the VIP pass. Aka the bow tie
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-03 15:40:25	@NatLed20 it's coming with me to Boone.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-14 04:25:16	@James_keeper94 @NatLed20 Having a good time with Dale.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-12 00:11:11	Love being able to have my own kitchen. Apartment life is where it's at.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-15 01:12:00	12 hours until I have the greatest internet of my life.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-15 14:26:50	@NatLed20 bruh.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-15 14:52:46	Charter you the real MVP.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-19 19:17:25	I love having the same professors and already knowing how they grade and teach.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-20 04:12:49	Ridiculously tired all day until midnight.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-22 15:04:36	There's nobody better than her.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-22 20:43:15	Third cup of coffee today.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-23 22:39:00	It is obnoxiously hot in this apartment.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-27 19:44:48	No time to be sick, I have to lift.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-28 20:49:38	5-7:30 class on Thursday. Let's go.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-08-28 20:51:30	@YoungValentine1 bruh
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-10 16:00:07	12 hours until this research proposal is due. It's a stressful time.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-10 22:20:44	Once this paper is done, I have nothing to worry about for a week. That's the dream.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-11 02:21:09	“@_LiftingProbz_: Play me in 2k. Me: http://t.co/eWDTiboDmH” @gangsta_Drew @YoungValentine1 @Spillars13_23 @James_keeper94
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-12 21:47:46	The first thing I do when I get home is pet my dog for a solid 15 minutes.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-15 03:20:22	@YoungValentine1 And that AC Unity.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-15 03:20:46	@YoungValentine1 And Elder Scrolls and Grand Theft Auto.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-15 03:25:10	@YoungValentine1 I'm just saying I'm excited for them. It's going to be a rough time for my grades.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-15 05:10:58	Why am I awake?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-13 03:29:38	@NatLed20 @James_keeper94 bruh
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-15 21:06:43	Way too much alone time with my thoughts.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-16 13:54:20	I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, now smile. #throwbacks
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-18 04:51:13	Sleepless about you.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-17 20:38:33	Absolutely cherish the time I have had with you.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-22 02:01:49	Slowly drifting, drifting away, wave after wave.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-22 04:20:19	Why are you blaring music on a Sunday night?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-23 23:56:38	"Don't eat the ice, it tastes like ass." @James_keeper94
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-24 20:52:18	Literally every watch I click on is $8,000. Depressing.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-23 18:52:50	Really excited about the next few years of my life and what is to come.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-27 16:45:16	Just saw an R35 GTR in Marion. Today is a good day.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-27 00:15:06	New seasons of HIMYM, New Girl, and Parks and Rec. all in one week. Netflix is the real MVP right now.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-27 14:09:50	Definitely going to have to use the slow-mo camera on the iPhone 6 to record some drifting in the snow this winter.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-29 15:28:51	How long until the tables turn?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-30 16:45:53	Creating a survey is harder than it sounds.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-30 03:06:19	Casually ignoring the 3 papers I have to do this week. Won't end well but right now it's alright.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-09-28 19:41:23	I had to leave all that alone to get my mind right.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-01 17:19:49	Jon Hamm was on Parks and Rec. for 20 seconds and it was awesome.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-02 12:56:53	Getting up early, drinking coffee, and getting work done.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-02 19:39:23	Waiting for this to get easier.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-05 03:23:31	Dudes next door are jamming to some classic Panic! at the Disco.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-05 22:51:13	"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit."
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-09 20:52:09	First midterm at 5. Hoping to keep these grades high.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-11 03:44:25	Vices like Vipers.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-11 20:30:14	Just lifted a girl for 21 points. We are App State.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-12 01:26:50	My heart breaks over what has happened today. I can't think of a more God-loving, incredible man.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-12 19:44:39	Spending time with lots of caffeine and my intermediate accounting book.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-14 12:48:48	This wind is annoying.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-13 22:07:53	I refuse to let this accounting test defeat me.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-20 21:26:11	It will be everything you ever dreamed.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-21 23:01:37	I have had @bmthofficial 's #DROWN on repeat for the last hour.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-23 14:03:52	Just calculated what I would need for Chancellor's List. Extremely stressful but I think it can be done.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-23 18:13:14	I promise I have zero time for that.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-23 20:47:45	She ask me if I do this everyday. I say "often."
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-23 22:31:00	It's crazy how people can let one other person control all of their happiness.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-24 17:47:42	When some random dude comes over just to dap you up after a set, you know you've been putting in work in the gym.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-24 18:29:05	@Katie_Orndoff @saransley @RachelMcAttack I'm partaking as well ladies.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-26 13:35:45	Feeling like this is getting really old.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-26 19:56:28	It's incredible how much the gym can change your mood.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-25 23:04:02	I don't want to think about that right now, heat of the moment.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-28 13:53:35	I hate how much I have let this get to me.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-02 04:12:57	Carolina is the absolute place to be.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-10-31 17:22:44	On my way ladies. @Katie_Orndoff @RachelMcAttack @saransley
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-01 04:12:29	Best night.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-05 13:37:58	Taking control of the senate is what I like to see.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-08 04:16:08	@tCannada best album there is
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-06 15:55:00	You know I had to do it for ya.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-10 16:41:29	All is fair in love and war, or so they tell me.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-10 05:58:21	I don't know why this still keeps me up at night.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-15 01:02:30	It comes in waves, I close my eyes, hold my breath and let it bury me.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-15 05:11:32	Something extraordinarily great has to be coming my way with all the shit I've dealt with the past few years.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-17 01:40:17	Why did I wait until tonight to start this research?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-17 12:58:24	I'm just testing how well I work under pressure. It's not procrastination.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-18 15:22:04	You must expect great things of yourself before you can do them.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-19 14:10:39	I'm sick and it feel like 5 degrees outside. Still walking to the gym this morning.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-25 00:37:06	Why have I pushed this paper until now?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-24 14:49:12	Coming to the sad realization that thanksgiving break will be me working on 3 different projects the entire time.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-11-30 02:35:05	This is the next level of stress.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-01 01:21:36	If I can get this balance sheet to balance tears will probably be shed.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-01 04:14:49	I know your motives, and you know mine.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-02 20:08:45	How is ASU's wifi completely non-functional?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-04 14:15:51	15 more pages need to be written before tomorrow night. Really not looking forward to that.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-04 14:35:25	@JShillz Same thing happened to me two weeks ago in intermediate. Apparently nobody needs review.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-04 14:54:27	@JShillz asked my professor what was on the final. "It's an overview of the book."
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-08 14:36:08	It's do or die at this point.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-07 19:07:50	I don't think I've ever worked as hard as I have been this past week. Really hoping my grades reflect that.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-05 20:42:38	@tCannada aka more preworkout.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-09 02:03:10	@NatLed20 Bruh this is my entire life.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-09 13:11:00	I've never had so much riding on one exam before in my entire life.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-11 20:07:31	Two final grades back already. 94 and 96. I'll take it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-14 02:30:33	Thought you had it all figured out back then, girl, how bout now?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-24 20:01:06	Hard work.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-29 23:56:17	I'm ready to go back to school already.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2014-12-30 22:17:50	I think if I learned one thing this year it is to not let one other person control whether or not you are happy. Happiness is a choice.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-01-09 20:22:37	If you've got the wrong impression, girl not for long.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-01-12 20:35:25	Satan himself must be responsible for this stand-still in the parking deck.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-01-22 20:12:04	@tCannada why are you wearing the same shoes as me Tyler?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-01-28 03:47:50	Downloaded the new J. Cole, Logic, Lupe, Big K.R.I.T., and Partynextdoor Two. Insanely good stuff.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-01-31 17:06:01	@ShamanOG I hope you play even half as good as me. You'll win.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-02 03:01:00	And all for nothing.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-02 21:39:35	Thank God for that AWD. Drifting on the way to class.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-01 04:16:51	Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-02 02:58:14	The Lord Almighty hand His hand on that catch.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-03 15:20:07	Two weeks.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-03 22:40:25	This dude in Quinn is getting away with running with no shirt. Next time I lift I'm doing the same then.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-08 07:35:47	But girl what's better than this?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-10 03:32:37	If you don't listen to the Alternative R&amp;B playlist on Spotify you're missing out.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-13 16:59:03	She ask me where you moving, I say on to better things. #10bands
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-13 17:55:16	I've had four cups of coffee today already and somehow I'm alright with that.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-14 04:53:16	My mind is by far my greatest enemy.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-16 20:31:03	Strongly debating going for a drive in the snow. #subarurallyteam
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-17 22:01:16	There is nothing more fun than dumping it in first gear and drifting around a corner. Loving this snow.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-18 18:28:17	Classes cancelled until 10am Friday. My exam is at 10am Friday. Why does this happen to me?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-18 03:04:59	Please God let the snow cancel my Health Law exam.. Again.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-17 14:08:47	It would also help if I read my emails correctly.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-18 23:51:17	@NatLed20 windchill of -30 here so
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-21 14:29:57	The best night.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-02-25 22:41:37	@GHaigler you know Witmer is furious.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-06 03:16:48	Don't waste my time.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-09 23:32:35	Why are Bates Motel and The Following on at the same time? Why do I have to make this choice?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-14 01:56:19	Lol my life is almost comical.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-14 14:42:19	As soon as I start making great squat gains my ankle has to mess up.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-14 15:00:14	@Madalyn_Davis tape it up and keep going!
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-14 15:05:17	@Madalyn_Davis hopefully. I'm supposed to have a 400 hour internship done this summer so I might have to go before or after work.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-14 15:06:26	@Madalyn_Davis 40 hrs a week for 10 weeks haha
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-15 20:47:35	This week is going to be a mental test. Ready to handle it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-13 21:27:07	You'd think I'd learn to stop getting my hopes up at this point.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-15 16:36:45	Finally watched the Keynote for the new MacBook. I'm really not sure how Apple can improve from this. Insane technology.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-19 14:04:07	Genuinely questioning if studying is even going to help me at this point.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-19 20:56:06	Hoping for a miracle.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-21 01:47:02	Downtown Charlotte is treating me right.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-22 03:51:20	"I've learned to find something nice and accept the rest."
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-20 12:59:37	@NatLed20 jackhawk 9000, available at Walmart.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-23 02:38:50	Doing it is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-23 12:28:20	Like I say every semester, I always have one class that I set myself up for pulling out a miracle at the end.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-24 02:53:29	Really think I like who I'm becoming.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-24 13:37:57	Registering for senior classes on Friday. I think I am having a quarter-life crisis at this point.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-03-25 22:05:19	Stay up late at night thinking about my life, want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin. #ovo

*Goes to gym instead*
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-02 02:07:18	Very excited about what is in store for me this summer. Really love my major.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-02 21:34:36	And I know she knows.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-05 21:09:51	I've always loved OS X but I have to admit that Windows 8 is fresh.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-02 23:53:21	Just downloaded Hulu Plus. Moving up in the world.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-08 19:15:40	@tCannada That's why you go to Quinn.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-08 20:07:05	I live my life by To-Do lists on 3x5 notecards.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-10 11:53:38	And it's that time of year again where my room is an inferno at all times.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-11 18:30:22	If Boone could just stay sunny and 65 forever that would be great.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-11 20:24:09	Thinking about my Intermediate exam Friday makes me want to throw up.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-13 20:16:23	The worst tendinitis I have ever felt in my life.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-16 12:37:14	Feeling weirdly okay about my Intermediate exam tomorrow.. which makes me think I am missing something huge.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-16 20:11:17	T-minus 21 hours until my exam. Do or die.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-19 18:32:34	I'm Just barely getting started, you already upset.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-23 21:23:46	I love how the printers in the library are literally always broken.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-25 22:09:11	My 11 year old cousin has 1,200 followers on Instagram.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-25 03:54:09	Exciting day in the College of Health Sciences.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-26 18:25:56	This kid next to me in the library is the hardest typer I have ever seen in my life. He is about to break the keyboard.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-25 13:57:47	10 hours of sleep is good for the soul.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-28 14:21:10	They gon' love me for my ambition. Easy to dream a dream though it's harder to live it.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-27 02:23:07	Mad Men is the greatest. #TheFinalEpisodes
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-27 17:31:50	The only computer I can get in the whole library is the slowest Mac you've ever seen and won't open Excel. How.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-29 19:53:26	Can't wait to get Lasik eye surgery. Contacts are annoying.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-30 13:56:22	If I can just make it through tomorrow..
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-04-30 16:21:55	Last day of Intermediate II.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-05-01 10:28:57	Today is my nightmare.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-05-04 14:13:14	You would honestly think by now I'd learn to stop getting my damn hopes up.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-05-04 16:08:29	Training hard is good for the soul.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-05-05 21:42:04	This is the time that I wish I would have actually taken good notes in my Art History class.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-05-07 15:34:22	@tCannada part two of my final.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-05-08 10:12:12	No it's cool I only wanted 5 hours of sleep anyway.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-05-09 02:15:56	@GHaigler You should get the Intermediate III tomorrow and start reading it every night. No more for me.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-05-09 00:39:33	Weird to think that I don't have anything to study for tonight.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-05-08 14:42:19	I just want my grades please.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-05-09 18:15:42	I got credit for Intermediate II after horribly failing the first exam. Could have dropped and given up. Believe in yourself.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-05-11 21:37:19	"Why The Dad Bod Is Worse Than Ebola" https://t.co/Y6ePeVwV8S via @YouTube Best thing I've watched in a while.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-05-23 16:17:30	Nothing makes me want to smash things more than technology that doesn't work.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-05-22 15:52:11	@NatLed20 you're full of philosophy today Nathan.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-05-30 00:46:37	But first off i'ma start by saying this.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-05-30 19:49:26	Who you know got it like that?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-06-05 17:49:53	It's only June and I'm already tired of having no A/C.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-06-09 02:05:36	@AbbyHDuffy do you not?
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-06-08 14:23:21	The Legacy is starting to have problems and I am not happy about it.

321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-06-14 17:28:06	They don't even make 'em like you no more.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-06-15 01:17:44	I've eaten 2 full containers of blueberries today. I have to stop.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-06-13 14:05:03	Man I love sinus infections.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-06-13 17:23:38	Just got a free chipotle bowl. My day is looking up.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-06-15 14:38:29	Going to the library simply because it has AC and my apartment doesn't. This is miserable.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-06-16 12:57:41	Today is going to be incredible.
321717597	DanielGibbs3	2015-06-17 19:23:09	Windows 8 is garbage.
