330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-03-16 16:59:46	@mikewellsauthor This is a really great habit to get into.  Even if you write 1 word...that one word gets you closer to your final chapter
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-03-16 17:03:23	@janmoran That's exactly what I'll be doing today!  Even when I think a chapter is finished, I somehow manage to edit it again lol
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-03-16 17:21:49	@janmoran So true!  I am going to take advantage of the kiddos being at thier grandmas.  Peace and quiet is such a rare commodity lol
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-03-16 17:28:54	@lindajnance I read the first few paragraphs and man oh man... the emotion I felt.  I am really impressed and can't wait to read the rest!

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-03-30 01:58:43	It’s said that true love can follow you from one life to the next, implanting memories into a new soul in hope it finds who it's meant for

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-05-21 23:52:17	The best part about knowing a writer is regardless of how they feel about you, if you become a character in their story, you live forever.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-05-22 05:14:29	Goodnight world!
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-05-22 16:15:54	Pet peeve of the day: When you miss a phone call, call the person back two seconds later and they don't answer.  ;)
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-05-22 21:33:15	On your darkest days think of one thing that's made you smile and move on.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-05-21 01:26:26	Sometimes things fall apart so better things can come together.

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-05-25 03:52:46	@JacksonPaulBaer I would have to say my 4yr old daughter Kirra because in her eyes I'm a hero and she means the world to me :)
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-05-25 04:01:21	Hand sanitizer + paper cut = worst pain ever. I think it's even worse than stubbing my toe.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-05-25 04:06:06	@KhaledTalib no kidding right! Lol
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-05-25 04:12:12	@KhaledTalib When your toes are cold and you stub them...man that's like breaking a bone. It definitely brings tears to my eyes.

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-06-11 04:12:42	Stormy night = 2 dogs, 1 cat, and my four year old daughter in bed with me. I'll definitely need coffee in the morning.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-06-11 19:08:58	Focus on how far you've come, not how far you have to go.

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-06-23 03:22:32	I've decided to set out in search of the "fountain of youth" that way when I discover it my dog can drink from it and live forever.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-06-26 00:28:03	I believe a sock monster is living in my washer.  Apparently my socks are so tasty it feels the need to eat 1 sock from each pair.

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-09-11 21:54:27	Do you believe in ghosts?  If so, do you believe they're more active on #Halloween
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-09-11 21:56:45	@Diavuno You say that now...just wait until something scary grabs your ankle while your sleeping and pulls you off the bed ;)  mwhaha
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-09-11 22:01:12	There is such a place where true love exists, and past lives cross. #crimsonforest #truelovereborn http://t.co/HWCDtaAiyW
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-09-11 22:03:26	@Diavuno man, a spider can be just scary if not more so than a ghost!

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-09-17 16:41:24	Love comes unexpectedly to those who least expect to find it ;)
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-09-16 18:42:58	Sometimes all you have to do is FORGET what you FEEL and REMEMBER what you DESERVE.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-09-16 18:44:50	It might take a year, it might take a day, but what's meant to be will always find a way.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-09-16 18:46:04	People who shine from within don't need the spotlight.

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-09-30 19:35:24	If you're going to talk about me in another language as I'm waiting on you, you better make sure I can't understand what you're saying  ;)
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-01 02:16:50	There are 3 virtues I find extremely sexy in a man: 1.)Honesty, 2.)Loyalty, 3.)Love...Jealousy is not one of them.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-09-29 15:03:20	Whew, last day of editing. (Wipes sweat from brow)
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-02 14:45:08	Coolest feeling ever = connecting with a movie producer!
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-04 01:01:00	Editing...will it ever end ;) Probably not.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-07 04:19:28	Writer's don't sleep, they edit.

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-16 02:19:50	#YoureMoreAttractiveIf  you wear really awesome smelling cologne.   Deodorant is a plus too ;)
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-14 11:46:49	Creative minds are rarely tidy.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-14 18:43:42	@Diavuno I never, ever want to see a camel spider in person. Ever lol
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-14 18:45:53	@Diavuno and for Spider Fight Club I suggest The Camel Spider vs. The Male Goliath Bird-Eating Spider ;)
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-14 18:50:33	@Diavuno yeah...I'm good with staying away from some big, scary spiders. Anything with 8 hairy legs can stay away from me ;)
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-15 00:30:18	@NautaY_bY_NatuR I'm glad!!! Must've been those imaginary cookies I made you ;) they were so good I am going to make you some real ones ;)
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-15 00:46:05	Today I thought about borrowing a 65" tv, so when my 11yr old walks in I can switch on "IT" jumping out at her.Does that make me a mean mom?
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-14 18:33:28	It's a good day at work when you can laugh at your coworkers while they chase and capture spiders, creating spider fight club in a cup.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-18 18:39:55	I need to find my Dentyne Ice partner so I can write our names in ice crystals on a window.  I mean, who wouldn't want to blow ice.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-18 18:42:38	I'm in the mood for a gory movie.  I think I'll go eat some popcorn and watch me some Carrie tonight.  #YouWillKnowHerName
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-18 18:44:21	I'm in desperate need of a #Starbucks coffee.  I'm slowly fading away...
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-18 18:52:25	Some drama in your life is perfectly healthy.  It reminds you that you're a "real" person and not some fake, perfect, wanna be.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-18 18:53:29	@Diavuno I tried that already, it didn't have quite the same flavor ;)
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-18 18:55:28	One day, in the near future, I'm going to #NewYork where I plan on shopping until I drop.  I may need a partner in crime, any takers ;)
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-18 19:12:56	@Diavuno Let's do it!!  I'm thinking we need to get some coupons from @couponsNYCity.  Shopping AND saving money.  Oh heck yes!!
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-18 19:13:59	Tweeting on Twitter is like talking to the universe.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-18 19:33:13	If you're going to call me from a "Blocked" phone number, be prepared to listen to it ring.  Only ninja's deserve #Blockedphonenumbers.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-18 20:08:06	Making lots of mistakes and then learning from them helps you become the person you're meant to be.  That's #life.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-18 20:46:48	It's almost 5 o'clock somewhere!!
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-18 20:49:09	That moment when you have to sneeze...and the damn thing won't come out.  #momentsthatsuck
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-18 20:52:39	I've never....yeah that's not such a fun game anymore
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-18 20:59:04	My most overused word of the day today = "Duh."  It just falls out of my mouth like word vomit.  I guess there are worse words to say.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-18 23:43:28	There is no better feeling than a fresh, clean, warm hoodie to put on right after it comes out of the dryer.  I'm feeling snugly soft.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-19 22:53:14	How is it that I had cartoons like "Winnie the Pooh" and "Garfield" while my kids have these weird cartoons like "Uncle Grandpa?"
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-23 00:23:41	Everyone needs a day away from the world to recharge their soul.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-21 21:47:07	Today is a tired day. I need some energy.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-22 00:34:29	Every time I'm on hold with my cell phone provider, I feel like I lose a little piece of my soul.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-25 02:27:59	People aren't always going to be there for you, that's why you learn to handle things on your own.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-25 02:34:19	It's not a competition, relax, we're all crazy here.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-25 02:35:10	Best feeling ever = Texting someone and getting a reply right away.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-25 11:52:10	The stronger the coffee, the better the day will be.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-25 18:23:04	@DefJamRecords I only follow the best ;) Have a great day! &lt;3

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-24 12:16:56	Two kids home with the flu. Not a great way to start vacation.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-24 13:19:54	If you believe in yourself, others will believe in you.

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-24 17:07:18	@TylerDerps right! Now poor Kirra is suck too :( Tis' the season I suppose.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-24 21:06:39	Never change who you are for anyone because nobody can can play your role better than you. So be yourself, and show the world how you shine.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-24 23:01:14	Two wrongs never make a right.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-25 00:01:11	People will stare. Make it worth their while.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-25 00:03:45	Every time you find humor in a difficult situation, you win.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-25 00:10:10	Be the kind of person that hugs the broken hearted so tight, their shattered pieces begin to stick back together.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-25 00:22:21	Time heals all wounds, but some of those wounds are so deep, they leave scars.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-29 00:18:34	Scary movie time.  The Conjuring looks intriguing. #ScaryMovieMonth
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-10-25 17:58:30	The sound of a chainsaw at Halloween still scares the crap out of me.

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-03 04:21:39	Insomnia is not my friend. It does not need to follow me to bed or on Twitter.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-03 12:59:15	Tip of the day - If you're going to watch a Christmas Hallmark movie make sure you have a box of Kleenex next to you.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-01 03:56:24	Truth or Dare? #flashback

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-03 14:09:03	There are quite a few people in this world who feed off of drama. Be the one to make them starve.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-03 14:23:22	It's not what happens when you hit the bottom, it's what you do about it to get yourself back up. #inner-strength #confidence

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-01 18:45:12	When life hands you lemons, pitch the lemons and grab some chocolate.  It makes everything better.  At least that's my theory.  #chocolate
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-01 18:47:25	Sasquatch was just spotted at McDonalds.  Oh wait, I forgot it's #NoShaveNovember
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-02 02:15:16	Being a bully to someone because you think it makes you look tough only makes you look like an idiot.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-02 02:20:03	@MominaWQ @crystalbookland Amen to that!!! I mean, wth is wrong with people these days?
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-02 02:25:42	@MominaWQ @crystalbookland Even on social media sites its ridiculous. I literally want to smack sense into them through my computer screen.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-02 02:29:28	They should create "protection" for stick people stickers so they can't reproduce on the rear window of cars. #truth
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-02 12:35:42	I must have been a good girl this year. Santa Claus is following me! #Christmas
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-04 11:40:31	@DavidBooker25 I like possessing cars ;) Especially the older classic ones lol. They even made a movie about me once. Have a great day!
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-02 22:46:10	Holy crap, is it possible for a human to turn into a Popsicle because I think I'm on the verge of it happening #freezing
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-04 19:39:24	After all the crappy birthdays I've had, I have to say, today has been the best birthday I've ever had ;) I'm feeling pretty special &lt;3

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-06 23:14:41	Rain and wet leaves on the road...not a great combination.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-07 01:29:25	Never underestimate your worth.  In someone else's eyes, you're priceless.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-07 01:48:49	Want to see a perfect relationship?  Watch a movie.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-07 01:52:23	Scooby Doo taught us that the real monsters are humans.  Best lesson ever.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-07 01:58:56	Tip of the day: Don't steal.  The government doesn't like competition.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-07 17:05:57	Why do people have this crazy idea that if you write a book you're immediately going to quit your job and be famous? #amwriting
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-08 02:31:39	Ever feel like the pictures your friends post of you kind of make you look like this? http://t.co/FPe3urUqtU
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-10 15:17:11	Be wary, for some of your best friends are wolves dressed in sheep's clothing.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-08 01:25:35	@missrobinson222 @AngelDemon31415 @fl0WRobin @zee_dad Well here's a BIG Twitter hug for you!! &lt;3

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-10 01:48:10	Timeouts aren't just for children, sometimes adults need them too.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-13 15:36:28	It's a snuggie and hot chocolate kind of day.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-13 19:31:25	A book a day keeps reality away. #amreading
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-14 01:49:42	“You of all people should know how it feels to lose the one you love.” My words stung, “Jealousy is truly an ugly disease.” #amwriting

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-22 05:03:34	Yeah, I like Harry Potter and Zombie movies...so what.  I also like mudding, camping, shopping, and all things pink.  #different #tomgirl

330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-21 13:10:50	Cold, rainy morning. How I wished I lived in Hawaii or some place tropical.
330599302	ChristineGabrie	2013-11-21 14:36:15	There are some days I wish I could cast a magic spell on certain people so when they lied their noses would grow like Pinocchio. #shamey
