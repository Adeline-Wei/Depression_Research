333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-25 19:17:56	When is your Christianity on display? Only on Sundays at church? Or during the week for the world to see?
333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-24 02:04:45	(Titus 2:11) For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people.

333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-25 02:39:23	Great God keep my focus on you and my longing only for your Will! Anchor my heart and mind in the deep inherent truth of your Word!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-25 15:43:12	What do you pursue? Knowledge or wisdom and understanding.
333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-29 00:29:32	@BradyGraves16 is an example to why I'm convinced I'm called to youth/family ministry!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-29 00:33:13	@madison96lynn the lady above all other ladies when it comes to being lady like!!

333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-27 03:03:55	@BradyGraves16 nah just made aware of the weakness and insufficiency in myself! And the completeness and inherent truth of Gods Word!! üòçüòòüòç
333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-27 14:17:32	There are to many men who have the spiritual maturity of a toddler in today's Church! It's time to eat meat now!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-28 04:16:03	If you discredit someone's walk because of their past you are blatantly saying that The Grace of Christ is insufficient!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-30 17:56:19	@Zachyy0880 dude I got a league oh and we need to hang out soon brother!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-30 18:43:56	@Zachyy0880 I need your email
333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-31 04:35:04	Johnny P &amp; JMac have got my back!!    @JohnPiper  @johnmacarthur
333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-28 20:16:20	Truth dose not operate outside the realm of Grace. And Grace can not be applicable without the foundation of Truth!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-28 20:27:06	@JasConEd does*
333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-31 13:56:05	The season of idolatry is back guard your hearts football is a game not a god! And this is coming from a fan of the sport!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-09-01 03:33:04	@MRobertReynolds is my main man!!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-09-01 03:44:23	So when is the last time you prayed with your mouth closed and your ears open?
333480690	JasConEd	2013-09-01 04:18:18	I don't want a life that soots me I desire a life that aligns up exactly with what you will for me!!

333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-29 17:38:50	Theology is an important! But it is meaningless outside of the Gospel!!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-29 18:13:22	If your mindset is "I'm saved because I claim Christianity" yet you live in sin and disobedience your eschatology is flawed! (Romans 6: 1-4)
333480690	JasConEd	2013-09-01 14:02:42	The guitar tracks for the upcoming "No Longer Still" single are finished! Now it's time to write and lay vocals! Lord speak through me!!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-08-29 19:48:37	Calvinist or Arminian do not stray from the Gospel brothers and sisters! Gospel-Centered only then is theology appropriately applicable.
333480690	JasConEd	2013-09-01 17:08:37	When you realize the approval of men means nothing compared to the call to a life of obedience to Christ! #legit
333480690	JasConEd	2013-09-01 21:47:04	Don't simply live for God. Live because of God as well. Always remembering you're now alive because of the price Christ paid on the Cross!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-09-02 02:56:28	A lesson is meaningless if you never take the time to apply what you've learned!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-09-02 05:33:14	@Zachyy0880 let me check oh and come play metal again

333480690	JasConEd	2013-09-03 22:30:53	One does not simply listen to @GideonAL in the shower without stomp kicking the shower curtain of its hanger!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-09-04 02:18:17	A hunger for the Word is found in the Word. What a beautiful paradox!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-09-04 05:18:17	@MrPoncheezy @BradyGraves16  we shall activate tomorrow!!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-09-03 01:21:08	Theology is fantastic when used as a tool in ministry but is dangerous when constructed as ones spiritual foundation and greatest pursuit!

333480690	JasConEd	2013-09-12 03:21:25	What is life/time/relationships if they are not in the name of Christ! Stop wasting what you have undeservingly been given!

333480690	JasConEd	2013-09-25 20:24:10	@coolvinism totally it's simply an evangelistic outreach focused on the music and only implicating elementary truth! No discipling qualities
333480690	JasConEd	2013-09-25 20:25:57	@coolvinism but not to discredit its role. Just no reason to substitute deep truth for catchy choruses!

333480690	JasConEd	2013-12-22 23:22:15	@NicholsKaylee I was hoping so @JasConEd  doesn't exactly have a ring to it
333480690	JasConEd	2013-12-20 03:05:46	@NicholsKaylee me too ;)
333480690	JasConEd	2013-12-23 09:02:56	I just the supporting character
333480690	JasConEd	2013-12-23 09:19:32	I'm here when they need me but I don't have a major role to play.
333480690	JasConEd	2013-12-24 06:54:55	I play that background!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-12-24 06:55:40	I'm the first to know and the first to be forgotten!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-12-25 09:43:56	@helloim_ANDREA I'm in like Peregrin
333480690	JasConEd	2013-12-25 15:51:20	I love driving around town on Christmas it's straight zombie apocalypse out here! I get excited when I see other survivors though!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-12-25 17:31:30	@AmyCleckleyy you just gained so much respect if you were deliberately quoting semi-pro!
333480690	JasConEd	2013-12-25 17:55:31	"Merry Christmas to those who celebrate it!" is the new saying. Is it kinda like "have a blessed day if you believe in Christ that is"?
333480690	JasConEd	2013-12-26 04:49:32	Christmas engagements how cliche I'm going for that Presidents' Day!

333480690	JasConEd	2013-12-28 07:31:59	I feel like I'm only super attractive when I'm hanging out with @MrPoncheezy like my true potential can only be seen through the mike filter
333480690	JasConEd	2013-12-28 07:34:42	Go to the mall alone no one makes eye contact with me. Go to the mall with mike 3 girls randomly compliment me.

333480690	JasConEd	2014-01-21 20:24:19	I could worry about girls and if I got swag all the time! But then my meaning for life would be shallow and mislead!
333480690	JasConEd	2014-01-21 20:26:45	I say to you brothers the only true purpose in Life is Christ! All else will perish and fade! All else is stained with sin and death!
333480690	JasConEd	2014-01-21 20:29:22	It is your choice to live focused on the truth! But remember our actions now will echo throughout generations to come!!
