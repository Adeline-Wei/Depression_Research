33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-18 00:54:23	I don't wanna leave everyone yet 😭
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-18 03:09:17	It's tough when you had a dream of how you hoped things would be and you swore you'd get it right but you didn't..

33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-18 04:15:15	I guess it's natural to want to make people feel shitty about their happiness just because you aren't happy right..?
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-18 04:15:44	“@TorRowell: @mackenzielynaya it may have just been my year. I have faith that both you and @nicolettehawco will get in” love you 😘❤️
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-18 04:16:47	I think being friends with your RA is one if the coolest type of relationships to have.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-18 04:24:26	@BigManColin I think it should be mandatory that we go swimming every weekend now since we have the past few weeks 😊
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-18 04:27:59	You know those moments you have where you think of something totally not socially unacceptable to say so you don't say it.. I always say it.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-18 04:46:51	To all you blue eyed people out there.. There are so many brown eyed people that wish they had your eye colour at some point, so appreciate!

33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-20 05:14:44	He laid his heart and soul right in your hands, and you stole his every dream and you crushed his plans.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-20 05:15:02	@Bszram feel free to retweet me now :)
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-19 13:24:30	Going on without you is killing me everyday.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-19 16:08:37	Spontaneous road trip to windz with the Bell fam 😊
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-20 15:33:09	It makes me sad to think that the majority of foods that are supposed to be healthy for us are probably still killing us.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-20 15:33:40	“: honestly I'd rather hangout by myself than hangout with someone who stares at their phone the whole time were together” @BigManColin ahem

33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-20 22:03:28	I hate that it feels like you're pushing me away.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-20 22:08:32	“@hannah_yall: When I get comfortable with people I start using them as pillows and foot rests” @BigManColin this could not be more accurate
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-20 22:09:52	@TorRowell what? Haha
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-20 16:58:28	@BigManColin next time we hangout we can't touch our phone unless taking selfies togethaaaa hahah deal?

33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-21 05:01:10	Jk I'm psychotic he just didn't text back in like 10 seconds
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-21 05:04:04	#megfollowspree I've been watching your videos forever and you're one of most positive youtubers I know.

33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-21 05:21:05	You confuse me
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-20 20:21:01	I believe in helping people build themselves up again when they're down.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-20 20:44:08	It's sad how I feel like a complete weirdo for having a conscience.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-20 20:45:23	Rule of thumb.. If you don't hear something from the source you probably  shouldn't repeat it.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-21 03:12:51	@BigManColin Love pics 😂😱

33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-18 20:57:43	According to my dad everyone is on bad dope today lol
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-20 03:36:40	We're all fighting some kind of demons, but it isn't so bad when you have people that don't allow you to fight them alone.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-20 03:40:12	Thank you @bunnyloveerr for frequently reaching out to me, it means more than you know. Can't wait to see you in the fall!

33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-20 04:10:56	@BigManColin @brandonprov if you guys really loved me tho you'd listen to it anyways ☺️
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-20 04:27:18	She laid her heart and soul right in your hands, and you stole her every dream and crushed her plans.

33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-21 22:35:32	Fuck this honestly.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-21 22:36:31	I just feel numb to everything right now, scariest feeling.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-21 22:37:59	This all just feels like a big nightmare I want to wake up from.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-21 22:39:10	How did I end up here...
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-21 22:58:02	I just want to turn back time to when it all made sense and I was happy.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-21 23:19:26	Can't take a chance when your chance is taken away from you.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-21 23:22:20	Until you're me in my shoes and have lived my life don't act like you know me.

33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-22 01:28:21	Mix signals are the worst and guys are the worst for giving them.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-22 03:53:49	You give me the kind of hope that no one else can.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2014-07-22 20:40:11	Good looking guys always come into my work when I look like crap and never on the days I actually try lol.

33703795	nicolettehawco	2015-04-28 16:51:24	As scary as it is to potentially lose someone, if you can't be true to yourself for people in your life they shouldn't be there anyways.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2015-05-04 16:36:02	@_oliviahenry hope it gets better 💕

33703795	nicolettehawco	2015-05-07 22:10:55	Laying down on the couch to smack my head off the tv remote was not part of my plans.
33703795	nicolettehawco	2015-05-09 04:42:53	@celbech the only good thing about it for the most part!
33703795	nicolettehawco	2015-05-08 11:40:36	Praying I have the strength to stay awake for my entire drive to Chatham tn cause I don't really have any other choice. 😅
33703795	nicolettehawco	2015-05-09 03:04:32	This playoff game has me thoroughly entertained.
