341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-11 16:30:44	I miss the way we used to talk.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-10 16:30:31	Deep down, I'm still confused about you
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-12 16:30:40	Hardest thing in life, letting go of what you thought was real.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-13 16:30:52	I always say I'm done with you, butI never am.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-13 16:30:52	I always say I'm done with you, but I never am.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-14 16:30:58	I hate when people bring up old shit.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-15 16:30:47	Your smile makes me smile makes me happy.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-16 16:30:34	It all comes down to the last person you think of at night. They have your heart.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-17 16:30:29	I'm sorry I wasn't good enough for you, but trust me.. I tried to be.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-18 16:30:47	At the end of the day, it's always you.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-19 16:30:46	I've liked you since I met you.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-19 18:49:55	yellow may be colour of champions in cricket,!!

341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-20 16:30:49	I'd rather fight with you than love anyone else.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-21 16:30:49	I'll pretend what you said didn't hurt.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-23 17:30:34	I'll never forget the first time I saw you.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-22 17:30:42	Please don't doubt my feelings for you. Because it's the only thing I'm sure of.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-24 17:30:32	I still have feelings for you and it makes me feel stupid.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-25 17:30:46	Not a day goes by without you on my mind.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-26 17:30:41	No one will want for you, what you should want for yourself!
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-27 17:30:41	Always keep your next move on hush mode.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-28 17:30:47	Girl i want you in my life more than needless sites on internet want my email address to send me their stupid news letters everyday.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-29 17:30:45	I need a stable relationship, not because i need it but because i'm tired of saying same dialogues over and over to different girls.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-30 17:30:59	Secret to a happy relationship 
"Make time to each other"
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-01 17:30:40	I don’t care about anyone else, i just want to be good enough for you.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-05-31 17:30:53	No words can explain the way I'm missing you.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-04 17:30:49	I miss our long, meaningful conversations.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-02 17:30:47	The best feeling in the world is knowing that I make you happy.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-03 17:30:36	And right now I just wish you were here.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-05 17:30:37	There may be a million things to smile about, but you're definitely my favorite one.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-06 17:30:32	Every time you smile, I fall more in love with you.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-07 17:30:32	Dear Someone, I'm still waiting for you.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-09 04:24:03	You must begin to think of yourself as becoming the person you want to be.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-08 15:47:06	Love yourself so much that when someone treats you wrong, you recognize it.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-07 17:30:31	Every time you smile, I fall more in love with you.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-08 17:30:49	I need someone who won’t give up on me, no matter how many timesI mess up.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-10 04:34:38	Proud on the Hot Pursuit carried by our army #INDIANARMYROCKS
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-11 03:00:05	Love is something that can only be explained by someone that never felt it.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-14 15:30:33	I get jealous because I'm afraid someone is going to make you happier than I do.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-12 14:30:40	You have no idea how much I like you, how much you make me smile, how much I love talking to you, or how much I wish you were mine.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-13 14:30:32	Don't ever leave the one you love for the one you like, because the one you like will leave you for the one they love.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-15 15:30:40	The best relationships are those where you don't need to be actually with each other but you want to be together.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-16 15:30:46	If you really love someone, do not tell them. Show them.

You are beautiful.

#ThreeWordsSheWantsToHear
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-17 15:30:42	You have no idea how much I like you.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-19 15:30:48	It’s hard to tell your mind to stop loving someone when your heart still does.
341644925	akashdeshmukh01	2015-06-18 15:30:46	I love you a bit more everyday!!
