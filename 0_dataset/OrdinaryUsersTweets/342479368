342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-12 19:26:30	@mackbt13 I'm offended right now, don't talk to me
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-12 23:08:12	It's kinda sad how excited I am about my new pens. #ILoveOfficeSupplies
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-12 23:09:12	Also, I'm pissed off at UCO for holding my enrollment until I get my OSU-OKC transcript. COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-12 23:15:33	@RachaelPresley IM WORKING TONIGHT I CAN'T GO GET MY TRANSCRIPT. DO YOU WANT ME TO KILL YOU.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-12 23:19:34	@RachaelPresley SUCKS TO SUCK.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-12 23:39:01	I hate when I want to text someone but I don't know how to start the conversation. My ability to do things like a normal person is broken.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-13 00:31:38	@RachaelPresley I said like a normal person, Rachael.

342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-19 05:38:25	@foustfist I told you!! 😱 Was it as intense as you thought?!
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-19 05:55:11	@foustfist @davidemmanuel93 I dunno... I hope it's Merle.. Or the Governor. Hate both of em
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-19 06:12:05	@foustfist I seriously can't believe I'm about to watch this. I've lost control of my life. http://t.co/2upQoGtW
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-19 15:21:35	@foustfist ended up watching 2 episodes b/c the first was "to be continued"... I don't see the big deal. It's not HORRIBLE though
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-19 15:26:54	1,000th tweet S/O to @Littleshrimp51 @chmccoy94 and @RachaelPresley for getting me through this year. You guys are awesome~
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-19 18:20:48	"Make friends" they said. "It'll be fun" they said.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-13 05:32:24	Sometimes all I want is a "Goodnight" text, is that too much to ask for? #SingleProbz
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-13 05:34:54	@Davis24Taylor ain't it the life though
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-19 20:48:56	@foustfist did you ever call your future girlfriends? 😏 hahahaha
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-12 02:17:30	@davidemmanuel93 the what?

342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-12 03:16:16	@steffenwsmith but it never actually showed her dying........:
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-13 15:16:21	It's 36 degrees outside, 68 in my house, and I still slept with the fan on.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-12 20:03:05	There are too many people on campus I daydream about running over with my car.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-13 21:42:26	"Well this heart of mine has been hardened like a stone. It might take some time to get back what is gone."
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-13 23:01:59	People are so hypocritical.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-20 15:21:39	Super attractive officer came to ask questions. He left &amp; said "Sorry to bother you all" No trouble at all officer... No trouble at all 😏
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-24 01:27:45	I need to find someone to come over and make pumpkin cookies with me while we watch Anastasia. #IPromiseIm18
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-20 01:59:41	Wittle @harpandclay didn't get much sleep on his bus ride home 😟😘 LOL 😂 http://t.co/UVSws6oo
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-20 13:45:54	Busted window, stolen purse. They have my license, school ID, cash, tuition card (they've already used), bank number, &amp; whatever else. #FML
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-20 13:55:21	@Johnstine12 okay, I'll look into it! Thank you!
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-21 01:36:22	@kenyaksue 😧 what! Where is she?!
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-21 01:47:09	@kenyaksue da hellz, you don't even know?? Lol
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-20 13:47:18	It's too early and I'm already in a horrible mood.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-20 17:11:06	Forgot my father's name &amp; referred to him as "What's his face", this whole 'being 18 and having nothing to do with him' thing is fantastic.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-23 00:39:41	It never really feels like Thanksgiving until Grandma gripes at Grandpa. #FamilyBonding
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-24 19:33:56	@harpandclay that's actually kinda cool!! I wonder if they're warm though, haha.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-24 19:40:00	@harpandclay might actually need a Forever Lazy
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-24 22:27:48	@harpandclay did you know you work today mister?
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-30 04:07:13	@RachaelPresley still the best picture all night
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-30 05:40:58	@MattMelchert "Buy me dinner first"
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-26 16:59:11	“@mackbt13: I've been waiting for this moment all weekend! I finally get to see @ShelbyDawnSims #love #coolkids” 😘
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-26 15:54:31	@RachaelPresley you have some of the most confusing tweets I've ever seen.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-28 02:10:55	My two favorites are still in it to win it! @CassadeePope @TerryMacMusic #TeamBlake
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-27 20:41:35	I've really got to get some of those reindeer antlers and a nose for my car. #TackyTime
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-27 20:50:15	@chelsey_taylor7 I haven't a clue how much they cost or where to find them
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-11-28 17:20:50	@mackbt13 absolutely ADORES our English class.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-01 21:42:13	I always get a kick out of the kids who sit on Santa and start screaming like banshees. It's okay sweetie, he creeps me out too.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-03 16:40:42	Girl in  LAR rocking out to Dude Looks Like a Lady while trying to study. I don't think it's gonna work, but I'm enjoying the mini concert.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-02 06:46:36	@RachaelPresley "EAGLE."
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-05 01:58:56	CANNOT CONTAIN MY EXCITEMENT. #TeamBlake made it through!!
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-05 03:27:31	@bumblebeeso I couldn't agree more! They've been my favorites from the beginning. I'm definitely getting their CD's when possible.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-05 15:34:17	@KelseySissyk94 chin up, Kelsey! You're beautiful, fabulous, hilarious and I love you!  😘
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-05 16:00:03	I blame my cat addiction on everyone who enables me by sending me cat videos/pictures and buying me cat figurines. #AllTheirFault
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-05 19:34:28	Afraid to be home alone right now. Sitting with a knife about to break down in hysterics. WHY DOES ALL THE FREAKY STUFF HAPPEN TO ME. 😭
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-05 20:33:58	@chelsey_taylor7 I think the house got broken into
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-03 19:25:54	Just thought of CB's Christmas party and how if @zachpfeifer &amp; @harpandclay aren't there this year it just won't be the same :( #CBFamily
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-04 03:44:07	@BraydenRouth @chelsey_taylor7 what kind of pickles though, that's the real question ☝
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-04 03:45:57	@chelsey_taylor7 I bet your breath smells fantastic 😵
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-04 04:00:00	Mom: "They act more like buddies than married people." I'm sorry, aren't you supposed to marry your best friend?
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-05 02:16:35	The only bad thing about listening to Taylor Swift is that I can go from happy to sad to bitter in such a short period of time.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-05 14:56:41	S/O to @933JAKEFM for letting me escape all of the overplayed Christmas music
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-09 05:20:44	@RachaelPresley "Hi I'd like to be a to-go order"
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-07 04:18:33	Oh, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Pocahontas, The Aristocats, Fox &amp; the Hound, &amp; Alice in Wonderland are on Netflix?.. So much for finals.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-09 07:23:23	@CasiFaci Happy Birthday, missy!
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-10 16:44:16	@kymrgurl your Lana Del Rey tweets are killing me 😂
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-13 19:40:49	@Davis24Taylor you're such a thug
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-14 16:53:24	@teacherman82 is #HeadDesk the teacher's version of #FacePalm? Because if so, I gotta say that's clever.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-10 02:35:39	I swear it's 20 degrees in my house, even my bath water is lukewarm 😗💨❄
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-10 02:38:55	@RachaelPresley who's "the tempter"

342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-15 19:00:56	The way Olive awkwardly pats Marianne's head in Easy A is my exact reaction to people crying around me.

342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-13 04:15:06	Just got into my 2nd choice for English. @foustfist guess who's in your claaaaaass
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-13 04:20:00	@foustfist well that was just rude.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-13 04:25:41	@foustfist I saw Ian's name but not David's.. Also Hermanski is in there. And possibly Hannah Elliot if it's the same girl from DC. #weird

342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-23 02:00:36	I wonder if I'd get fired if I took a nap right here on the floor at CherryBerry. 4 hours of sleep is NOT enough.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-23 04:45:47	@Davis24Taylor AND IT'S ALWAYS THE BEST ONES THAT YOU WANT TO RETWEET.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-20 22:14:56	Could've sworn I saw @CasiFaci and @chelsey_taylor7 on my way home 😐❓
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-23 22:49:51	The most awkward part about holiday parties is when you're the only single one in the house. 🙋
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-24 07:01:27	@Davis24Taylor I love a good prono
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-24 07:45:30	Playing the "How many hours of sleep can I get if I finish this next episode" game right now. Who needs sleep anyway?
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-24 09:28:13	@steffenwsmith @davis24taylor I just was poking fun because he said prono instead of porno LOL ☺
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-24 20:44:36	Weirdest thing mom said lately: I was "easy to shop for this year". Unless she bought a cat, I'm confused. I never know what I want..
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-24 18:37:42	Working until 4 come see me 😁🍦

342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-26 06:25:29	@MattMelchert Family and friends. The same as a religious person would, I imagine.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-31 19:49:23	2011 and 2012 haven't been the greatest- hoping 2013 brings some change!
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-28 05:32:29	@harpandclay no problem sweet-cheeks! That's the one that made me laugh!! Lol
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-31 04:19:36	I'm finding the fact that my mother thought Hakuna Matata was "a kunimatada" much funnier than I should. #GoodTry #NotQuite
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2012-12-29 03:58:01	@TheRMcCord Adopt me?
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2013-01-02 06:17:02	I don't know what scares me more... How much I creep on people or how good I actually am at it. 💁
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2013-01-02 23:38:43	Found out my weakness today: seeing my cat in pain. Already cried two times today and it's only 5:30. 😟

342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2013-01-14 02:12:37	Jennifer Lawrence, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Kristen Wiig kill me. Too much comedic fabulousness going on on the #GoldenGlobes

342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2013-01-14 21:50:30	Today was my first time in 3 of the 5 buildings I went to for class. I feel like a lost puppy.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2013-01-08 01:40:45	Mom made potato soup, my hair is super soft and I smell fantastic. I think that qualifies tonight as a good night. #LittleThings

342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2013-01-17 19:59:10	Woman on TV talking about how she "let herself go" b/c she doesn't cut her hair every 6-8 weeks. Meanwhile it's been over a year for me.
342479368	ShelbyDawnSims	2013-01-18 04:34:09	Does anyone know anything about #Chegg? Would it be a good idea for me to order a book from there? And how long does it take to ship? #HELP
