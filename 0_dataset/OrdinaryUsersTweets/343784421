343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-04-26 02:30:37	I wish there was a way to delete people out of your life and all the memories that you have with them, that way your could forget them..
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-04-25 00:53:52	I feel like weeks just keep getting longer  and longer the closer to summer we get..
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-04-25 01:09:39	And to think how close we used to be..😔
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-04-25 15:12:45	Tryout day and I'm so nervous. Prayers appreciated!

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-04-27 00:20:14	And still absolutely nothing from you.
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-04-27 00:59:31	I'm sensitive, I over think every little thing, and I care way too much..

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-07 02:08:10	I don't think you realize how much you truly hurt me. But what doesn't kill you makes you stronger I guess.
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-07 02:13:20	Seriously?! Please put on your big girl panties and move on with life. You're in high school.

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-07 23:42:23	Explain to me how you say I really like you but want to wait till after prom to pick "us" up and I haven't heard from you since. Explain...
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-06 19:44:16	One month from tomorrow is the last day of school!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌 #hellooooosummer
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-08 19:55:19	Great day! Hahahaha oh wait those don't exist anymore.😒
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-08 21:01:50	I know my heart will never be the same, but I'm telling myself I'll be okay. Even on my weakest days, I get a little bit stronger.💜💙
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-10 15:08:33	Can I just get out of this place?!
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-08 23:32:41	I wish I could just skip the rest of the school year..
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-09 00:00:28	I'm so ready for Friday night football!
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-07 22:49:26	I love my cheer girls and I have no clue what I would do without them! Im so ready to get this season fully going!💙💚💜

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-07 23:09:57	My moms cooking&gt;&gt;&gt; #yummy 😍😍
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-08 02:03:59	It's seriously such a challenge for me to get myself out of the bed for school. I don't know if I can make it another month.
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-11 03:04:11	@Jatana_Russell Oh my gosh I just got this! It's not fun! Text me if you need anything hahaha let me know how it goes! Haha
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-11 03:06:17	@Jatana_Russell mine cried like every two and a half hours. Sleep when it sleeps though it helps. But if you can't take it then kill it haha
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-11 03:09:02	@Jatana_Russell with mine it would wake up and cry and I had to do everything and it would go back to sleep. It may stop for like 5 minutes
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-11 03:09:20	@Jatana_Russell but then you have to do everything for it to stop completely
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-11 03:10:42	@Jatana_Russell if you can hear it breathe then it's asleep
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-11 03:13:06	@Jatana_Russell hahaha the first night is the hardest. But you sorta get used to the schedule and it's not as bad Waking up at night is hard
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-16 02:01:38	Honestly can't believe I'm almost half way done with high school. I remember the 1st day of freshman year like it was yesterday. #timeflies
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-13 23:54:56	Falling for you scares me more than anything because I'm afraid of being hurt.. but I do it anyway
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-16 16:56:06	This teacher is freaking physco!!! 🔫🔫🔫

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-19 19:40:10	Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend? And if you do well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand if you want to #lovegeorgestrait
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-19 22:10:17	@Just_Blondee about time! Hahahaha

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-19 22:17:52	@Just_Blondee I know. I'm pretty sure it's the worst thing I have to do. It takes forever
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-20 01:46:03	Just wanna go fishing..🐡
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-20 01:48:37	@HannahNiicole13 haha I knew you'd say something like that! ... The fish is always "busy" to make time for anyone else.
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-20 02:19:16	3 weeks left of school🙌🙏🙌🙏
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-20 02:21:08	@HannahNiicole13 I'm in bed actually. Just on my phone..

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-22 00:07:35	I've said all I can say. I told you exactly how I feel and so now it's up to you!
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-22 00:28:22	Can it just be Friday so I can be at the beach?!
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-22 03:07:11	I hate this.
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-22 03:32:35	When I want to sleep, I can't.
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-20 19:40:10	I get so impatient when I'm behind a bus.. #cantstandthem 😡

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-18 21:27:23	The mall just said if you're under 18 and are do not have an adult 21 or older walking with you that you have to leave at 6 o'clock..  #what
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-22 21:55:53	You, my friend, need to learn what the word respect means and try it out sometime. No wonder you can't keep a girl!
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-22 23:27:27	@NIHSbaseball_3 we cute😉
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-18 21:38:28	The mall cops are seriously kicking people out of the mall and escorting them to their cars if they are not 18..
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-18 22:24:56	“@namesbailey: After not talking to him all day, and seeing his name pop up on your phone is the best feeling ever!!”

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-20 23:38:56	I just wish I could understand your way of thinking.

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-21 00:53:47	Atleast I know not all guys are like you. Some actually know how to treat a girl😊
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-05-21 01:21:43	I care too much. Maybe if I wouldn't care about anyone but myself I wouldn't get hurt.. just maybe.

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-02 02:49:22	Deactivating my twitter for a little while.. #byetwitterworld
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-02 23:04:44	I'm so bored right now that I considered starting my summer reading book but then I remembered I hate reading.. Lol
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-02 23:42:04	3 weeks from right now the first football game will be underway!!! 🏈🎀
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-03 03:39:31	@jessb_214 I'm thinking the same thing.. Haha
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-01 03:19:04	I have such a good feeling about this season! We've had enough losing seasons and it's time to show everyone up and prove them wrong!
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-07-31 01:17:18	Me, Hannah, and Rachel complaining about how sore we are and how we can't move right now and feeling sorry for ourselves. 😂😂
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-01 17:22:06	If he misses you, he'll call. If he cares, he'll show it. If not, he can't be worth your time because you're obviously not worth his.
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-07-31 19:57:16	"People will rate you, shake you, break you, and hate you but how strong you stand is what makes you!"
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-07-31 16:06:09	Judgmental people please get on with your life and quit worrying about what I do or don't do. You're NOT perfect so stop acting like you are
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-01 00:49:45	Long hot bath to relax my muscles&gt;&gt;&gt;

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-01 23:10:08	My mom loves my friends more than she loves me..💔
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-01 23:16:01	You made your choice and it wasn't me, so if one day you try to come back and the choice is mine, it won't be you. #SorryNotSorry
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-01 11:20:03	It's too early...😫

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-02 21:48:59	Reactivated my twitter... I couldn't last
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-02 22:08:09	Sometimes the person you want most is the person you're best without.
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-02 21:56:16	@HannahNiicole13 just gonna block some people now I guess
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-03 01:58:45	Life's a long and winding ride, better have the right one by your side. And happiness don't drag its feet, time moves faster than you think💗
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-03 02:08:07	I really miss talking to you..

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-03 21:05:52	It's a smile, it's a kiss, it's a sip of wine, it's summertime.☺💋🍷
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-04 01:28:04	I feel like I'm constantly eating. I think I have a problem.
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-04 20:53:21	I want fall. When it's football season, when I can wear hoodies, and when it perfect weather to cuddle next to a bonfire.
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-04 20:54:50	It's* #pt

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-05 16:12:04	It can't be possible that we only have 3 weeks left of summer..
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-06 03:23:06	Confused more than ever..
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-06 11:37:51	Way too tired..
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-07 02:19:35	Not too difficult, right?😉 http://t.co/HOaNUUZNtw
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-07 02:48:26	The fact that I actually get to sleep in tomorrow&gt;&gt;&gt;

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-08 01:31:43	If you say cheer is not a sport but yet you're a benchwarmer for the sport you play... You have no room to talk. #sorry
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-10 17:44:37	Nap time!!!! Getting up at 5 this morning was not my cup of tea, but had so much fun with all the peewee cheerleaders 🎀☺

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-26 03:21:58	The first day of classes are SO awkward because you go in there and it's so quiet and nobody talks to nobody..
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-24 02:43:58	Awkward.

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-24 17:16:57	I seriously can't believe summer is basically over. I feel like we just got out of school like yesterday..
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-24 17:36:01	@Top_Flight7 haha okay I will!

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-25 21:05:20	Everyone and their mother are in Staples right now..
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-25 22:35:00	It's gonna be so hard going from getting up at 12 everyday to getting up at 6 tomorrow..
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-26 15:11:03	I miss @tutterrow he's not here to walk me to class:(
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-26 02:01:26	No matter how bad I don't want school to start back it's gonna happen so I might as well just go with the flow and enjoy it.
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-26 02:09:55	Hard to believe that 2 years ago I was scared to death the first day of my freshman year and tomorrow I'll walk in as an upperclassman
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-08-26 02:12:23	@Emilinehobbs oh girl I know, and wanting to go back to middle school😂😂

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-10-02 01:02:35	Can I just go back to elementary school when all we worried about was who had the 64 pack of crayons with the pencil sharpener?!
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-10-02 01:07:24	Focusing on my relationship with God and getting where I need to be with Him. Then maybe everything else will fall into place.

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-10-02 02:27:21	@katlinjaane I could go on and on about how immature people are. Like I seriously think my 10 yr old sister is more mature than some people
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-10-02 02:32:22	@katlinjaane seriously. &amp; everyone wants to talk about the "immature freshman" when half the the time they're just as bad Haha I'm on a rant

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-10-02 13:43:18	One of the doctors here at Brenners was just telling me stories about Timmy and it made me tear up. They still remember that sweet boy💙
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-10-02 13:49:21	I told a nurse at Brenner's why I was wearing my "Carolina blue" in Wake Forest territory and she had heard about Dalton! And she's praying💙

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-10-02 20:43:44	I have such a heavy heavy heart.
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-10-02 21:21:17	Hearing "the bus is from Front Street Baptist Church" seriously breaks my heart..
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-10-02 21:29:05	What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? Roman 8:31

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-10-03 00:52:38	This is going to be a long journey for our church. Many GREAT, long time members are either critical or yet to be found. So heartbreaking
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-10-03 01:21:36	I can't explain the hurt I'm feeling. I loved these people with EVERYTHING in me!!!
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-10-03 02:08:06	Through this tragedy, I have to believe that God will/is using our churches motto: Impacting the nations for Christ💜 http://t.co/nV9AblzIUl

343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-10-02 22:19:39	People are here that don't even go here. Community support is the best. It's a full house
343784421	daniellemyers14	2013-10-03 01:38:35	The amount of support that has been shown by our county and from states all around the Nation shows me right there I serve an awesome God!!
