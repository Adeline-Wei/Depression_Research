35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-04 22:57:33	Just realised that instead of turning my electric blanket off last night, I set it to a lower setting. It's been on ever since 😳 #uhoh

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-05 13:11:11	Oh my god, shut up please
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-05 13:12:09	There's nothing more annoying than people constantly making noise while you're trying to concentrate on something
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-05 13:43:20	My damn tongue is killing me 😭😫
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-05 14:24:23	@s0metw4t_ @N0_Just_N0 23rd even? 😋 But yes. A million times yes. It will be well needed

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-06 23:00:45	Beginning to realise that I may not be cut out for college. Might be a bit late but sure..

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-06 23:15:51	Have to mind my cousin while attempting to study for exams. The lc mocks all over again. Although, I was quite happy for those weeks

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-06 10:21:47	Had 2 of the most horrible dreams ever last night. Woke up with years streaming down my face.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-06 19:35:18	If I was tanned, these trousers would look so much better
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-07 10:29:50	I am having the strangest dreams lately and it's getting harder to distinguish them from real life situations.

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-20 10:05:38	Been off twitter for 2 weeks and I have nothing to tweet about. I feel strange..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-20 10:09:05	I couldve spent the weekend with friends but instead I decided to be good &amp; study stuff that left my brain the second I sat in the exam hall
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-20 10:11:16	(Not so) secretly happy that I can now be one of those annoying people who goes on about being finished while others still have exams 😈

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-21 16:24:17	@Clio_ws I know! Was off twitter during exams and I've been quite the hermit lately. Even my family was unaware of my existence.. :o &lt;3
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-21 16:24:38	I love the zoo. And these 3 😊
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-21 16:24:53	@Clio_ws you coming Wednesday? :)
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-21 16:37:11	It's official, I wanna be a sloth.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-21 16:51:33	@Clio_ws with great difficulty :P I hope so too :L I can't wait to see people though :o
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-21 22:39:32	Attempting to do leaving cert maths when you're this tired is impossible
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-21 22:41:53	I thought spc was getting better after I left but they're losing Mr. Gaffney and Bean Uí. I have one word. Ha. I'm sad but, ha.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-21 22:43:13	@Clio_ws not a clue :/ you were the only one who really got back to me about it. I think it's at 4, or so the bros say :P
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-21 22:56:16	@Farrell03 I hear you're back to work tomorrow so it mustn't be as awful now as it was. Get well soon anyway!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-21 23:09:54	Mooney Cup 😄👍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-24 02:16:19	Mc Donaaaaaalds
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 20:22:43	We are that family that offer religious speakers lifts home. Yes.

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 21:02:10	Graham Norton 👌❤
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 21:16:03	Everyone seems to be watching the Titanic. I find it strange that I'm not.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 21:29:49	Decided to make jelly. Opened it up to find an insect embedded in it. Thanks Chivers, thank you. http://t.co/gFsukELvdz
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 22:05:45	@ScottyMcCreery reading all of these tweets about people going I see you and wishing I was one of them. If I had money, I'd be there ✈
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 22:08:07	Sometimes I love my brothers. Other times, they inspire my inner killer.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 23:04:02	People who follow you and then unfollow you when you follow them back. I do not know you but I will find you and I will unfollow you. #boom
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 23:07:17	July 14th. Can't wait 😄😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 23:25:49	If there's someone that you care about in this world, then the risk lies in not letting them know, while you have the chance.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 23:28:23	Ah feck. People are in the Roost. I wanna be in the Roost. Suffering from withdrawal already :(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 23:31:02	@Clio_ws thinking maybe we should have a regular night out for a few quiet drinks in Brady's or something. I need my fix of you and 🍺 ;)
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 23:31:55	:o I can start reading books again. This will be the highlight of my summer. Wow. That says a lot..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 23:32:47	I'm sorry but I hate how my mam is constantly comparing my life to everyone else's. Not cool.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-22 13:30:41	Where does the day go?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 11:07:54	I love the fact that I don't have to study 😄
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 11:08:08	Woke up singing a song. Put my iPod on shuffle and the first song is that song #creepy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 12:48:58	“@Fascinatingpics: Baby goat conquers human. http://t.co/i9MJWSqrcw” @N0_Just_N0 😵😵😵😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 12:50:08	Wow. My laptop has gone to shit since I gave it to my brothers. My iTunes and iPod are f*cked.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 13:50:59	Was out for a cycle seeing as its such a nice day and all but then, I got lonely. Sad times.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 15:09:57	I dunno boy, I think I may be fallin for you
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 15:11:26	I got bored so I decided to curl my hair. I now look like a bush
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 15:22:48	Tweeting lyrics cause I'm cool. 😏
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 15:28:25	Kinda cool finding out you're distantly related to Joe Sheridan. It might be distant, but it's true. 😜
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-24 17:28:28	There's a stranger in my kitchen.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-24 17:29:19	Well..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-24 17:29:25	Pulling that all-nighter was not our finest idea..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-24 17:43:47	Forgot what the pain of eating gluten full food was like. My stomach has been in utter hell for the last 3 days.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-24 17:44:09	I better be paid for those smokes. I'm not letting this go. I need as much money as I can get now. It's not a joke anymore. #pissed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-24 17:45:44	I know who the stranger is now. Still don't wanna go face them, in my pajamas.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-24 19:13:17	Disappointed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-24 19:14:04	Heard my dad say 'Ah right, okay' 4 times in less than a minute, during a phonecall. Now I know where I got it from
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-24 20:30:42	The extremely irritating moment when you're in the middle of watching a show online and then, half way through, it decides to stop working..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 20:09:20	I hate how people tweet the exact same thing. My timeline has been repetitive all day. Think some I following is in order..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 20:13:43	Finishing the wine myself before it turns to vinegar 😖 it tastes manky and my legs are becoming jelly already. Lightweight in the making
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 20:32:40	I love how every Hart of Dixie episode is named after a country song 😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 20:54:44	If employers read my tweets, they would probably never hire me
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 21:07:57	Everyday, even groundhog day?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 23:28:08	No matter how much you hate someone, there are just some things between ye that should be taken to the grave.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 23:28:15	People who take credit for other people's jokes. No 😑
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-26 23:55:36	I wanna be in the west. That's all. :)
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 00:32:08	Revelling in the fact that my entire family is asleep cause they've work or school tomorrow but i have no reason to need to sleep
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 00:33:40	Who is #oomf? Everyone seems to want to be with them. I wanna meet them
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 22:11:10	Can't wait for the next Madden family wedding. Can finally get slashed with the lot 😝
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 22:16:07	First time listening to iRadio for the first time in what feels like years. 😂😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 22:18:52	You know you were a bad drinker when @N0_Just_N0 has the ability to make a collage of photos of you on the ground. #sorryimnotsorry 😳😥
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 22:21:13	I hate those whole #beforeidieiwantto things. I'm never gonna do those kinda things anyway. Not even gonna dream, sad. Sad, sad, sad.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 22:22:11	@DAlbaFernandez that just reminded me that I was to text someone that I never actually texted :o thank you!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 22:23:14	Who would love Chinese right now? Me, actually..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 22:24:49	@DAlbaFernandez true that! You just saved my friendship :')
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 22:26:06	I'm gonna make it my summer goal to find a bottle of coke with my name on it. How hard can it be to find one with 'Ciara' in Ireland?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 22:31:02	@DAlbaFernandez WHAT? I haven't been able to find any. How? Just, uuugh
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 22:32:03	Nooo! The app just randomly stops working every once in a while and it seriously kills me. I always miss the good bits of 'there I said it'
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 22:32:54	@DAlbaFernandez ill be there tomorrow ma bruda!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 22:55:01	@N0_Just_N0 😦 you should! Please? 😊 It would be well appreciated
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 22:56:26	There have been so many rumours of people's deaths on twitter that it's so hard to tell when they're actually genuine.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 22:59:22	@ConThePrawn you could have at least spelt her second name right to satisfy her wandering spirit Conor. She will haunt you forever now..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 23:03:43	@N0_Just_N0 both, I'm sure. You'll have my appreciation anyway. I don't like to steal this feeling of specialness from everyone else. 😋
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-24 22:12:18	'If only there was a magic pill that could make you feel better.' I like where you're going with this Zoey 😉
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 17:51:56	Trying to teach my brother science for his test tomorrow. It's like working with Frankenstein.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-27 18:42:08	Dad: Do ya remember the year you went to England, Eamonn?
Eamonn: Yeah! Sure I was with them! 😂😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-28 10:44:49	@ConThePrawn okay, I suppose I can forgive you.. :P uuugh, I'd love to haunt her but she's already haunting me. Ruined integration for me
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-28 10:45:01	@N0_Just_N0 woah! Really? That's really surprising. When was he ever on the ground? Maybe my memory is worse than I thought 😕😩
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-28 10:45:46	Was getting kinda annoyed that after 4 days my hair still smelled of smoke. I have now come to realise that it's all over my pillow 😫😒😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-28 10:47:26	'Waking up for good morning text &lt;3' hahah no ones text me for 3 days #foreveralone
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-28 11:26:32	@marko93101 :') can always count on you to make my day baby &lt;3 miss you xoxox
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-28 12:44:19	Toes is about me. Just change the genders and the beer to cocktails. 😉🙊👌
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-28 15:31:15	Captains Wednesday 😄 can't wait!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-28 15:31:35	Seeing that someone has read your message but they haven't replied. Not impressed.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-28 15:34:22	People cannot be annoyed at me for not making an effort. I'm the only one whos making one #pissed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-28 15:42:59	I can smell ice ya know! When it's near..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-28 19:21:59	Oh my goodness. Tomorrows Wednesday. Wow. Summers going fast already. Captains! 🍹🍹🍹🍸🍸🍷🍻
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-29 19:42:33	@TeamMileyNY Ireland 🍀🍀 #4DaysWeCantStop 😃 so excited 😍💜
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-29 19:43:02	Whenever someone says 'I love Ted', I automatically think Father. Sorry bear
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-29 19:46:52	@RyanD14 thank you. And so, the Father Ted Appreciation Group begins
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 12:02:22	My ponytail is enchanting today 😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 12:04:32	People need to organise things better #somessy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 12:05:52	When people take advantage of people's generosity 😒
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 12:06:33	Slept for 10 hours last night. Why am I still sleepy?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 13:09:25	I wanna go back to Florida 😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 13:16:30	Now is a good time #Bulmers #yes
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 13:19:46	I wanna have a proper picnic somewhere. Preferably in Achill. On or by the beach. Or on top of the Minaun cliffs 😵 #perfection
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 13:40:50	People who wear 'Kiss me, I'm Irish' t-shirts even though they're not Irish. Why?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 13:45:04	I love how American the No No ad is
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 01:00:29	'Will we try..' Why bother asking? If I say no, you get pissed off anyway so..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 01:00:37	Randoms are my life.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 01:00:56	Ah! New twitter #confused
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 01:01:45	Ran into one of the most amazing people ever tonight. Haven't seen the girl in yeeeears. Absolutely love her!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 01:21:26	Painting Nana' and Gaga's at the weekend. Gonna be weird but I'm excited 😊
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 01:23:35	Stood outside for 10 mins waiting for my dog to do her business but no. She'd rather stand and stare at something that (I hope) isn't there
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 01:23:51	Freaked me out to no end
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 01:24:30	Triple caramel? What!? Life. Made.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 01:25:20	In the mood for food but there's nothing I can eat #sadtimes
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 14:50:01	Still sick. This is not right.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-25 17:20:17	Brushing my hair and all I could get was the whiff of hairspray and smoke 😖😖 #ew
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 12:02:40	Hash(tag) mixed with synthetic drugs..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 12:03:35	People having weird dreams all round lately, including myself. Something in the water?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 12:49:00	My brother has gone missing. I'm all alone.. Anyone wanna come keep me company?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 13:16:21	I wanna go on holiday
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 13:16:46	Or even just to the beach
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 14:11:13	Us Irish are so hard to please. We complain that there's no sun and then when there is, we complain that it's too hot to bear. Blah
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 14:14:07	Would love to have a barbecue 🍻🍹🍹🍔👫👬👭👯
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 14:24:19	There's a fierce wind out there, lads! It'd tip the cows over, it's that bad
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 14:25:44	Gosh. I'm bored.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 19:00:18	Mam is sick. This entire house is going to fall apart.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 19:13:50	And so, the stay in Thursdays begin
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 19:17:00	Literally cannot wait to be on the other side of the country. Achill, I miss you http://t.co/IaRV4wCf34
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 11:19:40	Brothers picking fights an t-am ar fad, just to piss me off 😡😫
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 11:25:33	I've had the time of my life, and I owe it all to you 💜💚
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 11:48:26	Last day of May 😧
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 11:49:35	I just don't know.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 11:52:27	Anyone wanna kidnap me? Sick of being at home with my brothers already.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 11:58:47	Twitter is for tweeting what you want, when you want. People cannot complain that I tweet too much. I like to tweet #sorryimnotsorry #boom
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 11:59:32	If you don't like my tweeting, just unfollow me. Please?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 12:00:12	Sorry, in a bad mood and took to twitter
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 12:08:57	@DAlbaFernandez yeah. The result of my seriously annoying brothers being home and finished for the summer -_- sorry. I'll try &amp; cheer up
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 20:59:32	I, I just, I.. Em
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 21:01:44	The sky had been so pretty the last few evenings
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 21:01:57	Red sky at night and all that 😉
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 21:12:47	Cindy's all sad :( what up Cindy?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 21:27:52	@paul_gilmartin welcome back. Now go away
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 15:35:01	Who wants to be my favourite person EVER and fund a weekend in the west for me this weekend? :D
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 21:39:33	@s0metw4t_ already in the process deary
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 21:51:44	Morgan Freeman is amazing
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 23:14:58	@marko93101 naaw! Ain't you cute

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 23:16:10	Might have something to do for the weekend :o won't be lonely no more
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 23:19:10	@marko93101 took my thoughts and put them into words. Cute and talented. Maria's a lucky girl :')
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 23:19:48	I'm one of those rare people who doesn't like Adele's music
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 23:22:29	My mams been asleep since 4. Is it weird to say I'm proud of her?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 23:23:39	@marko93101 hmm, seems like a very wise decision. Who needs science anyway? You go Sparky! Follow your dream! We support you #alltheway

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-30 23:34:55	When the flash comes on, my facial parts decide to be selectively existent #ghostly http://t.co/IR0qsLC13V
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 21:02:12	Hey Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 21:14:03	Want to get my phone but it's in my room. And I'm in the kitchen. Ugh, effort.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 21:26:18	@DAlbaFernandez *repeat that 3 times more* I'm gonna pop some tags, only got 20 dollar in my pockeeet. I'm, I'm huntin! Lookin for a come up

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 21:52:51	@DAlbaFernandez shnap! I spent so much of my time learning that song. I still know it all :') love that song
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 21:56:55	@DAlbaFernandez I like it!! It's a plan
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 22:24:27	Going to do something, getting distracted and forgetting what it was you were going to do in the first place #mylife
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-05-31 23:02:38	Happy 1st of June. Just think, on the 30th of June, we'll be half way through 2013. Let that sink in for a sec
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-02 14:15:56	Really wanna go out tonight but there's no one to go out with 😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-02 14:16:00	To say I'm raging that I'm not going to Sligo today would be an understatement 😢 I'm actually devastated. I need to get down there soon!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-02 14:16:56	Having could quite possibly be the most exciting weekend of my summer. Painted a house yesterday, giving Cindy a bath today, bloom tomorrow
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-02 14:17:21	That seems rather sad.. Ah sure
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-02 15:46:29	Completed my summer mission and found a coke bottle with my name on it. Thank you Maynooth! I can always count on you :') #boom
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-02 16:28:35	Brought Cindy for a walk, after her bath, and I foolishly wore my wellies. My feet are literally burning right now 😫😓
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-02 20:09:10	I miss @N0_Just_N0 and @s0metw4t_ 😢
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-02 20:15:49	@Stephen_Fay @N0_Just_N0 @s0metw4t_ you're just jealous
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-02 20:20:53	@Stephen_Fay of the fact that you weren't included in my tweet. You can admit it. It's okay. Acceptance is the first step ya know
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-02 20:21:25	I forgot how much I love Michael Collins
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-02 21:58:25	The new club orange bottles are weird.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-02 23:11:18	I still smell like dog shampoo
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-03 17:40:40	The last thing I expected from bloom was to get really nice free drink and really sunburnt. Good day
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-03 18:02:57	If your child looks like Dora and you don't want people taking photos of them, don't bring them out in public. http://t.co/iiDGg3GL1W
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-03 18:04:57	'Would ya kill me dad?' 'No... I couldn't afford a coffin' #thanksdad 😂😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-03 18:29:37	@DAlbaFernandez I'm admiring her! Is that a crime?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-03 19:12:04	Finally had tea for the very first time in 2 years. It tasted so unbelievably good! Head and stomach are paying for it now though 😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-03 19:28:57	@maria12048 good night? :P
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-03 19:30:00	Sunburn. It's actually quite sore #ouch
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-03 19:31:43	Shawn: Put a baby in me 😂😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-03 19:32:23	Psych 🍍❤
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-03 19:35:24	@maria12048 aw I'm absolutely raging I missed it :( no, unfortunately not. I was hoping to but no one was going out :/ hopefully soon though
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-03 21:51:13	Determined to do the mini marathon next year.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-03 22:21:37	Had something of a farmers tan. My bracelets have left a white mark between my hand and the rest of my arm
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-05 10:10:25	Following the sounds of a song you love and finding yourself in the retirement tent #bloom thank you for the hint about my taste in music
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-03 01:43:38	I never really read but when I do, I find it hard to stop. Just finished a book in 3 days. Achievement for me.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-05 17:28:43	When something is so red, it's purple. You'd get what I'm saying if you could see my arm right now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-05 17:46:17	What would you do if you weren't afraid?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-05 19:35:11	Two words. Ouch and f*ck.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 16:50:49	@ThisisiRadio posted this on Facebook and it has literally made my day. Thank you iRadio! 😍 http://t.co/lxZYHxb9cb
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 22:40:09	Ya know how people talk about sexual tension between the exam attendants and examiners. I won't deny that I had some with my examiner
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 22:41:10	He was my actual examiner during my leaving too. He even hugged me when he saw me for the first time in a year #truelove
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 23:20:21	@Clio_ws aw :( to be honest, I wouldn't have minded being alone with my one. He was so sweet :') AND from Sligo ;) &lt;3 I miss him. :(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 23:48:36	@Clio_ws :o no way! When? Cause I might be going this weekend :D
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-04 12:20:10	This time last year I was doing the very same thing I'm doing now, only I had an exam the following day. Feels better this year though
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-04 13:21:55	I think I'm getting a burn on top of a burn
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-04 13:22:44	I think my dogs cursing her long fur now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-04 14:45:17	It's weather like this that makes me glad I'm unemployed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-04 19:34:09	I told my friends I couldn't afford to go away for a week to Galway. So instead they ask me would I go to Turkey with them. Really? 😒
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-04 23:14:16	Kangaroos are underrated. They're so unbelievably cute
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-04 23:14:30	Sometimes videos are better than photos
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-04 23:14:47	Found our camera with videos from our holidays last year. They're so nice to watch but they're making me wanna go back even more 😟 #nextyear
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-04 23:16:43	@maria12048 would love to! ASAP :D :P aw they were okay. Not too pleased with them but we'll see at the end of June what the damage is
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-04 23:17:13	@maria12048 so sorry maria. I was sure that tweet had sent yesterday but I just noticed it hadn't :/
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-05 00:55:20	Ya know those days where you just really miss someone and everything reminds you of them. Yeah, having one of those days. 😢😞
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-05 00:56:01	Just look around the room. So much of her remains. 🎶❤😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-03 08:53:12	@s0metw4t_ of course not.. 😏
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-03 08:54:00	Bloom 🌷🌸🌹🌺🌼
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-04 21:45:30	Despite wearing sun cream on my face today, I think I got burnt. Great. Now it'll be even redder than usual.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-08 21:27:46	@NicholasSparks A Bend In The Road :) such a beautiful story and the twist is just amazing!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-08 21:27:58	I wish I was rich.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-08 21:34:14	I really wish I had the money to go out tonight :( I miss Maynooth
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 01:55:41	I wanna go to Achill Island ASAP. That is all.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 00:13:11	Wish I could join the ghost thingy in his little disco on snap chat as my stuff loads #jealous
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 00:14:33	I wanna follow more people from America. Any Americans want a follower?  😉😄
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 00:18:42	There are so many photos of Achill on Instagram. They're so pretty but it's making me so sad that I'm not there 😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 00:19:02	For once, a man didn't recognize because I was wearing glasses. Felt good.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 00:20:33	I need to stop following people from Achill.. Who am I kiddin? Naaah 😉
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 00:23:13	Seeing a couple and thinking 'you are literally too perfect for words'
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 00:24:42	@maria12048 I wish I could but I'm busy that weekend :( I didn't realise at the time. Next year, hopefully :)
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 00:28:37	She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. I put my Walkman on said 'I might as well kick it!'
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 00:36:43	We don't all have jobs, or money or parents who can afford to give us some when we want it. Please understand when I say I can't afford it
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 00:37:47	This trip to the beach better be worth all this money #soexpensive
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 00:38:50	I love the start of Imma Bee 🐝
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 00:45:43	How do chiropodists do their jobs? I just, I can't.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 00:46:00	I hate feet. I can't even put into words just how much I hate feet. #ew #justdont

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 00:58:05	Hate all those 'Like=Save the whales Ignore=You hate the whales and are going to hell' yes, because a like on fb will save a whale 😒
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 01:07:09	Setting my alarms. 8:00 😂😂 http://t.co/j0l55F1vvF
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 01:07:40	@DAlbaFernandez what if I didn't wanna save the whales? Hmmm making ya think
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 01:09:25	@marko93101 Ah now, we dont want to hear things like that around here Sparky. Be a good boy now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 01:13:39	Can't wait til Tuesday 😁 Get to see Mick again 😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 01:48:23	Does anyone else feel something of a loss when they finish reading a book that they really got into?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 01:52:40	Kinda disappointed with that ending though
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 01:23:27	@paul_gilmartin GO AWAY AND GO TO SLEEP! Don't make me come in there #justdont
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 01:24:42	@marko93101 I'm sorry, I should never have asked you to change who you are :( forgive me? xo

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 01:36:19	@paul_gilmartin probably one of the best pees I've ever had #nightbro
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 14:51:14	Sharing a punnet of grapes with my dog as we laze in the sun #asyado
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 08:08:30	Was up at 8 today. Can't remember the last time I was up that early.. I've gotten so lazy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 16:20:24	Really tempted to do the Achill Half Marathon this year ☺
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 16:51:36	Photobombing at its best http://t.co/pdKGQ46Qdo
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 17:39:50	@s0metw4t_ @N0_Just_N0 I was listening to that last night and that dance was the only thing I could think of 😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 21:37:05	Oh the things I would do if I had money
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 21:58:42	I think my candy crush addiction has seized
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 22:09:54	I really would rather not leave the house tomorrow #hermit
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 23:22:38	Going back to my music obsessions of the years 2008-2011. #Nowplaying Miley Cyrus. Yeah. Kinda loving it. JoBros next.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 23:23:38	Anyone wanna do the toning class thing with me in St. Peter's next year? 😁
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-06 23:35:43	@Clio_ws hopefully! I wanna see you again too :o soon. Very soon. ;)
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 15:12:50	@N0_Just_N0 is it bad in Athlone? 😧
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 15:14:57	Maybe this break in the weather will be good. The sun won't be shinning so i wont feel compelled to go outside. No more burning 😁
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 15:17:07	@N0_Just_N0 naw 😞 it's windy here but still sunny and warm.. We're talking about weather. We're old now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 15:24:37	I know it's annoying when guys leave the toilet seat up but it's more worrying when you see a girl has done it.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 15:37:54	People who have high expectations are often disappointed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 16:01:28	Mam thinks Im suffering from a bit of sunstroke. It's not so fun
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 16:06:55	I haven't had a bath since I was a very young child. I wanna have one now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 16:09:23	It's the last day of holidays all over again. Got burnt with a triangular shape on my thighs.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 19:30:11	5 hours of beach with the catch of 4 hours travelling. If I never see a bus again, I'll be happy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-09 19:59:49	I put on sun cream more than anyone else and I still manage to be the only one to get severely burned #inpain
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 13:50:57	It's raining in Galway and probably elsewhere in Ireland but its still nice here. Poor them
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-11 21:10:55	House of Prayer on TV3 at the moment. Kinda wish my dad would watch it and get the picture
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-11 21:18:43	I told Mick I missed the rain and I was glad it was back. His only response was 'Ah, you must be a farmer!' 😂😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 21:11:18	@Clio_ws you're going to Galway! I'm so utterly jealous. Ive never been and really wanna go. We're gonna be on opposite sides if the Isle :(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 21:13:21	Bored. Utterly bored.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 21:14:07	@Clio_ws it's very mutual :( you free next week? I'd LOVE to see you
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 21:15:37	@Clio_ws I know :( omg please? Can we?? Ah well, like I always say, any time in the west is always to be valued ;) &lt;3
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-13 21:42:33	In tears of laughter listening to iRadio at the moment 😂 am I too easily amused?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-13 22:20:25	@HateChrisGreene I'm sorry, Chris. Last thing I wanted to do was offend you. You know I always find you very entertaining. Forgive me? :(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-13 22:22:15	Sometimes you just gotta love science. http://t.co/5GWAY1th1l
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-13 22:32:21	@jankruszynski thank you? :P
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-13 22:39:25	@DAlbaFernandez don't confuse me even more than I am.. It won't end well :/
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 21:23:04	@Clio_ws yay! I'll try organise something :) I've sunstroke so can't do it this week :( I know. Country living can be a curse and a blessing
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 21:23:48	@Clio_ws YES :o thank you! Nobody ever gets me on that :') we definitely should though ;) ah, I'm so excited :D
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 22:06:01	😧 @N0_Just_N0 @s0metw4t_ they're playing Whole Again on @ThisisiRadio right now 😢😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 22:06:40	@Clio_ws cooool! I'll text ya at some stage with suggestions :D have fun tomorrow :)
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 22:28:03	My mam knows I don't like TCD and yet she's forcing me to apply there 😑 and this hasn't been the first time.. Not impressed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 22:55:01	I was told by a friend that your chances of getting melanoma are increased if you're very pale. Thanks. I'm utterly f*cked
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 23:19:23	Sleep is proving very difficult to achieve right now.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-10 23:20:16	Think I might buy Kenny Rogers tickets for my dad for Father's Day. Hoping he'll offer to give me one. #guiltypleasure
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-11 12:39:20	I hate cars with loud exhausts. Now the ugly sharks exhaust is broken and extremely loud 😑
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-11 13:04:26	'Some gender confused wolf tells him she's already married' 😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-11 15:18:20	Can you get high on diesel? The fumes from my dads work clothes have been filling the house all day, and I am not well
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-11 18:30:58	It's people like Mick who make learning to drive worth doing 😍 I think.. I'm in love
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-11 18:52:45	La la la da dee, we like to party 👏
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-13 13:24:02	Neighbours nabbed it in the bag today #intenseshizz
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-13 14:18:27	Despite all the 'horror' stories they're telling on @ThisisiRadio about working in a bar, I still wanna work in one
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-13 14:37:22	I can't listen to Stay by Rihanna without thinking of Vin Diesel 😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-13 15:03:53	How simple the days were when your biggest worry was who was player one on the wii
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-17 15:05:51	This has made my day. I am literally in stitches. http://t.co/4FVI6m0KzK
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-17 21:53:38	I always feel guilty texting people while they're doing exams
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-17 23:13:06	Sarcasm is so hard to portray through social media. Life is so hard. #firstworldproblems
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-18 22:46:39	Goldshlanger always tastes so good and seems like a good idea at the time. It's the days after that make you realise you were wrong. So sick
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-17 17:53:00	Extremely excited for this weekend 🙊
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-16 17:17:48	Almost got on the bus to Galway instead of Maynooth. To be honest, if I wasn't feeling so sick, I probably would have willingly got on it.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-19 09:02:57	Crows are my roosters. But it's a much uglier wake up call
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-17 23:33:16	The aftermath of sunburn is far worse than the sunburn itself. After sun is still my best friend
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-18 21:33:30	I hated Grey's Anatomy for a long time but these last 2 weeks it's been pretty good
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-18 21:48:19	Silence makes me uncomfortable.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-18 22:07:01	Addicted to Chocolate today. It reminds me of college... I miss college :(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-19 20:59:05	I love Flogging Molly too much
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-19 21:01:12	If taken out of context, that last tweet could seriously change people's view of me..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-20 15:01:40	It seems I'm one of the few who have no looked up their results yet.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-20 17:57:00	I laughed at a guy on tv for cutting out so often in a day. And in one driving lesson, I swear I cut out at least 10 times #karma #weirdcar
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-19 11:56:06	My skin was perfect. What happened? 😱😭
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-20 21:32:54	My claddagh ring broke 😫😭
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-19 17:26:32	Miley Cyrus' new music video.. Yeeah. I.. Em.. *cough*
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-19 17:43:53	My brother and I haven't talked in about 2 weeks and I can't even remember why we stopped talking. Oh, sibling rivalry
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-19 18:09:14	People with a fast metabolism make me jealous
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-19 19:27:31	Almost text the Roost asking did they wanna go out this weekend #awkward
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-21 10:20:12	I wish I was Julia Roberts
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-21 18:45:00	Having one of those days where it starts out really well and then it just goes to shit 😞
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-21 16:13:05	I think my mam gets me to do the hoovering cause she knows I'm a perfectionist who'll get into all the nucks and crannies that she wouldn't
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-21 20:29:35	I actually think I'd be better off with no previous work experience at this stage. I'll never get bar experience cause I've only got retail
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-21 20:30:26	I'm a good worker. I swear. And now, I'm desperate! Please, please hire me :'(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-21 20:36:58	I wish I could use twitter to apply for jobs. It would avoid any need for me to leave the house. Which is next to impossible now anyway
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-21 21:05:06	@DAlbaFernandez yes. Yes they are. Mad feckers
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-21 21:11:03	@DAlbaFernandez whatcha talking about willis! I have neighbours!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-21 21:11:42	Watching animals pretending to be shot. This has made my day 😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-21 21:20:52	@DAlbaFernandez I'm sorry. I never have people over. It's too awkward for peeps to get here :( and I'm a hermit..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-22 12:57:14	It's only when I'm about half way through a book that I actually start to become interested in it. Can't put this one down now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-22 13:45:13	Oh, my car smells like chocolate
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-22 15:06:08	I'm such a daydreamer
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-22 15:40:44	You know when you're hungry but you know if you eat, you'll be sick 😣
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-23 10:10:13	When you've so much to do so you just lie on the bed waiting for the fairies to do it all for you..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-23 12:40:59	Sligo bound 😄👏
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-23 12:41:50	There are so many old men on this train 😱😍 #heaven
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-23 12:55:59	Resisting the urge to shake my body like a belly dancer
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-23 13:27:04	I love Sundays when my timeline is just filled with updates on #gaa matches ☺
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-23 13:40:29	The further into the west I get, the worse the weather seems to be getting. Poor west :(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-26 10:41:56	I hate being the awkward one #almostthuglife #coeliaclife
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-26 10:47:13	Had the best weekend ☺ thank you @AoifeGilmartin @niamhgil and everybody else :P
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-26 10:48:21	Mam says I've developed a bit of a Sligo accent in the few days I was there. I think she's just forgotten what I sound like #crazylady
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-26 15:54:27	These next 3 weeks better fly. And then, August
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-26 23:01:05	I've become somewhat depressed since I got home today. I really, really wanna live in the west. Simple as. Pretty please?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-25 15:00:26	Can I just live here? 😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-28 12:15:43	Having a very productive morning. This is very unlike me
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-28 14:07:49	'You were a mistake' 'He was not a mistake! He was an accident!' 😂 Can't believe I'm only seeing Moone Boy now #brilliant
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-28 20:15:52	Times like this make me hate living so far from everything
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-28 20:26:35	Mood most foul #sweeerve
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-29 15:04:55	Wish I'd someone coming out tonight. Gonna be awkward and lonely
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-28 23:22:52	Total downward spiral
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-28 23:23:46	My mam becomes a demon when she does a full house clean. And who always bears the brunt of her anger? Moi. #feelingshit I need a hug 😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-29 17:46:32	Serious stomach pains and awful headache but sure, be grand!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-28 23:46:24	I wish I had someone that I could call up or go see at any time and just talk. 😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-28 23:57:16	One of the rare moments when I actually wish I could go back to a few years ago. I wanna rekindle a friendship that meant so much to me then
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-29 00:12:56	Jean Butler is stunning!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-29 00:21:53	@paul_gilmartin seriously fo Paul.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-29 19:56:16	Found my little guardian angel :) all is good again
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-29 20:19:00	Dad asked me did I wanna go to Maynooth. I actually got really excited cause I thought he meant out. But he just meant to shop
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-29 20:19:18	I miss Maynooth far too much 😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-29 12:16:09	We Can't Stop comes on the radio, I turn it up and dad and I have a little rave in the kitchen
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-29 12:18:29	We're normal. I swear..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 12:39:49	My dear God.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 12:40:49	Hard to believe that this time last week, I was on my way to Sligo. I wanna go back 😩😄
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 13:10:09	This Meath match was like a really good tennis game there for a while. Just going from side to side with no score #WimbledonFever
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 14:03:37	I should have gotten drunk at least twice a week this summer. That way, I wouldn't have developed this intolerance #tisawful #embarrassed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 14:55:17	Its a great week for gaa. Tubber bet Curty.  A win for Mayo and Meath all in one day. Now, this would make it. C'mon Kildare! 😄😋👍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 14:55:55	Haha, that should be Curry in the last tweet #awkward
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 14:56:23	What did I do with my contacts last night? I actually have no memory
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 15:12:02	Well I obviously did something, but I don't know what it was
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 15:35:42	My iPods destroyed 😩
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 15:47:39	Being tormented by my brothers.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 16:11:20	London Leitrim game #intense
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-05 12:01:30	@Clio_ws not sure, not feeling too good :( but I'll try and make it #missyoutoo
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-05 12:04:14	The 4th of July, 2013 will always be remembered as the day the next generation of the Gilmartin family was born #woo #socute
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-06 11:50:12	Hoping the next 2 weeks will livin my spirits #excited 😁
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-06 13:39:19	@Clio_ws I'll be going Brady's but not chasers. #cantwaittoseeyou :D
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-07 13:31:22	Sit in and watch Murray and Djokovic or go out and watch the rally? #hmm
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-07 13:47:30	That's actually kinda sad
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-06 14:32:45	Decided to paint my nails red, out in the sun. Accidentally hit the bottle over and now the patio looks like a badly cleaned murder scene..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-06 20:22:07	Got the greatest compliment I could ever possibly get today 🙏❤
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-01 14:01:23	My 5 month old laptop just broke. We do not have the money to fix it. Fml. Goodbye all my first year college stuff and all my photos 😰😢😭
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 20:04:29	Perri popcorn is so addictive
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 20:09:29	@DAlbaFernandez I'm coming close.. On 4 at the moment #sotasty
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 20:17:28	About 15 mins into Training Day and I have no idea what's going on
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 20:51:58	This really annoys me. I suggest something to my parents, they turn me down and a few weeks later, they're suggesting I do what I suggested
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-06-30 20:52:45	All that time ago. But by then, it's too late to do it 😡 #badbuzz
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-01 16:11:18	I have a decision to make. Go to this running yoke to keep my mam happy or keep myself happy, not go and let my mam be pissed at me again 😰😕
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-01 17:18:54	Biggest risk I take is eating food that says 'made in a factory that handles wheat and gluten' on the packet
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-01 17:19:39	Suffering a tad bit now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-07 16:44:14	Commiserations Galway. Congratulations Murray. #Clashofthesports
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-01 20:07:52	Dad fixed my laptop! What a genius
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-01 20:21:53	Not gonna lie. I missed someone's face, so I was creepin. Risky business that is..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-01 20:24:21	This time last year. I wanna be there. In the sun. With American gluten free mac n cheese. By the pool. With tropical tropicana #bringmeback
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-01 21:13:35	Me: What's that noise? Why do they do that?
Eamonn: That's the bull putting the cows into calving again! Sure, it's only natural!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-01 21:14:05	I don't think I've laughed that hard in weeks
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-01 21:29:36	Nettle stings and getting stuck in the trees. The price I pay to be accepted by my own brother and cousin #sad
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-01 22:46:49	I removed my glasses so I could wash my face. Now, I'm quite blind without them but, the spider that spiralled from the light beside my face
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-01 22:48:21	was very hard to miss. I was not gonna let it make a web around my toothbrush, so I killed that mofo! I feel so proud of myself #growingup
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-07 13:49:03	Watching Wimbledon and gaa makes me wish I'd more of an interest in playing these sports myself #lazyfecker
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-08 12:06:56	Having a strangely productive day. Am I sick?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-08 16:42:08	I don't like the sounds of this 😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-08 18:09:47	Got sunburnt on my face today, around my bumblebee sunglasses.. Dad says I look ridiculous. This is not good
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-08 18:11:01	@S0METW4T_ 😱 so cuuute! I thought it looked more like a lion at first. But that's just me.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-09 19:44:43	I love my surname
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-09 20:16:24	@DAlbaFernandez :O shambles! But at least you didn't think it was Kilmartin, like so many -_-
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-10 10:50:33	Blurred lines is my current obsession #iknowyouwantit
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-11 20:32:15	Who needs a hairdresser when the sun dyes your hair blonde naturally #freehighlights
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-11 20:32:35	August 11th 😱😍☺
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-11 21:52:17	@Clio_ws what's your secret deary? Please share &lt;3
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-11 22:34:41	Judging by fb and twitter, I seem to be one of the few who are actually bearing this heat. I'm sleeping wonderfully lately
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-12 07:40:17	This too shall pass
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-12 07:52:28	@RascalFlattsIRE would love to but can't make it :( thanks for letting me know about it though
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-14 09:02:25	Romantic day out planned with Sinead today 😚 following in my Gaga's footsteps and bringing her to a Gaelic match #maddenstyle
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-14 09:03:20	Should be some game today #LeinsterFinal #CmonMeath
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-14 09:29:20	@Adamnoble123 daydreams like that can destroy a mans mind. You'd wanna be careful now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-14 09:39:05	I gotta be honest.. It's hard to find fault with @Andrew_J_Morley 🙈 the man is perfect 😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-14 09:42:49	@rascalflatts tonight 😄😍😱 can't believe the night is finally here! Can't wait to finally see you @GaryLevox @JayDeMarcus @JoeDonRooney 😘
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-14 09:43:56	I did not get enough sleep last night for me to successfully survive today. But I accept the challenge #determined
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-12 15:34:55	Problems. Everywhere.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-12 15:39:51	I really wish I could freeze time and just sort everything out without having to worry about time passing 😰😫
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-12 19:24:34	Somewhere between walking upstairs and coming back downstairs, I lost my phone. I havent used it in months and now that I need it, it's gone
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-12 21:09:41	I'm like my Nana. I get far too excited when someone mentions Achill #obsessed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-12 22:34:44	I actually love Suits
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-13 11:17:03	It's only after 12 and I'm already exhausted #coffeecentral
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-14 23:28:37	The greatest concert ever. It has literally changed my life.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-15 19:02:23	@Clio_ws @rascalflatts yup,opening song and i'm sorry, but it was incredible! They were just amazing #nowords I'm even more in love

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-16 11:12:53	I think I may be just waiting for a call that will never come..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-16 11:19:26	Sometimes, it feels this world is spinning faster than it did in the old days

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-18 12:49:14	Bought a ticket that apparently means I can travel to and from Sligo as much as I like for a month 😏 you're in trouble now Sligo
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-18 13:51:39	I do love me some @ScottyMcCreery though
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-17 21:43:15	Procrastinating.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-18 14:06:56	The smell of smoke actually makes me feel physically sick now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-18 14:52:39	Just saw a child absolutely bawl her eyes out as her dad waved goodbye towards my window. Im sorry, was it my face again? #plagued #poorkid
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-18 14:58:46	You can't go wrong with Hey Ya! I'm jealous of his fro http://t.co/uFJIqCNNEa
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-22 12:41:43	I can't afford to love anymore
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-22 12:43:14	Oh my, that was supposed to be live.. I'm not that down trodden!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-22 17:01:46	I took 12 videos over the course of 2 nights out in Sligo. And to be honest, they're so much better than photos
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-26 12:23:48	👌 not sure why but that actually annoys me. A lot.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-26 12:25:04	@rascalflatts Your performance of Stand in Dublin changed my life. Thank you 💜😊
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-25 20:10:11	If only I could be payed for being a hermit

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-26 23:38:12	Slight change in the weather and I get a cold 😞
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-27 10:53:04	I can never seem to keep a conversation going. I'm always the one who makes the awkward response that kills the conversation
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-27 10:53:44	And then I can never recover. I.. I just.. I don't know where to go next. I don't know what to do. Okay.. Bye.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-27 16:36:47	Vegetable soup, then strawberries and grapes. Struggling to keep this down. #toomuchfood #toofilling

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-08-02 22:44:19	The heartbreaking moment when something you put in your basket is no longer available. I couldn't afford it anyway, but it's the principle
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-30 21:58:15	C'mon the Gaels! May only be under 14's, but Blackhall is on the rise ;)
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-31 21:48:02	Listening to iRadio at the moment. Walking round saying it was 50 Shades of Grey. And unknowingly shouted yes when it was confirmed..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-08-01 11:59:15	@Clio_ws :o YES! #soexcited #cantwait
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-07-31 21:48:33	My parents were around and were very confused by my words. Created a slightly awkward situation.

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-08-10 12:43:47	One more dawn. One more day. One day more. 😄

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-03 17:27:08	Judging by that last retweet, I need a whiskey. The cold Atlantic wind did not help my actual cold #bleh
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-04 22:53:09	Being a bitch about one of my best friends to another, cause in pissed off. And really sad. Good thing I'm wearing black #mournful

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-10 13:46:10	Drove into Maynooth to get bread. They had no bread. And still, I spent a fortune. #hmm
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-10 18:22:03	Forgot how stressful it was to do a maths question that has a typo. But the satisfaction when you figure it all out! #worthit #nerd
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-08 02:41:22	Took about 40 photos of 2 specific people shifting. Good night me thinks.

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-11 18:35:20	It's that time of year again. The time when daddy long legs put the fear of an apocalypse in me and cover every wall of the house #ew
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-14 11:55:44	Can't believe I'm only home a week. Feels like so much longer. #bringmeback #please

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-14 15:07:38	@jkHolian can't afford it :( being unemployed but very social just doesn't suit me
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-14 15:19:11	I think the hermit life may suit me now til next weekend
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-14 15:32:33	@RyanD14 was contemplating not going but I will. My presence in society may be limited from here on out so I better make one last splash

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-14 16:55:58	Recent snapchats from @N0_Just_N0 and @princessbekah_ make me grateful that I live at home and have my mam to deal with spiders #blessed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-14 19:39:41	Xfactor makes you realize that people are not always as normal as they look
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-14 19:47:15	I don't even like x factor. What am I doing?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-15 12:29:41	@princessbekah_ you named it fluffy? I thought leonie was coming to the rescue with the shovel yesterday?

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-18 17:01:48	Have you ever wanted to know what people really think of you?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-16 17:21:38	@obriensiobhan oh no, those complaints will come next week :P Just migraines
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-16 17:22:08	I want a relationship like Robyn and Dr. Phil have
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-16 18:34:32	Oh yes http://t.co/SpcfbQVNcZ

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-18 21:17:00	I'm actually writing a letter, that will be posted tomorrow. Now I see why this form of communication stopped. It's so difficult to compose
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-18 23:25:56	There is a donkey somewhere making a lot of noise. This is not amusing
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-24 08:38:26	Found one of my fourth (or so) cousins last night, and all because I was wearing my mayo jersey #thankyoumayo
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-24 08:53:59	Biomed with Marion later #killmenow
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-21 22:11:38	When you need people to text you back but they won't #ahh #frustrated
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-24 10:47:26	@ConThePrawn he lost me at Euclidean.. It was far better than what I'm suffering through now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-22 11:43:50	Third wheeling it into Dublin to cheer on Mayo #MayoforSam
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-24 21:11:45	Because yes, you should be holding your shoes climbing along a cliff edge. http://t.co/IwG1P1ubLI
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-22 21:18:47	Next year, lads. Next year. #MayoForSam
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-25 14:54:19	Do I have a face that screams 'Circus performers welcome for a chat'? I love college
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-22 22:29:44	I can't believe I'm gonna say this but I kinda wish I was still in Dublin. It's great craic when there's west of Ireland peeps there
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-22 22:30:16	Otherwise, no. I can't. I just, can't.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-23 08:54:57	This is gonna be like starting first year again. Is nobody else doing maths?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-23 09:06:15	@ConThePrawn just knowing that I won't be going through this alone actually makes it that little bit more bearable
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-27 09:46:13	I feel like I'm being taught by Arnold Schwarzenegger  #itstheaccent
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-29 20:10:01	@MinajestyPink yup, along the Atlantic Drive :)
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-29 20:39:29	@MinajestyPink me too! It's so amazing, isn't it? Aw, I'm so glad I'm not the only one obsessed with it :P
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-29 20:41:22	Maths assignment: 'Sketch the graph of..' Eh, how about, no.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-01 12:13:45	If this is it, I really think we should try for another @princessbekah_ http://t.co/uGoYMc46LE
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-27 19:39:43	The Holiday 😍 #perfect
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-28 13:51:09	I was made do the dishes as punishment for being stupid enough to do this. Believe it or not, I am studying science http://t.co/xal5w8qOm5
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-28 13:59:39	@RyanD14 salt and ice challenge

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-30 09:58:55	Chans mother would not like me 😔

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-30 15:30:24	You're actually so annoying. Please go away.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-01 21:40:52	Ate nearly 2 breasts of chicken today. I don't think I've ever had that much chicken in one week, let alone one day! #canthandleit 🐔❌😖
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-30 19:08:14	My hand is actually getting better 😁 #yay
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-28 22:00:07	@niamhmimnagh I had to. They questioned my sudden inability to drive and my constant wincing. Nah, we can still play. Just no more salt
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-02 10:15:02	Well ESB were true to their word and they shit off the power at exactly half 9. That hour before leaving for college was a struggle
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-02 11:03:29	Limping around college. Oh this will be a fun day..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-02 12:14:46	If you are lame, that's a shame, you can't hang with uuus
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-02 12:22:23	Just casually rapping in my head in biology #asyado
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-29 13:34:01	Sat down to study and all I can hear is music and dogs barking. Whoever is blaring music, singing extremely loudly and pissing off all dogs
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-29 13:34:04	Please stop. Please.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-09-29 20:07:33	My parents are convinced that I'm a severely heavy smoker. My chesty cough isn't helping my pleas of denial. #tension

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-04 11:39:49	I'm far too easily amused
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-05 13:22:40	My skin has gone to absolute shit lately 😪😩😭
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-05 17:12:47	Anyone wanna go Aussie rules with me?

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-04 16:06:17	I send snapchats too often..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-05 19:35:21	Star gazing ⭐😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-06 00:05:53	I've said it before and I'll say it again. I don't know how anyone can work with feet, or even bare them #eww
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-05 20:55:01	I feel like I'm betraying my past self when a song I once hated becomes my new favourite song.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-07 09:12:29	@princessbekah_ I see you.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-07 09:15:19	Why anyone with naturally curly hair would want to straighten it is beyond me
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-07 10:03:18	Memories of @princessbekah_ flying off the slide makes me giggle
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-07 12:05:39	Hot scones. Yus.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-07 13:36:40	Isn't the point of Learning outcome q's that they're supposed to be based on what we've learned? Not what you've never taught us, Marion 😡
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-05 17:03:38	Maths assignment for this week, done. I feel accomplished. #thankyoumatrices
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-06 00:04:39	I would absolutely love to have a movie type winters night

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-11 08:19:29	Was about to buy a 2 day C2C ticket when I realise that I can't go on the 15th 😭

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-11 22:09:23	@RascalFlattsIRE @C2Cofficial @rascalflatts I would give anything to be able to go but unfortunately, I can't :( ty for the info though :)
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-11 22:12:03	I wanna be better by tomorrow :( I hate being sick, especially when I can't do anything to make myself better #coeliacproblems
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-08 15:41:55	Between Snapped in Nuim and Maynooth Shifters, nobody is safe anymore. The shifters one is just creepy though..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-09 14:36:23	My legs just buckled after I got back from running. I don't know if that's cause they're weak, I'm unfit, I haven't eaten or I'm drunk.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-09 14:37:12	I always forget to log off Facebook chat so it looks like I have nothing better to do than go on in the hope that someone will talk to me
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-09 14:38:56	@zacbrownband I'm beyond excited that you're coming to Ireland 😄❤🍀 thank you so much! If I get tickets, I'll be even happier 😁 #loveyous

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-08 19:09:02	Having those 2 espressos within half an hour today was just as good as getting drunk #sojittery
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-08 19:11:52	@Farrell03 okay, okay. Whatever ya want to tell yourself. Are ya gonna be out celebrating again?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-08 19:16:54	@Farrell03 it never stops. Ah but sure, why not? Ya better not keep me up when im in Maynooth again.. I'll be on to your mother

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-16 10:39:04	Today was a day for staying in bed. I should have listened to my morning self.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-15 09:17:13	I've only started and I can see already that today is gonna be a fail
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-10-15 09:32:50	First anniversary of meeting @niamhmimnagh today 🙈🙊

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-10 13:34:12	You have problems @RebekahBowden http://t.co/Y5x0TjQ7uq
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-10 13:38:52	@RebekahBowden no love? :(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-08 22:32:06	@RebekahBowden not sure. Probably won't know til tomorrow morning.. :P
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-08 23:32:46	@RebekahBowden won't matter to you anyway, you've sketches to be doing at that time
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-10 22:04:11	Every time I've a little vent to my mam about how stressed I am, she consoles me with the same comment, 'Life's a bitch, and then you die'
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-10 22:05:30	Words of absolute wisdom and reassurance. Thanks mam. Appreciate it. Not gonna lie, I'm still stressed though
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-11 12:21:30	I really miss you.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-11 23:29:31	Why is second year so much tougher than first year? #idontlikeit
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-11 00:08:32	@ScottyMcCreery is beautiful. And don't even get me started on his voice. #IthinkIminlove
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-09 12:00:21	Was gonna go into town tonight and creep on Will Ferrell and the crew but, of course, I'm working #ruiningmylife #whosgonnastalkthemnow
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-12 10:28:01	Yesterday, a guy walked in late to our lecture. There were 10 mins left. Today, I was 2 mins late for a lecture and didnt go in. Ashamed? No
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-11 12:23:25	They've started putting people names on the cups in the on campus Starbucks. Think it's time I start using a fake name #ciaranmurphy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-13 09:27:08	Failure of this mcq today is inevitable #ahwell
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-12 15:16:37	So happy right now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-13 14:01:30	Which is worse? A lie that brings a smile or the truth that draws a tear? #IRestMyCase ❤
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-13 15:51:10	Mother Nature, I think you missed the memo. Where's the snow? 😢
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-13 16:00:52	@RyanD14 yeah, first time in about 112 years apparently! Crazy stuff. Been a few months since we've had some though, we need it..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-15 21:09:25	The only reason I'm watching XFactor is to watch Elton John 😍😍 be my best friend, please?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-17 16:08:17	Well, it's not surprising that the people of Maynooth are not happy. Wouldn't be surprised if the college cancel Christmas Day next year
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-16 09:15:16	Thank god my mam was here to help me #sosore
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-17 00:34:36	What's worse than feeling terribly awful? Cause thats how I feel right now #absolutelywoeful #Theworst
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-17 20:57:30	#CornyCentral Got the loveliest Christmas card today and it made me so grateful for the lovely people I've come to meet over the years. ❤💜
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-21 11:09:13	Olcott and Gauntier 😍 #socute
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-21 12:46:11	Far from impressed. Dog gets away, I'm the one who has to look for her and so, I'm the one who has to clean cow shite off her face #always
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-18 10:51:11	I've decided that these last few good weeks compensate for this fail week. To be fair, it is Christmas week after all though
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-18 11:08:31	@CHRIS_Daughtry Learn My Lesson  #nowplaying #loveit But understanding the lyrics 😔 #feelinghurt
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-20 10:33:15	I just wasn't meant to make it to maths today. It wasn't meant to be. No point in breaking this weeks apparent tradition either
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-20 10:39:37	My attempt at doing a good deed today backfired.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-20 16:00:36	Pretty sure the missed call on my phone is from work. Ah well, wouldn't have made it in anyway #sorryimnotsorry #yeah #iwentthere

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-24 18:44:42	Got a Merry Christmas hug from someone I started work with #workfriends 😄😉
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-24 22:00:48	@PaulaCoMayo aw no, that's awful :( did they get it back out to the sea?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-24 22:59:43	@islandgooner @PaulaCoMayo that is just heartbreaking :(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-24 23:17:03	Ya know your music taste is not normal for your age when you know all the songs Tommy Fleming is singing and your mam doesnt..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-25 23:13:26	The thoughts of work tomorrow is proper depressing. The following three days off will be heavenly 👼👼
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-25 23:15:02	I need to go out tomorrow. And get drunk. Why is nobody going out tomorrow? 😒😞
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-22 15:35:35	According to my horoscope, my new love is a photographer #motherofpearl #snaphappypair
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-22 16:47:48	I really wanna go out. Who wants to join me? Please? I'll make it worth your while.. Candy canes for everyone!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-22 19:53:27	Certain people 😠
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-26 21:27:20	If my parents suddenly turned round and said 'we're moving back to Sligo', I wouldn't even question it. I'd be gone in the morning
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-29 00:17:02	I didn't send any Merry Christmas texts cause I wanted to see who would text me first. Realised a lot. Got quite hurt.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-29 00:18:47	I didn't have anyone's number to text them anyway. And I didn't look at my phone for hours that day. But yeah #conclusionsucks
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-29 00:30:24	When a science joke text turns into numerous reassuring texts 😊 #bestfriendconversations
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-27 00:09:10	One of those nights 😔💔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-29 15:18:05	11 pages down. 13 to go. I should really have one to these lectures myself. Would've saved me all this time of copying notes 😱
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-29 17:33:25	When I start to panic about college exams, I remind myself that it's not as bad as the Leaving Cert. Yet, that still doesn't calm me #help
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-29 19:29:49	@marko93101 you missed it.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-29 19:30:39	@RebekahBowden owes me for saving her both pain and embarrassment on the ice. #neverforget

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-27 12:42:49	Jammie day. These are not coming off. #ubercomfy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-27 18:16:32	Phone cannot answer or make calls. #banjaxed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-30 15:10:10	I think it's time I face the fact that I need a new phone. It's been with me through so much. Supporting mayo in the final, numerous falls
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-30 15:11:08	On nights out, refused to accept phone calls people, especially from work, when I wasn't in the mood to go in anyway. It's gonna be tough.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-30 15:11:37	I just hope my next phone understands me as well as you did bb.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-30 15:12:30	'Why am I always last?' 'Cause you're the most important' 😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-01 17:12:32	Remembering my time of naïvety when my gay friend asked me what was the POA, and I thought that meant 'Point of Access'. Happy New Year 🎉🎊🎈

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-30 22:46:05	So glad I'm not working tomorrow. Can get some study done, then drink so much that I forget everything I studied and make it more bearable 😁
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2013-12-31 18:32:42	Was quite jealous of anybody heading to Achill for New Years, especially since my plans to go fell through. Now I'm spitting jealous
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-02 14:46:02	My first exam is in 8 days. I went to one of all lectures. I have one book of lecture notes but I do not have the other. This will be awful.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-02 14:46:17	I feel I have learned nothing..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-02 22:35:20	People looking to get discounts because the item has no tag #fo

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-03 13:32:34	@RyanD14 yeah, heartbroken by pictures I'm seeing of Achill. It's horrific
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-05 01:09:45	http://t.co/ebogNQpFfz could watch this over and over and never grow tired of it 😂😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-05 01:46:12	It is 4am and you wants to poke me? Disgusting
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-05 01:48:01	I think I have another girl crush. Jennifer Lawrence, Rhiannon Fish, meet Superwoman
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-03 13:06:14	Hard to believe some of the pictures I'm seeing of the damage done by the storm last night. The sea is unbelievably powerful
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-03 15:21:18	I'm actually devastated by the damage done last night in Achill 😢 I have a feeling the seat is no more #ohthememories
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-03 15:34:08	I can't wait for the exams to be over. Simply so I can go away 😁😍 #cantwait

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-06 12:07:46	Set about 12 alarms for this morning in the hope that I'd get up somewhat early. I turned them all off and I'm only up. I regret nothing

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-07 18:45:07	@RebekahBowden I dunno? Is London romantic?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-06 00:54:33	@RyanD14 involve all the other topics, including insects and shizz. And that just doesn't appeal one at all 😖
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-06 00:57:53	@RyanD14 strangely enough (but thankfully) spiders never came up.. In other news, I killed my first spider today! Was quite the proud moment

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-07 20:29:18	@RebekahBowden sounds like a plan. I'll probably have given up by the end if your exam so that's grand #yaaay

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-08 23:08:36	Not enough time in a day. Woke up early but was nearly late to work cause I was studying. And now I'm home to do more study #ew

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-16 00:02:29	Performing a little concert in my room at the moment. All welcome.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-15 02:41:22	I love YouTube
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-15 03:08:47	I got more study done in the last few hours at home than I did the 7 hours I was in the library today. So annoyed #overtired
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-15 03:10:45	And yet, I'm still completely f*cked for this exam tomorrow #shootme 😩
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-15 03:12:23	Feel awful that my mam stayed awake til she knew I was home safe this evening. Really wish I'd gone home when she text.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-15 03:14:38	You annoy me. To a severe extent.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-15 03:14:58	I'm in that mood. Ya know when certain people really annoy you. I'm not in the mood to deal with you. #sorryimnotsorry
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-15 03:17:29	@zacbrownband are the only ones keeping me sane today #thankyou
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-14 11:10:57	@zacbrownband playing all morning 😍 perfect pre-exam music #chillaxed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-17 00:21:42	It's not okay for me to cry in public. Just, no.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-17 00:23:50	People change. I feel I've changed. I think it's for the better but the reaction of others seems to suggest otherwise. #wellgetusedtoit
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-17 00:43:29	I wish I could play the banjo
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-17 00:45:40	The more I plan my weeks holidays, the more excited I become 😍😮😏😉😊
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-17 00:47:28	@RyanD14 believe me, I'm trying. It's just very frustrating.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-17 11:45:55	Facebook on my computer has been ducked ever since I had it in college the other day. It's really quite annoying..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-17 15:14:12	I don't like to curse. I only curse when I'm really angry. I've been really angry the last few days. I don't like it #savemefrommyself
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-18 14:24:22	Before Christmas. My parents: What would you like for Christmas, Ciara? Me: Ah, nothing. Sure I have everything I need.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-18 14:25:43	After Christmas. Me: Oh my god. Need a new phone, laptop's on the brink and my cameras been broken for a year now. Is it Christmas yet?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-18 15:21:06	Love hearing sheep outside. Makes me feel like I'm in my second home
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-18 16:21:00	My dads a wrecking ball fan. Wait til he sees the video.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-17 16:35:17	@marko93101 :o can I have him? So cute
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-17 16:36:29	Frickin fresian!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-17 16:44:31	@marko93101 if I didn't have such bad luck with birds, I would. Besides, I can't be taking your calculus good luck charm
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-17 16:47:56	@marko93101 ya gotta name it now. I'm sure the nicer you are to it, the better your result! do ya want a loan of a cage for him/her?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-17 23:12:36	@marko93101 any advancements?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-17 23:14:26	@Stephen_Fay possibly.. I'm in work til 10 but I'll probably call in after for a while. Can't disappoint my 'baby face'! Whyyy? Are you?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-17 23:17:01	@marko93101 ah good. Being well looked after so! Probably won't want to leave ya now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-17 23:17:46	@marko93101 :( what ya gonna do with it?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-16 16:29:51	Finally bit the bullet and got iOs 7. Only 12 years late..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-18 00:30:56	Wondering why I was kept on in work at all. Can't do anything right anymore #disaster
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-18 01:09:40	Fucked isn't even a strong enough word. Calculus, you bitch.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-18 03:03:12	Well, waking up will be fun.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-18 11:55:31	Calculus chewed me up and spit me back out. Thank you, appreciate it.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-19 15:58:33	Less than a week now 😁 so excited
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-16 19:10:16	@rascalflatts - I Won't Let Go ❤️❤️
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-15 20:39:48	Finally got to watch the final episode of Sherlock #wow
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-15 20:42:13	And now catching up on HoD. The fact that it opened playing @zacbrownband was so exciting and it just keeps getting better and better
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-19 21:44:34	Elena and I were destined to meet. We're so compatible, it's unreal 💛😂😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-19 22:44:30	I always mean to buy a few particular things before work but then I forget what they are until I get home #dayum spent a lot all the same 😕😏
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-20 01:24:29	Cause pretending everything is alright, when it's not, really isn't working
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-20 01:25:16	Don't know whether the story of my dream last night was the weirdest thing or the person who was in it..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-20 01:37:47	I miss Terri :(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-20 01:38:38	I would love to be honest, but people don't seem to like that. I take your shit all the time. It's about time ya got your own back #ranting
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-20 01:43:44	Just doing the Hoedown throwdown #yep
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-20 01:46:27	@niamhmimnagh I can see a onesie hoedown throwdown session happening  Saturday. Be it alone or with numbers, music or not, I will do it.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-20 02:18:05	@niamhmimnagh it's a surprise ;) chances are, other people are gonna have the same one but sure! #begrand
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-20 13:19:59	Garth Brooks concert? Yes please 😍😁
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-20 14:10:48	Imagine Dragons - It's Time #obsessed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-20 15:20:06	@niamhmimnagh OH MY GOD! And the Cha Cha Slide :D #youhavebeenwarned
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-20 15:25:27	Thought I'd go for a walk during my study break. Only while I was on my walk did I realise that I haven't even started studying #ahwell
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-20 15:26:26	I can cover 18 biology lectures in a day and a half, right? #begrand
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-21 14:42:31	One more. Just one more exam. And then it's all over. You'd think I'd be trying my hardest for this one. Nope. Currently shopping online.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-21 15:41:12	Ain't nobody love nobody, the way that I love you
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-21 19:56:38	I'm one of those people who has to make my bed before I go sleep in it
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-22 11:38:39	Was messing around the other day and ended up elbowing myself in the knee #cleverciara left quite the bruise too #dontknowmyownstrength
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-21 21:45:57	Earlier, every step I took led to Cindy jumping at me. My dog is crazy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-23 00:58:28	Well I did not envision the end of my day involving the clean up of dog poo. #funtimes
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-21 00:33:42	Have a severe headache that is preventing any chance of sleep #help
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-21 00:48:05	Just realised that I won't see Elena for about two weeks 😟 I think my heart just broke a little 😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-21 00:48:41	@RebekahBowden ain't got none :( #sosore #andsleepy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-21 00:51:33	@RebekahBowden naw, thank you 😘 might do that. Trying everything but getting nowhere. I'm so frustrated now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-21 00:54:45	@RebekahBowden that shouldn't take long
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-23 14:49:48	Oh how I love my dad
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-22 21:06:55	Eventful day. Exams finished, exciting adventure, pizza and won €2 on a scratch card. #yus
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-22 21:18:18	@RebekahBowden @Blue_Dragon_XX your selfies are making me laugh beyond control
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-22 22:50:37	My dream the other night involved @TheRock. We became best friends and took lots of photos together. I woke up to no photos of Dwayne and I😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-24 14:26:30	@RebekahBowden @CelineHolloway1 I don't know why we don't have more friends. We're just so fun!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-24 20:36:00	So frustrated
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-24 14:52:11	@RebekahBowden chan's birthday was it? Halloween? Oh wow. #disaster
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-24 22:43:48	Started crying while watching a movie. My mam came over and gave me a hug. I continued to cry. #storyofmylife
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-25 00:15:37	I've been avoiding this moment for months. And I chose now, when I should be in bed recooperating, to clean my room. Fun night ahead.. #boo
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-25 01:23:19	A few months ago, I bruised my hip quite badly. Thought nothing of it. It hasn't gone away. And it's still sore #boo
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-24 17:26:10	I don't like bus eireanns website.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-24 19:29:53	@RebekahBowden my emotions: 😂 😀 😳 😱 😂 😥 😶
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-25 10:42:12	Probably shouldn't have stated up so late cleaning. Slept through my alarm. 😔😫😖😰
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-25 10:45:02	I need a day just to myself. So I can just sleep and relax all day #exhausted
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-25 10:45:26	This week off is well needed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-25 11:35:05	😖 #sick think I may have my mams flu
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-25 14:41:21	When I put my iPod on shuffle and don't skip One Direction, I worry.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-25 14:59:29	How can people leave their curtains closed all day.. I just don't understand it
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-25 15:00:40	Anybody here, pass me a beer?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-25 15:14:48	Haven't touched my book this entire journey. Ah, I'm literate enough. #begrand
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-27 21:23:58	12 hours, 4 different buses, no sleep, no food. Well, the main thing is, I'm here ❤️💚😁😍 #happyout
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-28 09:50:51	@RebekahBowden yup. 'Twas a long oul day. Proved that having a plan b is very important! 😉😳😜 but I gots a nice sleep #allgood
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-28 13:07:29	Chillin like a villain #happyout
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-28 13:49:58	@RebekahBowden no, wasn't alive at that hour. got the half 9 though. The buses were disastrous. Nope, they were all closed when I got there😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-29 10:51:21	It's raining. I'm not quite sure what I'm to do with my time now.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-29 18:23:26	I can't remember the last time I was this happy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-29 18:24:06	So confused. Dunno what to do tomorrow
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-29 19:33:57	Lads, I really don't wanna leave. I can't even express it in words how badly I wanna stay. Depression will set in the second I leave.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 12:51:56	Genuinely nearly started crying in the middle of an adorable café. I think I need help..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 13:47:26	We don't know what we've got, til it's gone. Like it or not.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 13:48:41	The really cute cafe earlier also did gluten free chocolate cake and gluten free vanilla moose. Was livin it up!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 13:50:09	Although, I didn't get any.. Got soup instead #savoury #whoop was so tasty
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 13:50:55	Feel like I'm doing a live commentary of my life. I'll stop now.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-29 23:01:49	This is the first day, in my entire life, that I have not seen or, in any way, communicated with my mother. Something's wrong.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-29 23:06:36	Feel guilty asking to be put up for another night. I need to get my own house here 😉
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-01 21:13:28	Just reminiscing on a few past nicknames.. #schmidtty http://t.co/zCyqTbD9pI
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-02 00:19:26	You're damned if you do and damned if you don't. So you might as well just do whatever you want
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-30 11:32:18	This would be amazing, if it didn't contain a grammar mistake 😒 #nerd http://t.co/9GEaNbNRH3
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-30 13:02:15	Finally got a good look at the shore road today and to say that I'm devastated would be an understatement 😢💔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-30 13:08:34	It's hard to believe that the sea could be that powerful http://t.co/w05QPphPfV
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-30 15:57:37	You can't describe the sea, unless you've been there before. It's just a mystery, til you're standing on the shore. Moved by every wave
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 21:45:45	I left Achill Island on the wrong day 😔 #fucksake #wheresthesnowfortheeast
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 21:46:16	When I was younger, I would cry because I was away from home and my family. Now, I cry when I get home and see my family
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 21:49:13	It's not that I don't love my family, cause I do beyond believe, but it's the people here. Once ya cross the border, it all changes
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 21:57:57	Well I guess I got no valentine. Send me flowers, I just let em die.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 23:17:26	I should keep a diary. Too many people are on twitter now. Can't rant without someone getting upset #notliketheoldendays
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 23:18:08	The atm is stolen in Tubber and one is installed in the Sound the following day. Suspicious. I think we know who stole Tubbers atm #jokes
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 23:31:10	@RyanD14 tisnt as fun as it was back at the beginning
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 23:33:47	@RyanD14 yup, 3 followers and we were happy out! Still don't care how many I have, only about their judgements -_- #peepsberuiningtwitter
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 23:35:15	It's a lyric tweeting kinda day/night
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 23:37:35	It's strange what ya can come across when you're just randomly scrolling through your news feed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 23:38:50	It's a really weird coincidence but I'm slightly heartbroken 😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 23:40:35	@RyanD14 I'd rather they just unfollow me 😜 Then I'd be more comfortable tweeting what I really want
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 23:41:48	What if our love never went away? What if it's lost behind words we could never find?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 23:42:59	He was stoned! Ahh, it all makes sense now 😂😳😧
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-31 23:48:58	Brigid's bringing the snow! #honthebrigid ⛄️❄️
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-01 00:00:33	I miss my bf 😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-01 00:03:39	Wow. That awkward moment when ya find photos of yourself that ya accidentally took cause ya thought the camera was the other way #cringe
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-01 00:04:35	The only saving grace is that I'm smiling in most of them
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-01 00:07:23	I'm tweeting a lot today. #sorryimnotsorry
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-01 14:56:07	Came gone yesterday to fresh sheets aaand a new quilt 😍 I don't think I'll be getting out of bed today
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-01 15:24:27	Turned on the crackedi the other night and I did not hear the voices of Chris and Ciara. Have I missed something?? What's going on? :o :(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-01 15:26:06	My brother's an idiot.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-30 23:47:48	Being friendly, I shook the hand of a man, I just met tonight, while he was saying goodbye. He seemed nice. Quiet. Shy. Slightly strange..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-01-30 23:49:04	Then, while shaking my hand, he said 'I would love to see you again. Ya know, I'm a gigalo.' And left. Disturbed? Yes. I was.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-01 17:37:31	What annoys me most about that neck nomination is the fact that loads of good drink went to waste. I could've enjoyed all that ya dope!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-02 16:54:52	If ya pass the point where it's not just your breath that's stinks of alcohol, you've had enough. And so has everyone else.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-02 22:45:45	Back to reality tomorrow 😔 #ugh
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-03 00:25:42	I get far too emotionally involved in the books I read.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-03 16:19:54	First day back at work after a week and a half off. This should be interesting..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-04 18:15:13	Almost that time of day 😍 http://t.co/rrGAo2pZ3w
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-05 17:01:10	People talking bout roads being destroyed in Kerry. That's already happened in Achill and there was nothing about it #justsaying
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-05 18:56:41	Scared.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-05 09:53:38	To say I feel like shit today would be an understatement. The cold has finally got to me 😔😖
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-05 11:42:48	Tis not my day
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-05 12:10:13	Forgot my purse 😡😢
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-06 16:23:42	@RebekahBowden Oh. My. You. Bitch. 😱😳
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-06 23:46:07	Somewhere Only We Know ❤️
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-06 23:54:39	I've reached the limit. I give up 😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-06 23:56:27	I'm actually so hurt.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-06 05:13:42	Realising that certain people don't value you as much as you value them is one of the hardest things to go through
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-09 02:16:01	Didn't miss feeling like this anyway. #shit 😞
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-09 02:21:35	It's just a phase
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-09 03:49:17	I'm getting old and I need someone to rely on
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-09 03:51:07	I'm obsessed with this song. I need to learn it on piano
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-07 22:38:29	Me + my bed = the perfect combination 😴☁️😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-10 11:42:15	@RyanD14 @mcd_productions HO. LY. FUCK! My life is complete 😲😱😁😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-08 15:25:08	How can anyone exist in a world where nobody is who they seem to be?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-09 14:46:08	Oh Meath 😰😫
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-09 14:47:26	My mam has had an awful cold for the last few weeks and she complains about it not going away, but she's not doing anything to stop it
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-09 14:48:00	And at this stage, her cough is not only annoying her 😷😫
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-09 14:48:48	On another note, I finished my book last night and of course, I cried. I'm not quite sure what to do with myself now.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-10 23:09:57	I don't get the whole Pandora thing
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-10 23:50:31	People my age getting engaged left, right and centre. Ah now. Seriously lads?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-11 21:50:41	My reaction to every song on the cd @RebekahBowden @niamhmimnagh #loveit http://t.co/uyMVb0jGVL
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-11 22:41:35	Don't ya wanna feel this fire, before it's gone
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-11 23:52:03	Tired but can't sleep. I'm just getting crankier by the minute
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-11 11:56:43	Does anyone know if we need lab coats for the bio labs today? Anybody?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-11 12:12:01	I'm not sure how my mam is gonna take the news of Shirley Temples death #diehardfan
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-12 16:07:33	I don't mind the rain. I'd just prefer if it was snow.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-11 16:01:25	Maths results are out. Fuck.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-11 18:31:50	Why are people so anti-snow? You're such grinchs
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-13 11:30:20	Only home and I realise the car is basically out of petrol. I'm gonna get some bollocking for that 😳😔😰
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-13 11:31:09	@RebekahBowden YOU TOOK IT OUT OF CONTEXT. I look weird now.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-13 12:36:38	Ticketmaster. You're taking the piss now. I just wanna buy tickets. Please. Let me? Stop being a prick.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-13 15:48:15	I'm gonna miss what seems like a really good night. This is one of the downfalls of being employed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-13 15:48:25	Being a coeliac is hard 😩😷😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-13 17:01:32	Dunno what to think or how to feel
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-14 09:20:16	I stink of cigarette smoke. I think I'm gonna be sick if I'm around myself any longer. #ohshit
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-14 09:40:45	In deep, deep trouble
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-14 09:42:11	Finally won a game of twister last night😄 #thankyoutom #twistoff
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-14 18:12:30	I wanna head west again soon
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-14 20:35:26	I wanna go hiking
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-14 20:35:46	Clear the head
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-14 20:36:54	This time it was bigger than the strength she had to get up off her knees 🎶
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-14 13:41:54	@RebekahBowden 😒 too far. You spoiled it
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-18 17:34:08	Why Kate let Brennan go, I will never understand
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-18 18:29:47	My heads a mess, cause you got me growing taller every day
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-18 18:30:15	I'm trying so hard not to let it show
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-18 20:14:33	At some point last night, I lost the contents of my locket. I feel incomplete. And sad. And lost.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-18 21:17:30	Wrecking Ball. I'm beginning to get it
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-18 22:09:26	YES! Finally got my tickets 😁😍 I will finally get to see Daughtry 😄💚💜 http://t.co/Q6KaEDzFVF
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-18 23:14:25	When I fall, I fall hard
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-18 23:15:30	Can't sleep. So tired. But just cannot sleep
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-19 11:48:25	I need to start getting my shit together
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-19 12:26:51	Can't wait for this day to be over #takingforever
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-19 13:46:19	Everybody. Come out tonight. Yes? See you all there 😉
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-19 14:48:26	Niamh is gonna dig me a hole with a crane, I'm gonna crawl into it and Beka is gonna fill it over #funfamilyactivities
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-16 18:48:27	That was the longest shift of my life. And then I nearly fell down the stairs on my way out. #classy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-16 19:42:28	Hahaha quite true http://t.co/6J1nypGCDq
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-19 17:18:37	I need to go to Achill again. Now.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-16 22:34:12	Whenever I need a laugh, I just look at the before and after pictures of Tom's face 😂😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-18 10:33:28	Explains why I'm so mucky today http://t.co/N1kLZI1MAT
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-19 18:45:50	Being as indecisive as I am is quite the curse
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-19 18:48:48	Kinda scared about how I'm going to react
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-19 19:09:21	10 feet tall
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-19 19:39:12	I'll always remember you ❤️😢
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-19 19:41:09	My brother has a better social life than me.. He's heading out tomorrow while I'll be at home sobbing #postworkblues #lifeblues
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-18 16:23:55	My blackberry finally gave in. I am now using a golden oldie. It's so golden that it even has a bebo app #yup
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-18 16:36:10	I, like so many others, question my actions sometimes. Some things ya just can't explain 😳😂😋
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-18 16:58:07	Chips. Yay.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-18 16:59:52	I need to stop throwing my money around 😰😣
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-20 03:35:49	'Drank from the boob' instead of 'breast feeding' classy @RebekahBowden
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-20 03:44:34	Don't know what to do
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-20 09:42:53	The pain of losing you was worth the joy of having you ❤️
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-20 09:44:39	Working 3 nights a week and weekends, and being in college, is just too much to handle
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-20 15:54:17	Having such a fail day #someoneholdme
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-20 16:38:08	@RebekahBowden please 😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-14 15:37:14	Can't explain it
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-14 15:58:27	This day 4 weeks. C2C 😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-14 21:26:05	I wish I lived in Bluebell
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-14 22:02:38	I, eh, yeah
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-14 22:02:48	Bitches running wild
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-23 14:39:22	So addicted to this song :o &lt;3
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-23 14:48:29	Don't know who I want to win today #torn
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-23 22:29:58	Was craving pizza but decided against it. Now I wish I'd gone with the pizza..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-23 22:38:04	A nice country accent. That's always good 😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-23 23:08:45	If getting into bed was an Olympic sport, I would always lose. I always spend ages getting ready to just get into bed. What am I even doing?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-23 23:09:33	Hell yeah #happyout http://t.co/NArydli6UP
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-23 23:10:01	I wanna go out
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-23 23:10:17	But I need to save #dilemma
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-22 17:50:06	@RebekahBowden last week, I wrote 'we head to the wesht?' on a postit. The answer was 'Yes' and it happened #happydays #loveclaire
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-22 18:17:13	Think with your heart and not your head. That way you'll be much happier
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-22 18:19:28	@RebekahBowden 😂😂 there are a lot of other things I could right too. We should just have a postit day
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-22 19:10:12	Slept for 14 blissful hours, stayed in my jammies all day and arranged a trip to the west. There exists no better way to spend a day off 😊💜
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-22 19:12:23	@RebekahBowden 😱 I didn't even notice that. I feel so ashamed 😔 had to have been autocorrect. I wouldn't. Would I? 😳😔 #brainismush
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-22 19:18:12	I adore Julia Roberts
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-16 11:47:15	Woke up singing Life's What You Make It to myself. Is it strange that I think it's changed my life? 😂😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-21 11:20:53	I can't do this
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-21 11:50:28	This has just been a shit week. Absolutely shit.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-21 13:35:18	Life's a bitch. And then ya die.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-21 13:43:50	It's sad that I feel the need to apologise for all my future tweets
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-21 14:17:02	Annoyed at myself for how I feel
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-21 15:15:30	Nearly cried when I saw my dads face. I need tomorrow to come now. Not in the mood for work 😔😫😭
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-21 16:33:31	Jules just brightened my day http://t.co/HTzN8PMx0k
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-23 14:38:09	Don't you think it's time to get it on
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-23 14:38:21	Don't you want to feel this fire before it's gone
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-22 00:05:46	Last night, I found messages on my phone that I would have preferred never to see again. The timing of my discovery was very strange though
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-22 00:08:29	Was so sad. And still am. Can't believe it's been 2 years
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-25 00:03:57	She I read my horoscope, I either feel scared, excited or oblivious. Not sure if I believe them.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-24 10:03:08	Mam got a tablet. This should be interesting
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-25 09:43:44	Oh my good god. Please f*ck off
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-25 10:20:38	@marko93101 nope
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-25 10:29:51	Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-25 12:29:42	This week started out so well. Then I started assignments and I've just reached the stage of 'no.' #justno
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-25 19:18:49	You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-25 19:19:50	Life http://t.co/gq8Y0Aanoq
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-25 21:42:42	Love looking through photos
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-26 00:10:57	*Sung to Get Lucky tune* We're up all night to get work done #woo #singlelife
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-27 12:23:39	Bite marks all over my knuckles
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-27 12:57:21	Had 3 Golden days and then came today #fail
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-27 16:43:22	Whoever is the lucky sod to end up spending their life with @ScottyMcCreery just know that I will be eternally jealous of you
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-26 11:13:18	Haven't been able to see this clearly in a long time. This is strange
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-28 17:28:38	This could be awkward. Sleeping in a double bed and neither of us have pajamas @RebekahBowden
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-28 18:13:48	Wasn't expecting that
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-28 20:03:18	I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-28 20:03:45	Location ❤️❤️
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 14:05:22	@RebekahBowden Mary appeared there 😉 #iknowmyshit
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 14:12:59	@RebekahBowden Tis. Tastes so good too
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 14:20:08	@RebekahBowden I really need to develop a filter between my brain and mouth. Should think before I speak
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 14:21:07	Yeah I'm emotional. Blame it on your mental jokes.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 14:21:48	@RebekahBowden don't think fine moments exist for me anymore
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 15:26:44	I'm trying so hard not to let it show, but you got me feeling like I'm standing on buildings, cars and boats
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-27 22:28:03	Really wish I was going out. Just in that mood
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-27 22:29:58	Will not be in the mood for that tomorrow #fo
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-27 22:58:05	People wonder why I don't trust them. If I can't rely on people for something small, how can you trust them otherwise
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-26 19:32:54	That was one long assed day. And it's not even over #fuckyoucalculus
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-28 00:02:06	I believe everything happens for a reason. It's just that sometimes the reason is not so easy to recognise
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-28 00:54:25	I'm a thirsty man. Let me drink you in 🎶
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-28 00:54:45	All I want is to be where you are
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-28 00:55:55	@rascalflatts I Won't Let Go ❤️😢
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-28 08:55:01	When ya worry about a particular thing happening, there's something not right there.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-28 08:56:29	I feel everything too deeply
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-28 09:00:15	When a complete stranger just gets it! Like, why aren't you in my life?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-02 18:56:25	Did a bit of damage to my account this weekend bit ah well. Was worth it
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-02 19:07:15	Felt like I was in work forever today. Even my manager said it to me. At least I got to creep on guys shopping 😉
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 13:14:13	Less than 24 hours in Westport but we made do many friends 😍😁🙋
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 14:06:19	If time is all I have, I'd waste it all on you
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 14:26:09	Iris is such an iconic song #sogood
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 14:28:36	You smile that smile
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 14:29:11	Hoping I don't get sick between now and Monday
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 14:33:08	I feel guilty for not recognising the bus driver. The amount of faces he must see every day and yet he remembered mine #sonice
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 14:38:09	Let's go to Tulsk
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 14:52:16	It seems you only want the things that you can't have
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 14:55:59	Tell me it's not just me
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 15:30:26	My biggest concern at the moment is not having enough time to go to the bathroom in Athlone before I get the bus to Maynooth
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 15:31:10	Galway next time?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 15:31:23	Achill with a group of really good friends would be class
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 15:32:02	And people wonder why I love it #beauty http://t.co/LGObg65zRn
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-28 10:10:27	I was right last night. I'm not in the mood for this
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-28 11:45:06	Only one more week and the knucklehead will be here 😜
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-28 12:15:36	When you're tying to take a sneaky photo but forget that the flash is on
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 22:53:37	I miss you so much. Your light, your smile, your ways.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 22:56:25	Already looking up places for another trip away 😜
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-01 23:28:23	Wanna change my name to the irish version on everything
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-02 12:18:48	You are one beautiful man.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-02-27 09:55:19	Make your destination my location 😉
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-03 00:28:53	Was so excited to donate blood tomorrow but have been advised not too #psshh
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-03 01:20:20	Some infinities are bigger than other infinities
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-03 02:49:30	Angry at that ending. I knew it was coming, but I'm still angry.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-03 02:52:27	Why do I just lie awake and think of you 💭
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-03 02:52:39	I do my best not to want you, but I do all the time.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-03 02:53:09	Ahhh need to sleep
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-03 14:58:12	I think my mam is finally coming round to the idea of a new car
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-03 23:13:49	Accidentally pinched my eye while trying to take my contact out. I never knew pain like that existed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-04 00:19:20	Just like a simple song, I can't get you out of my head
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-04 21:03:06	Possibly damaged the car again. F*ck sake
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-04 10:02:27	Playing the same playlist over and over, and skipping basically every song just to hear one particular song
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-04 10:02:53	Nails are so blue
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-04 12:07:43	I feel a surge coming over me
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-05 23:38:24	Just watched the fault in our stars trailer and I am gutted at who they cast as Hazel. Wouldn't even consider her #disappointed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-05 23:38:41	My life, ladies and gentlemen.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-06 08:32:59	Don't think my nine o'clock lecture is happening today #fail #ahwell #begrand
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-06 12:33:30	I need a new book. This whole doing actual work between lectures thing just isn't sitting well with me
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-06 01:12:41	Ashtrays and heartbreaks
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-08 04:28:04	Getting into bed after a long day 🙈👍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-08 04:30:36	I wish I had the energy to go meet the knucklehead at the airport #lovetheairport #KnuckleHeadishere  😊😍😁
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-06 13:05:17	I was okay with missing my lecture this morning. But now, I know that we had Kev. I would be lying if I said my heart wasn't broken
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-09 12:11:36	Is there any possibility that anybody feels like me?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-09 14:19:30	Having so much to do but not knowing where to start
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-08 13:49:39	I don't know how I'm going to manage next weekend #dying
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-08 14:05:05	George Hook's tie #funky
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-08 14:19:39	Work have rostered me in for an evening that they know I cannot do. Why do they do this?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-09 15:44:27	Everything is suddenly happening all at once. This will be one hectic week 😳😰
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-08 16:33:32	I look as tired as I feel. Work shall be oodles and noodles of fun.. 😒
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-07 10:42:44	300 photos last night. 300 photos were taken on my iPod. In one night.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-10 15:58:50	I hate the duck face. I don't understand why I did it so often the other night
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-12 23:35:33	6 o'clock tomorrow 😍

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-12 14:05:00	I think I have a crush on Oscar Wilde #whyyoudead
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-12 02:03:35	Some days you don't feel beautiful. Some days you wanna change it all.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-12 02:03:51	Once tomorrow is over, I shall be somewhat happy and relieved.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-12 02:04:58	I remember the day I was told about the engagement. I can't believe how fast those years went by.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-12 02:39:06	I do not have the energy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-12 02:39:40	Please stop. Just go away please
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-12 02:40:37	No matter how hard you kick, no matter how high you get, you can't go all the way around
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-16 22:54:53	What a weekend! Incredible ❤️ at the risk of sounding like a twat, I must say I am blessed. #alwayslookonthebrightsideoflife
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-18 13:36:29	No matter how many times I watch the video of the moment, I still cannot believe that I actually shook the hand of Zac Brown 😱🙈🙊 😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-17 14:01:34	Darby O'Gill and the little people 💚 #yes my day is made
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-17 16:11:27	The new twitter layout on the iPod annoys me immensely. I keep accidentally following random people or favoriting or retweeting things.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-17 16:16:43	Still can't believe I caught both of these😍 thank you @DierksBentley and the amazing violinist/guitarist #amazingshow http://t.co/ifn4PD4dVd

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-21 17:11:39	Sitting beside a lecturer who's correcting someone's work. I feel awkward.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-21 17:19:46	I don't know why but when i always remember Mullingar train station. It's the only one with a shelter. If I ever get lost, I'll know here

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-21 17:44:55	I prefer the blue grass version of Hey Brother
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-21 18:21:19	The train is unbelievably quiet now since the stag party got off. I miss them
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-22 11:09:53	Met a lad last night who was from Sligo and who also hated Dublin. Should've just married him right there and then 🙊
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-22 11:46:45	Words spoken. My heart open. No, I never had butterflies like that
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-22 15:52:49	Work. Ugh. I'd rather not #exhausted
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-21 15:40:31	@RebekahBowden I can't even deny it
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-21 16:40:28	I never expected the train to Sligo to be this busy. Dunno where to place myself
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-22 12:26:02	Pushin comes to shove, hey I'm a fighter ❤️
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-23 21:56:59	About time is such a fabulous movie

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-24 23:49:59	As if I needed an email of reminder. Daughtry in 6 days 😱😱😍🙊🇺🇸

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-25 10:38:00	When ya want to go playground on a sunny day, but ya have no one to go with, life is sad 😔

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-26 22:04:04	I'd love if people would just tell me straight out if I've done something wrong. Then it could be resolved. And we wouldn't have this shit
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-25 18:31:59	@RebekahBowden but you don't like getting phone calls 😳
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-25 19:27:37	I should write a book containing all the funny things Lucas says. Just laughing to myself here remembering all of them 😂😂 #cockpit #failure
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-25 19:28:20	If at first you don't succeed, failure might be your thing
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-25 21:21:50	You do not get with a friends ex or current 'crush'. "It's a rule amongst girls. It's small, but it's there."
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-25 21:22:31	When it's right, something always will go wrong

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-26 00:04:36	Picking a phone as a child was so easy. 'Is it pink?' Yes. 'I'll take it'. Simple
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-29 15:00:25	😱 Daughtry tomorrow 😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-26 22:07:57	What goes up, must come down

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-30 14:35:45	I just realised that the dress I wore to the wedding has pockets. Well, that would've been handy to know then
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-30 14:36:00	I'm literally obsessed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-30 14:36:39	As much as I adore their old stuff, I love Daughtry's new stuff #socatchy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-28 23:49:27	Regret telling my mam about the whole my head smacking the wall incident. Now she will worry forever
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-28 23:06:07	I just love toast
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-30 23:01:28	@Charming_Liars don't forget to follow us 😉 @RebekahBowden incredible show! Hope you enjoyed Dublin 🙋 http://t.co/LzJNZs7Fxq
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-30 23:36:18	@CHRIS_Daughtry Dublin adores you all 😍 please come back soon ☺️💜 #incredible
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-30 23:48:15	Cannot get over the fact that @DierksBentley favourited my tweet, I saw Daughtry live and got selfies with most of @Charming_Liars #amazing
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-30 23:48:38	Seriously, what a night ❤️🙊
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-31 09:28:44	My ears are still ringing
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-31 10:40:56	After a small game of 'Spot the culchies', we found the (actual) venue yesterday, thanks to a little help. Twas great craic getting home too
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-31 10:56:04	2 more weeks 😭☕️
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-31 14:59:07	You're worried half to death bout the things that just won't matter in the end
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-31 15:02:40	@CHRIS_Daughtry @elviofernandes Watching my videos of last night and wishing I could relive it! Please remember to come back soon ;) :)
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-03-31 22:07:35	Ya know how they say 'drunk words are sober thoughts'. If even sober you doesn't know what drunk you was on about, what does that make them?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-01 08:43:13	A few months ago, I didn't think it was possible to be any more tired than I was. Then, I got a job. #knackered24/7
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-01 16:22:56	Just casually taking the mattress off your bed and walking across campus with it so you can lie on it in the sun #youstayclassymaynooth 👍😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-03 09:19:39	Give me patience
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-03 11:45:37	People who can dish it out but can't take it 😒
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-03 11:45:54	Calculus. I'm fed up of you
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-01 22:55:00	@marko93101 they sold the rights to 14 games to sky sports, so they won't be shown on rte or tg4 anymore. Ya need sky to see then :(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-01 23:48:54	@marko93101 isn't it just! Frickin pissed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-01 23:52:26	Baptized is basically the soundtrack to my life at the moment. Cannot stop singing all of the songs 💜🙊
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-01 09:01:08	That's the thing about pain, it demands to be felt
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-01 10:58:03	Is there a bug going round? Or did I dream someone saying that? Either way, I think I have it 😷😖
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-04 15:11:57	Now you're letting your confusion take control. And leading you down a dark and lonely road
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-04 15:12:17	Even that won't last forever. Just look around and see you're not alone
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 10:25:41	If only this were true http://t.co/8Kex5UjavH
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 11:40:15	@islandgooner the one and only! would be epic if it was real :P
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-04 15:13:46	If you ain't finding love but you're still not giving up. Can you witness?
If you're down and up but you still wanna live it up ❤️
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-04 15:14:21	@CHRIS_Daughtry @elviofernandes Addicted to Witness 😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-04 16:21:38	Literally shaking because @elviofernandes tweeted me back. I'm such a fan girl. But I just adore him
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-03 14:51:38	@CelineHolloway1 we're always mysterious ;) out tonight? :)
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 17:22:01	Just not in the mood for anything
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-01 22:27:31	Gaa. You have got to be shittin me
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-01 22:55:29	@marko93101 and that's a problem for me cause I don't have sky :(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 21:40:37	I wish that I could make the road easy. I wish that life was fair
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 21:45:05	Having a job is great. Tis nice to have money. Would be even nicer if life wasn't so f*cking expensive #skintlads
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 21:45:42	Sure, we're only smashin' ❤️😉 @CelineHolloway1 http://t.co/sMg2ELyJSw
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 22:29:48	I've noticed a trend in my mood. Week of statistics assignment = happy. Week of calculus assignment = I hate everyone and everything.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 10:26:05	Love how there's a bit of James Kilbane thrown in there as well 😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-04 22:04:37	I'm scared
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-04 23:58:55	That should be me 😙😉
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-05 00:02:43	I wish there were more guys like you out there
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-05 00:04:39	I'm definitely in a much better mood now that my calculus assignment is done for the week
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-05 00:10:49	As much as we deny it, every girl gets jealous when someone's flirting with a guy you like
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-05 00:11:09	We're never satisfied
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-05 00:12:59	Sleep. Right now. Amazing #nightnight 🌜😴
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 18:34:27	"Ugh, I wish my daddy could buy him for me" - Jackie 👍👏🙈🙊😜
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 21:37:29	I had one person who I trusted and who helped me through anything. She's gone now but I've no doubt she's still helping me ❤️💚😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 21:45:59	@BabyClarke I miss you missus :(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 22:28:21	@BabyClarke nope, why? Are you? :o :o
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 23:01:44	@BabyClarke ah Kate! Ya kept that fairly quiet ;) ah I'll definitely consider it now :D will definitely go for pre's though if there are any
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 23:03:01	What a beautiful ending too my day. The dog lost control of her excretion, yet again, and I had to clean it 😖😷
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 23:03:28	Then I was all warm and comfy in bed when I realised that I still have my contacts in. #shootmenow
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-02 23:04:16	On a brighter note though, I found money from the wedding which I'd thought I'd spent #yaaay
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-05 22:49:53	Looking through old photos and found this. The only bit of seaweed i will ever find cute http://t.co/f0l11d8YMr

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-06 00:21:45	Let me drown in ya honey
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-06 00:22:13	This is me all over. I gotta stop http://t.co/7Vlbu6I61W
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-06 00:30:32	Eyebrows that are drawn on are freaky and kinda disgusting #stoptheplucking
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-06 00:36:16	Friends like Sean ☺️
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-06 21:46:40	I'm allergic to 4 of the 15 ingredients of this Naked drink. What am I?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-06 00:48:14	Oh isn't it strange how a life can changed in a flicker of the sweetest smile
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-06 01:29:51	Need/Want to go to Achill again soon

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-08 19:42:01	@RebekahBowden god, I'm torn apart in siiide
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-08 22:23:42	Snapchats with Sean always turn out dirty 😂😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-08 22:26:12	Snapchat is ruling the world right now. And ruining my work ethic. This is what happens when I have no credit.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-08 11:07:13	I text Jerry. He's strange.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-07 10:07:52	@Stephen_Fay exactly. But seriously, who puts garlic into a juice drink?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-07 11:38:08	Pretty much http://t.co/xsFkjdQxTT

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-12 23:36:40	When I fall, I fall hard
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-12 23:36:53	And sometimes, I don't realise I've even fallen
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-13 00:10:08	I just can't explain it so others won't fully understand it
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-13 00:13:34	I'm in so much trouble
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-13 00:14:26	Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth 👏

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-13 22:14:12	I think my family are finally beginning to understand that I'm exhausted and stressed all the time cause I've a lot going on
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-13 22:44:14	I wish it was J1 time already. Need to get away
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-13 23:00:31	Earlier I really wanted popcorn but didn't have any
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-13 23:01:25	And now, I'm lying in bed wishing I was asleep but wishing more that I'd had that popcorn
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-11 15:40:17	I seem to be a mean drunk. I don't like it. That shits gotta stop

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-15 11:51:27	Why am I always so tired
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-15 20:46:17	It was only a smile, but my heart it went wild. And I wasn't expecting that 🙊👍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-12 11:15:36	Apparently my hand looks badly bruised 😂 could be a lot worse
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-16 09:51:29	The first two weeks of this semester were golden weeks. I have this Friday off and I'm not even bothered about getting a golden week
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-16 09:52:09	My dog is more important
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-16 11:35:34	My knee is magically better 😄 it's still a little sore but I no longer have a limp
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-15 19:59:12	Or just swimming. Would love to go swimming
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-17 10:00:26	If I could just hop into bed and sleep til Monday, my life would be sorted
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-17 22:33:01	Baby, I've been losing sleep. Dreaming about the things that we could be
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-18 13:31:52	There is a very, very high possibility that I will regret sending those snapchats last night
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-18 13:32:49	Good Friday dinners are the worst dinners of the year. Just the smell is making me gag 😖
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-18 13:34:43	Us girls are so confusing. Even I don't understand us.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-20 17:59:47	Not Zoe and Joel 💔😢😢

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-20 03:17:47	To the loud f*ckers who frightened my dog and woke up my whole family at this hour, I don't know who you are, but you're all dead to me 😠😒
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-20 03:18:12	There's only so much ya can take before ya really just don't give a shit anymore
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-22 19:56:31	So many midgies out this evening
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-20 23:27:14	My mam is off to Achill tomorrow and she won't bring me. I consider that child abuse
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-20 23:27:31	Ibuprofen has been my best friend these last few days
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-22 23:58:44	The movie of The Book Thief did the book justice. The book is always better though

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-22 08:52:40	The greatest think you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-22 08:52:46	We have to laugh at the stuff that makes us human 👍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-22 08:53:28	My dreams last night caused me nothing but stress
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-22 12:01:06	I dunno how people can text/talk to each other all the time. I get fed up of people far too quickly 😕😛
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-21 14:46:25	@ikcivanderson @RebekahBowden nope, I couldn't 😧 it's just.. Well, it's complicated
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-04-21 14:47:58	My inability to nap has a profound effect on my life

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-02 17:21:19	This time two weeks, I will be crying over my failure of a first exam and stressing over how equally atrocious the others will be
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-02 17:23:35	Why has it taken me til the last week to realise just how much work I actually needed to do this year? #fail #hellorepeatsorsecondyearagain

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-01 09:12:27	@marko93101 yeah, why is that? Was not happy when I checked my account
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-01 09:14:09	A comparison between where I am and where I wanna be 😔 just yet another reason http://t.co/RomlYx5Wlz

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-02 21:17:57	Like a moth into a flame. I'm hypnotized, I'm like a stone, I'm paralyzed cause I can't look away
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-02 21:19:09	How am I supposed to break this spell you got me under? I'm so addicted to the pain #loveit
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-02 21:20:33	@CHRIS_Daughtry At the risk of sounding creepy, I don't think you'll ever understand just how much I adore you and your music &lt;3
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-05 14:32:25	I think I'm the only person who didn't go out at all this weekend #dedicatedstudent #hahaijoke #ijustslept #allthetime

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-12 10:22:15	At this stage, its not even procrastination. Its just laziness #examtime
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-10 21:01:07	Yup, I heard right :D @cwhartofdixie used Gilmartin for one of the character names &lt;3 #yaaay #loveHoD
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-14 10:32:51	Went to bed last night full sure that it was Monday. Can't believe it's Wednesday already 😳
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-14 12:28:34	I'm still bewildered by the fact that I'm doing study for an exam, prior to the night before. Shit just got real
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-14 20:58:50	Decided to go out for a nice walk, clear the head. Ended up heading out when the whole parish was out
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-16 09:53:20	I think I'm the most relaxed student right now #whatexams
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-16 21:17:57	I seem to have no luck on my walks lately. Was chased by two bats tonight. Twas terrifying
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-16 10:05:05	Told my mam that I might stay on in college after my exam, meaning to study..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-16 10:06:41	Her response: Okay, but if ya have a drink, just give us a call and we'll pick up the car.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-18 17:17:07	Ahh, the library is so boring
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-15 18:57:53	'The only thing I'm gaining from this study is weight.' Never has a truer statement been made #examwoes
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-16 10:07:15	I feel like I should apologise for not being the alco she thinks I am.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-17 15:08:52	2 missed calls and probably both from work. Whoops. I ain't able to work anymore hours than I'm rostered though #sorryimnotsorry #examtime
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-19 10:20:14	It seems the world doesn't want me to study and do well in biomed tomorrow. Not getting anything done 😭😫
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-19 10:20:58	For the first time during these exams, stress has me on the verge of tears. And I've only done one exam so far
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-19 10:21:26	Fudge you work, people, universe
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-19 10:34:19	@Young___Wolf I had to rant somewhere 😋 my dads working from home today, for some strange and annoying reason, and his phone has not stopped
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-19 10:35:45	@Young___Wolf and he has it on speaker so wherever I go in the house, I can hear him.. I just need silence :L  sorry, I'll stop complaining
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-19 21:33:50	I'm just not built for late nights 😴
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-19 23:37:29	Looking up how pregnancy tests work for biomed. If my parents walked in now, God only knows what they'd think #nunnery
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-20 19:09:20	Gonna treat myself after the day I've had and put myself out of my misery. Hart of Dixie. Season Finale. I can already feel the tears
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-20 20:29:59	Unexpected.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-21 14:27:45	If I wasn't in work this evening, id have anyone and everyone over for a BBQ #glooorious
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-20 17:09:30	I'm not gonna lie, part of me wishes I was going to see Miley Cyrus tonight
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-21 12:03:45	Thought I'd left all my maths notes at home yesterday so study for maths didn't go well. Turns out they were in the car the whole time 😩😅💩
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-21 14:28:18	And that way, I'd also have someone to play on the trampoline with me #jumpingalone
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-21 23:03:49	Finally listening to Chris and Ciara after months of deprivation. My life is once again whole.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-22 10:13:06	@RebekahBowden sure that's only petty change. Could get them for Monday, just for the craic, and then Thursday too. Plan?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-22 11:55:28	Just been watching Frenchy for the last hour. Time well spent
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-24 09:35:17	I just want it to be 2 o'clock already
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-24 14:12:31	Calulus 4. Train wreck. No survivors. Memorial service in August.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-22 16:52:53	It's only hitting me now what I've given up this summer by giving up the job in Achill 💔😢 #fudge my heart is broken. #nodreamcometrue
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-24 14:35:52	Can I go back? Yeah, cool http://t.co/K7GwOWZbwC
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-23 17:23:58	Only realised when the woman had everything scanned that I actually didn't have my card. Being nice and feeling guilty, I offered to put
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-23 17:26:03	Everything back. It was only after that I realised how weird that must've sounded to her. I wouldn't rob anything. I swear. Whoops 😳😅
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-23 18:04:14	@theBrandiCyrus is so gorgeous it hurts 😍 #girlcrush
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-23 20:30:59	I'm having far too much fun with snapchat. Obscene procrastination
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-25 15:17:18	@Young___Wolf OMFG No way! Even with your hint, i did not cop that. Frozen theme would be amazing! &lt;3
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-25 15:30:10	@Young___Wolf oh nooo! Not elsa :( shes just misunderstood, not evil.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-25 15:35:01	@Young___Wolf haha thanks bobby, but its not all that easy when all my lecture notes are on my laptop :p
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-25 21:49:07	@RebekahBowden I'll show you. I'm quite the experienced folder now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-25 21:56:30	@RebekahBowden hey now! I tried the toilet roll thing before and you got too impatient and ducked it up. That's a lost cause
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-25 22:03:25	@RebekahBowden yes. You were. Very much. But still
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-26 03:20:07	You know it's time for sleep when it's starting to get bright outside and you can hear the birds tweeting.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-26 06:52:37	You'll always be a part of the most treasured memories I hold in my heart ❤️
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-26 06:54:39	So ready for today! Everything covered, great nights sleep, couldn't be more relaxed. #sarcasm
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-05-26 02:03:30	I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you.

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-04 12:51:15	Accidentally dropped my iPod on collarbone. Oh, the pain
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-04 13:19:33	Found my new favourite band. But I'm gonna be selfish and keep them to myself 😜😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-04 16:48:35	I just had to laugh 😂😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-04 23:14:02	@marko93101 :o I hope so. Most likely won't now that I've said that :(

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-17 14:49:17	Oh, how I wish I was in Dooagh right now ⛅️🌊😳😍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-17 15:22:21	Right now, I am the definition of 'don't underestimate irish sun' #sunburngalore
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-18 20:55:48	So, it turns out my efforts at being sun safe failed because the suncream was gone off #whoknew I look like a barber pole
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-21 13:28:28	I think im the only person who doesnt understand this whole perfect mug shot guy thing. I dont see it.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-21 13:29:26	Hate being in work when i know my little mites are in bad shape :(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-21 14:01:42	@Young___Wolf he has the classic drug dealer look, i just dont get it
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-21 19:24:04	My heart is breaking. This is why I would never do well in an animal rescue service :'(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-23 23:12:32	Haven't the slightest notion what I did with my contacts the other night 😳
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-22 16:59:25	Paul Rudd, you legend &lt;3
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-22 17:03:31	@RebekahBowden @ikcivanderson Oh no, I'm the husband. That's very different. I'm a 1.75 on a good day. Should've traded up Beka
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-22 17:04:30	Oh the decisions that have to be made #roadtrip #summergettogethers #yay #hashtag

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-22 19:09:41	@RebekahBowden @ikcivanderson All in a days work. After my 'howdy doody' incident, I'd doubt that hello was my first word to you :P
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-22 19:14:19	Plans, plans galore. But Time, so little of it
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-22 19:15:19	@RebekahBowden @ikcivanderson yes, all downhill. as is evident in every day life now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-23 11:47:04	Playing nanny for the beautiful mites today 🐱🍼
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-26 13:29:51	I think I passed @BrianMLloyd in Maynooth today. I was gonna stop him but then I thought that might be a bit weird.. #stalkerish

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-26 21:39:28	Sitting in the middle of bradys, incredibly tempted to check my results. The drink is there for comfort..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-25 11:52:47	Tried to run but I keep on coming back, full circle
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-06-25 13:03:57	Pathetic fallocy

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-01 13:17:25	Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like if I hadn't discovered all these random and amazing bands 🎶🎵❤️
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-04 22:31:07	Daydreaming.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-05 12:25:59	In the wars these last few days
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-07 14:12:21	@John__Mee That is absolutely stunning!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-08 14:47:00	What happens matters. Maybe only to us, but it matters.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-08 15:41:38	I've listened to nothing but the music of three particular artists for the last week. I've yet to grow sick of them

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-14 13:34:01	It's no ones fault. I'm just too young, and you're insane.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-14 13:37:27	Why does living have to be so expensive
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-16 11:56:36	You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-16 11:58:22	Times clash, I realise that. But when they don't, you're just a dick #justsayin 😜
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-16 11:59:52	Little bits of blue shining through 😊
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-16 12:00:48	I'd be the first to admit that my iPod has the weirdest combination of songs, but I wouldn't have it any other way 😁😁
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-16 12:44:38	Somehow through it all I stand still undefeated.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-16 12:02:18	I'm such a hypocrite. But so is everyone else
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-16 13:46:51	I have this entire weekend off and all the plans I had made have fallen through. I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself #sadtimes
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-16 12:41:19	Just had a fox pottering around outside my window. Most exciting moment of my day :L
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-16 13:28:13	Now I live with the regret that my true feelings for them never were revealed.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-16 18:56:03	When your younger brother has a much better social life than you, ya know things need to change 😳
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-16 22:37:03	Panic is starting to set in now. I can't possibly be going into third year already.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-17 20:14:02	Became a demon at 9, fighting anyone who stopped me watching TG4
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-17 20:28:38	Actually asked my brother could I hang out with him and his friends cause my friends are all busy/boring.. :P

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-20 12:11:45	5th wheeling with my brothers friends, so awkward #atleastimolder
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-20 12:20:46	The music in here is perfect #caledonia #Mytypeofplace
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-20 14:48:47	Theres sportsmanship and then theres just plain rude
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-21 17:01:59	There is a very good chance that I'm actually still tipsy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-21 17:50:58	Reminiscing
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-21 23:34:12	I am truly shocked. I did not see that coming #lonewolf #amazing
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-21 23:35:28	The best friends are the ones that you can go weeks/months without seeing or speaking to. And yet when you meet, nothing's changed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-21 23:36:45	There are so many things I would love to tweet about but, no. 😋
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-21 23:50:05	Ya never miss what ya have til it's gone
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-21 23:50:16	Lyric spree
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-21 23:51:31	Shiny happy people 🎶
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-22 00:04:03	I shouldn't be this stressed out at 20 years of age 😳 I'm gonna be one of those people who looks 10 years older than they actually are 😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-22 00:05:49	Let it go, let it go 😉🎶
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-22 00:07:36	My twelve year old cousin said something to me the other day that really shocked and amazed me. 'Don't be afraid to change.' That boy ❤️
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-22 00:08:33	Wow, I'm that annoying tweeter who tweets everything and fills up your timeline. I apologise. I'm done now 😁
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-22 16:23:55	Do ya ever feel that you're missing a part of yourself when ya finish a book?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-29 14:07:47	Deleting twitter and facebook off of my iPod was probably the best decision I've ever made #liberating
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-29 15:06:24	Only just realised that I haven't seen my phone since last night. And, of course, it's on silent #ahwell
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-07-30 12:58:06	Land of Opportunity says it all :D
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-01 11:35:05	I think I will soon develop a gambling problem #galwayraces #shteam
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-01 11:48:06	I can already tell that this weekend will be a killer. My feet are about to fall off
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-04 19:28:52	Long working weekend, done. #Wrecked

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-04 23:44:11	Good things only come with time http://t.co/XHKkM3w6se
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-06 17:40:44	@AoifeGilmartin if we were both in Tubber, we'd probably never run into each other #crazy #greattoseeyabill ;) &lt;3
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-06 22:24:47	I have waited so long to see @joshuaradin live and now that i have, i can safely say that he exceeded all of my expectations. I'm in love &lt;3
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-06 23:39:43	"@rosigolan: Dublin, you are the sweetest. I can't wait to see you again. Dates will be posted soon xo" @K_S_Lazari we must go :D #amazing
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-05 14:21:24	I need somewhere I can go. Underwater is where I'll go
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-05 16:50:55	My brother goes to hand out cvs and an hour later, he already has a weeks work experience #crazy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-07 22:39:10	The best thing I can give to you, is for me to go. Leave you alone, cause you got growin' up to do
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-10 13:18:19	Trying to organize a short trip away, with specific dates and minimal funds. This is tough. Never mind finding someone to go with :o #stress
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-14 18:09:27	7 hours of travelling and im finally home. That was like Achill take 2
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-16 20:39:46	@ConorNerney DO SOME STUDY
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-18 16:41:58	@marko93101 this, saddens me :( &lt;/3
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-18 16:44:27	12 hours.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-16 20:41:27	Just two more days
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-18 23:36:48	@marko93101 too late now
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-19 05:09:12	Its a long time since I last saw this side of the morning
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-21 18:05:55	Unbelievable happiness http://t.co/5LOH1IQFXM
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-23 11:23:47	Today, I resent the fact that I have a job
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-31 13:57:15	Granted the amount is minimal, but last night was one of the best nights I've ever had in town 🙊😉🎶
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-31 16:08:21	Great day! So happy to see Donegal win. Unbelievably happy 😁 I can't explain it. Fair play McHugh #manofthematch
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-31 16:17:29	Lads, stop trying to find excuses for ye losing. The ref was fair. Dublin did not play a good game. Face it #bubye #seeyoulater
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-31 16:19:24	Kerry and Donegal in the minor and senior finals. What a coincidence 😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-08-31 16:20:42	I love my kittens 😍🐱 so cute
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-03 08:54:30	Witness 👍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-03 11:59:49	Stranded in Blanch. I think this will finally convince my parents to sell this heap of sh*te
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-05 06:42:28	@K_S_Lazari aw, I just realised I won't see ya before ya head off again 😞 I'll text ya 😉 #sleeptight
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-05 06:43:32	I dream of seeing Dan and Shay live 😍 #someday
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-05 06:54:30	The ticket inspector said I was welcome to sleep on the train if I'd like. I must actually look as tired as I feel 😴 #stillnosleepy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-05 09:38:25	Don't think I'm gonna make the early bus 😫 7 hours in Westport.. What to do?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-05 09:50:37	@islandgooner I think I may have to! I just left Castlebar. Never even thought to go there. All I can do now is hope my bus is there 😝
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-05 10:01:50	@islandgooner Achill, hoping to get the summer service bus
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-05 10:45:24	Got the bus 👍 and as a result, I am currently on a tour of Achill. I can't think of a better way to spend my time
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-05 00:39:15	@K_S_Lazari you are home, yes?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-05 16:24:31	@islandgooner made the bus and got a lovely tour of achill! haha if i hadnt, id still be in westport right now. I cant imagine it
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-05 16:26:13	Its hard to complain with the view i have right now #drizzlybutwonderful
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-07 09:44:38	F*ck me. I've never been that bad. And I've never felt this horrible about it. What does Achill so to me 😔😩😳😣
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-05 20:21:16	I wish I had the energy to go out. But I don't.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-07 11:17:33	Now I'm off to try and find my blazer. And my dignity.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-07 13:23:41	As mortifyingly embarrassed as I am regarding last nights events, I would much rather not go home.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-08 08:59:01	This time yesterday, I was just chillin' right here. Loving life. My view now doesn't bring me half as much joy http://t.co/G9gXH0YYI2
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-10 16:46:28	Days like this make me miss having a beach within walking distance #glorious
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-09 15:39:36	The amount of responsibility ya get after getting your full licence is soul destroying
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-11 12:37:58	College registration. You have one this round. #soconfused
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-12 15:37:31	Going out after work is such a pain #effort
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-15 13:55:26	Shades on spinnin' in the summer rain 😎❤️
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-13 11:43:32	The day after, ugh 😴😓
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-14 18:29:49	I know I should be flattered, but I actually get really annoyed when someone copies me
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-14 18:36:08	I've been sick the last few days , but I can't figure out why 😒
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-16 16:56:49	I hope last night wasn't an indication of what this year will be like #soold

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-18 10:25:52	@Klaz393 why do you do this to me? I just got used to the old one 😫😋
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-20 12:12:19	Getting really annoyed that I can't shift this cold 😭
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-17 23:34:23	Forever 21, you are dangerous to my bank account #splurge
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-17 23:36:13	Lately, all my money has been spent in town. I can't explain it

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-28 10:02:44	Country roads, take me home, to the place I belong
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-24 18:22:25	Writing a birthday card for a best friend is harder than writing an essay for college
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-30 08:16:30	Kettle calling the pot black
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-30 16:18:49	I'm pretty sure that's just a man in a suit
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-29 22:54:50	I gotta start wearing more clothes. I don't like having a cold
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-28 21:05:59	Ah, I wanna go back to about a month ago
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-28 22:03:14	A trip to see Tubber win the final would be lovely 😉 #HonTubber

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-02 23:00:12	Is it possible to get high on Olbas oil? Cause I may very well be
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-09-29 09:31:13	@gilmartinm12 you'll be there in spirit :) I'll most likely be working so I won't actually be able to go :( #raging
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-02 09:52:43	@sgcpw25 stop following me..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-02 09:53:36	Lost my phone somewhere between my house and my lecture room. We weren't even a year together
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-01 19:38:04	Just one day would be nice
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-02 14:38:11	Is buying bottles of water now cheaper than getting it from the tap?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-01 22:10:38	@KaceyMusgraves knows what it's about #FollowYourArrow 💚
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-02 20:44:36	I'd much rather be out tonight
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-03 23:33:30	I feel accomplished
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-03 23:34:08	I better be better by Monday 😳😫
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-03 23:42:40	Don't wanna go to work tomorrow. I feel like I've been away for weeks. It has been 4 days after all
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-07 14:29:11	I haven't got the energy to go back to college
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-06 08:21:10	I last charged my phone on Friday, and granted I haven't used it much, it's still on 42% #success

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-07 22:01:56	All I wanted was Sunday off, just that one day 😔😫
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-08 10:28:46	I've been in the library a whole 10 mins and so far, I've opened my laptop, changed my playlist, snapchatted and text someone. #productive
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-08 11:39:56	This library idea was bad.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-08 13:36:11	It's my right to be hellish. I still get jealous
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-09 12:17:48	Still don't know what dissertation title I want #indecisiveashell
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-09 15:32:24	Being everyone's taxi driver and not a word of thanks. I just get called a fucker 😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-09 15:34:56	Choosing what to have for dinner is such a hard decision
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-10 07:31:10	I have an obsession with the ocean
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-09 18:17:21	Now that I know what topic I want, what are the bets that I won't get any of them
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-09 18:34:01	I'd prefer London
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-09 18:34:22	And then, New York would be nice
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-09 18:35:11	But then if it came to Sligo vs Mayo, I'd be torn 💔🙈
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-09 18:45:51	Here it comes #leinstergaa #tense

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-11 07:22:46	Can't hack the sessions anymore
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-11 08:26:17	I will make it to Coppers, some day..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-11 13:35:04	I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-12 11:04:28	Got absolutely stared out of it by a 3 yr old Miley wannabe at mass today #creepy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-12 11:11:58	Sporting my black and white wooly jumper for the day that's in it #hontubber
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-12 11:22:12	Best of luck to the Tubber lads today! Raging I can't be there
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-12 13:15:50	I love the fact that the Harley's acknowledged that What About Now was not actually Westlifes song #Daughtry #needstobesaid
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-12 23:07:40	Getting real sick of these evening shifts in work now #fo
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-14 10:45:52	In the library, again. This is not like me.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-14 10:46:45	@niamhmimnagh I feel we should be wearing jumpers that say 'New Year, New Me'

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-20 21:44:24	Some people are so depressing 😓
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-20 22:01:05	Trying to get the money to afford my summer adventures, and it ain't going well #broke
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-21 22:23:31	Just remembered that I placed an order with Azzuri about 6 months ago and I still haven't received it #opps #dfuck 😱

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-23 20:00:38	@marko93101 it wasn't really. Don't even know how it happened. Getting real annoying now though
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-23 20:02:46	@Farrell03 oh yeah, very sorry about that. Words have been had, don't worry. Won't happen again
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-24 11:07:15	@marko93101 I wasn't shouting. I do recall singing though. I can only apologise for that now. What's done is done..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-24 14:48:19	Sent 20 larvae to their death and killed another one in the process. #rip
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-24 15:02:30	Voice is getting back to normal, at last
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-26 19:54:10	I was so upset bout not getting lunch today and excited about having a good dinner. The disappointment I feel regarding food today is unreal
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-26 22:28:09	https://t.co/aVh8arCysF I forgot how much I love this song
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-26 22:48:40	Trying to book my Spring week off but the website ain't having it #notimpressed
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-25 09:10:32	Throat is killing me. So tempted to call in sick. 😣 #soldieron
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-28 15:55:23	Got my voice back 😄 this is a very good day
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-28 16:18:01	Hard to breathe, feels like floating.
So full of love, my hearts exploding.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-28 17:33:56	Started singing Let It Go to my dog, and now my voice is gone again. Disney songs have cursed me #Ursulaisatwork
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-27 22:50:38	Sometimes when I'm the sober one, I seem more drunk than everyone else
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-30 21:34:20	They expect us to dress up for work tomorrow.. Ehh #no
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-01 16:10:57	Just realized how soon the dissertation has to be submitted 😳 #stop
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-01 16:11:44	And yet, that doesn't encourage me to do any of it today. So lazy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-01 16:25:29	Those days when foundation actually goes on well 👏
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-10-31 16:22:33	@GlenCampbell bringing it all out #ImNotGonnaMissYou 😢❤️

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-03 13:25:46	@Klaz393 I refuse to go any further into the centre than penneys. I will not let them ruin this Christmas for me too 😠😫 enjoy work btw 😜
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-03 14:11:27	I didn't think it was possible, but it's actually colder inside my house than it is outside
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-04 09:45:55	Who's the idiot who put all her assignments on a memory stick, that she then lost, but then found once again 🙋
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-05 13:58:16	I haven't saved a penny in the last 6 weeks. In fact, I think I've spent more than I've earned in that time #hopeless #collegeisexpensive
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-04 19:17:24	One more day 😄😁
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-04 19:28:22	My car did the whole cut out thing again in the middle of a roundabout today 😒 #baaah
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-05 09:28:10	Well, that was awkward 😳 At least it was the most awkward thing that could happen to me today
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-07 12:20:52	I need to go away soon #roadtrip

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-06 19:03:28	Roost or town? Out or not? All theses decisions and my lack of decisiveness are not a good mix
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-06 21:17:31	I wanna shower you with sugar lumps
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-11 23:58:21	Had such good intentions to do work this evening, but I ended up having a mini snapchat fashion show instead #productive 😋
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-11 11:41:36	Actually excited about doing this assignment and dissertation. What is wrong with me? #swot

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-19 21:40:22	@IISuperwomanII 'My pantaloons are descending. Where art thou?' I think I pee'd slightly when I saw this 😂😂 #Brilliant #TypesOfCrushes
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-11-19 22:31:53	Throat has closed up somewhat. Finding it hard to swallow. Chocked on coffee. #ahwell #begrand #mylifeissointeresting

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-12-02 19:01:31	It's amazing how fast six years can pass
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-12-03 11:55:23	Had a dream last night about going out in Maynooth. Safe to say I miss it
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-12-04 13:14:41	When the library feels like a second home, ya know you've become something ya never thought you'd ever be. A good student.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-12-04 13:55:10	Someone around me smells of fish and tobacco. I may just vomit
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-12-04 15:34:09	Uptown funk on repeat 👍
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-12-04 18:35:37	I know I'll be there Saturday, but a huge part of me wants to go Roost tonight. I miss it, too much 😂😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-12-04 23:54:41	Fierce hormonal lately. Cried when I saw the Kellogg's Christmas ad and the video of the pup singing to Let It Go #sendhelp

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-12-10 20:09:35	@Klaz393 when your weekends no longer exist due to work commitments, Monday's are a gift #sadlifeilead
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-12-11 13:36:18	@Klaz393 this is slowly killing me. Trying to condense this down is actually worse than writing it in the first place #struggling #sendhelp
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-12-10 16:49:01	Nearly 1500 words in and it still feel like I've no relevant information in this

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-12-10 18:36:26	Monday cannot come quick enough
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-12-10 11:51:17	Stay in and go library, or go home? #thatisthequestion
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-12-11 02:00:08	I didn't realize, but I actually had over 1,800 words done before I left college. I am now well over the limit and not yet finished #fudge
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-12-11 20:47:07	Stood up, fell over, can't get up

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2014-12-28 10:45:53	Living was living.
The price was guilt and shame.

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-03 15:01:13	Tempted to call in sick to work. Feeling absolutely rotten
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-03 15:13:29	Eating tomatoes is not worth this pain #migrane #aching
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-03 15:39:14	I regret not doing that #fudge
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-07 15:05:52	I never thought I'd say this but, if the salmon question doesn't appear on the Friday exam, I will cry
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-08 16:19:37	I am about to be disowned
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-09 15:01:09	I'm scared. That's what's happening.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-09 15:02:45	I'm like that 1/100 antelope that I rambled about in my exam. I'm the 1 in 100 that will be eaten.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-09 15:45:11	Just got caught, by my neighbour, going all out to 'New York, New York' #jazzhands #cancan #gottalovefranksinatra
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-10 15:33:29	In the mood for a McFlurry or something now #studycravings
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-10 17:24:47	This day just keeps getting better and better 😁 (except for that one thing 😔)
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-09 20:30:03	I have done the bare minimum for tomorrow, and yet I'm still procrastinating
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-10 20:31:49	Does exam time make anyone else lose track of the days?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-11 14:05:35	They don't make music like they used to
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-11 21:42:51	Day 3. Still no bread in the house.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-14 11:54:36	@Klaz393 no, why?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-14 12:04:43	If anyone finds my motivation to study, I'd really appreciate getting it back. Thanks
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-14 15:13:44	Feeling slightly proud that the waiter knew I was the pornstar #noshame
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-14 21:28:45	It's always when you can't have something that you want it most. No, I'm not trying to be deep. I'm just fasting. #PrayForCiara
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-14 21:34:49	Unnecessarily nervous
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-15 14:58:52	Everything hurts
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-15 21:02:16	Today was rough
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-15 21:32:20	@Klaz393 ahhh okay. i'll look into him at some stage
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-15 23:32:50	Will I get brownie points for accidentally writing something quite suggestive in an exam? #PMF #getitright
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-19 00:45:03	I should just stop talking to my mother from now on. It's proving dangerous
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-17 14:14:23	I didn't realise my ecology notes would be so valuable until I lost my notes copy #typical
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-17 15:23:42	Snapchat is dangerous in a library. I'm just sitting here smiling and giggling to myself. I am normal
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-17 17:49:03	Go town tonight or be fresh for tomorrow? hmm, we shall see where the night takes me
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-18 19:02:02	@Klaz393 Focusing on exams before I look into any of that. What's going on with you? What has you so stressed?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-17 15:35:27	@Stephen_Fay you're just jealous
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-18 20:10:22	@Klaz393 thats hopeless. cant get it both ways haha
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-19 11:24:13	@Stephen_Fay ya know what

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-20 00:00:37	Just took a 'What song should be played at your funeral' quiz. Procrastination = dangerous level
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-18 22:32:32	My mam is being ridiculous
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-20 21:23:17	2pm tomorrow = Freedom
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-20 15:10:35	Still incredibly pissed about that. From now on. work is not one of my main priorities
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-23 16:13:05	I preferred when I was still drunk. This hangover craic is shockin
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-23 12:21:19	Ive been avoiding mirrors all day, and ive been right to. Apologies to the general public.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-23 23:15:40	Ah now, this is getting a tad bit weird 😳😕

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-24 12:18:48	Recent studies have proven that sleeping reduces fatigue.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-25 21:50:07	I've been waiting all day to get food, and now that I finally have, I'm dissatisfied. #ew feel so sickly
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-26 17:07:29	Nothing went into the fishbowl for the entire game. Did we fail at Kings @TaaraHenry @CelineHolloway1? #aces 😂😂 http://t.co/mt4QqDaIui

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-28 16:01:45	Garda station opening hours are so inconvenient
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-28 20:51:16	A simple doctors visit has now turned into numerous hospital visits, tests, more problems and the loss of loadsa dolla bills 😭😒😂 #dayum
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-28 20:55:57	Fr. Dougal McGuire was one of the best characters ever created 😂

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-30 17:02:47	It's the weight that you carry for the things you think you want 🎶
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-29 07:07:02	It feels like a crime getting up this early on a day off
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-01-29 09:06:02	I love travelling, even its only a short journey. Just thought I'd inform you all.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-01 22:11:37	Decided to do a stereotypical girly thing and wear a face mask. Of course this is the time that my cousin surprise FaceTimes me #shockin
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-01 22:16:21	At least he and his mam have now seen my extremely red face. They're gonna be seeing a lot more of it this summer anyway
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-03 14:53:32	Well today was a complete and utter fail.  Next Tuesday will be better

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-04 17:34:13	Mam left the door open so the kitchen now smells of slurry 😖
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-04 17:35:57	Oh wait, nope. Now she's sprayed something that smells nice, but there's so much of it that I feel slightly high..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-05 19:18:57	Don't think I'm physically able for going out tonight 😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-05 19:19:31	Sat on the cold ground for a good hour last night just chatting. We're so clever
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-06 18:56:37	Well, that's embarrassing 😳😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-07 17:30:42	I don't understand why I've a car when I'm only allowed to drive within a 15 mile radius of the house
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-07 17:52:50	Can I get an amen?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-07 18:05:59	It's all just a bitta fun 😉👍 #whysoserious
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-07 18:14:23	Asked my dad to take a picture on my iPod yesterday. He took 80, and most of them are the same #sheakybastard 😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-06 11:28:32	How was my night? Dad found my phone in the fridge and this.. 🙈😂😂 http://t.co/TCbg4pklWp
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-08 12:32:09	I'm amazed at how fresh I feel today. Wine mustn't have the same effect on me now, following this Christmas
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-08 12:44:31	Lay on the ground with @CelineHolloway1 singing Love Me Like You Do #truelove #justcause 😂
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-08 12:45:28	Had to delete and rewrite a tweet cause I mentioned the wrong person. The struggle is real lads

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-09 19:18:24	Now I've got people asking me to go out and I'm no longer in the mood #dilemma
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-08 20:45:17	While protecting myself from the cold with my scarf, I may have eaten some of it 😳 I feel like I've a ball of fluff sitting in my throat..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-12 14:30:39	@erbekah I'm full sure that was taken severely out of context 😂 but hey now!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-12 14:35:52	Hey! It's my friends! I'm sorry I bit you. And pulled your hair. And punched you in the face.

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-15 17:30:00	Told mam I couldn't have a drink cause I was driving to maynooth, and she immediately assumed I was heading out.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-15 17:32:48	I think she's forgotten that I go to college there, and that there's shops there too #mymamthinksimanalco

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-02-22 23:24:42	@ikcivanderson I think we could get very rich from this idea. Not that nuns need money or anything.. we could donate it all

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-15 15:56:37	It's crazy how well I remember being in the Maynooth St. Patricks day parade. Wearing gold and white, Thinking Mary-Louise was a goddess
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-15 15:59:04	It's understandable though, cause she was #girlcrush
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-26 16:31:21	@TheCoronas How This Goes &lt;3 A song that makes ya stop whatever you're doing, and perform #tune
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-27 12:09:27	@ikcivanderson i saw you. But you didnt see me. I was sad :(
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-27 15:12:16	@ikcivanderson you were walking from the phoenix, past the common room. Was a very disappointing moment altogether
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-27 16:26:52	There's such a thing of hazelnut ice-cream :o My. God.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-27 16:58:22	Already got my summer ball ticket #Boom #OnTheBall

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-30 15:47:42	Spotting an old teacher in the library and being well past the stage where it's acceptable to say hi #awkymomo
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-30 15:48:34	@erbekah oh my god. i just cried a little &lt;/3
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-30 16:16:41	@erbekah this could actually explain why I've recently rekindled my love for them :')
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-31 16:17:37	Thought my coffee tasted very strange, then realised that i sprayed perfume into it. Yes, it is possible to be this stupid.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-01 10:38:06	Stayed up til all hours doing an assignment, but it was all worth it for this mornings lie in #holla
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-01 00:02:45	Wham, bam, bambi
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-31 11:20:25	Lord, give me strength
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-31 11:24:46	Never have I ever loved the bean bag room, as I do at this very moment
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-31 11:53:52	I'm being the ultimate creep and I don't even care
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-02 18:27:39	All i want, is to go to a house party
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-31 13:35:50	I'm a terrible flirt
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-03-31 13:37:46	And I mean that in a literal sense. I am really bad at flirting.. 'insert laughing face emoji which may actually be a crying face'
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-02 15:01:17	So confused by all of this
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-02 15:29:52	Fairtrade puffins on a plane
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-02 15:40:24	Made a fry for everyone this morning. I'm such a good woman..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-02 17:54:49	@Farrell03 its done now! Stop your whining..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-02 18:06:20	Resisted the urge to buy sausage rolls so i wouldnt defy my fellow mandate members and cross the picket line
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-03 17:26:11	40 mins an episode. 12 episodes a season. 4 seasons. This midterm is gonna be well spent #Suits
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-02 22:03:28	I should just not talk while im out
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-02 22:09:22	Fairtrade..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-04 15:04:28	What I would give to be where I was this day 2 weeks ago
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-04 16:07:30	Driving with a creek in your neck is a bad idea and a painful ordeal
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-08 00:31:07	@AoifeGilmartin what?:o Where are you going? I'm heading to the Bronx/Yonkers area :D already planning to meet Carmel :P #gilmartinstakeonNY

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-07 14:05:36	Losing track of all the things i need to do but still so excited #Summer2015 #nycyeahbuddy
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-07 14:12:02	The colour of my hair used to be a topic of great debate in school, and to this day, it still is. #Momentous
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-09 00:47:46	But of all my mistakes, you're still my favourite one #Keywest #gem
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-09 00:56:58	I've said it before, I'll say it again. My brother has a better social life than me..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-08 14:51:28	Last week, it was peaches. This week, I stink of tea tree oil
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-09 02:49:03	We both know how this goes
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-10 14:52:27	It amazes me just how little I have achieved this week
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-10 18:49:42	That episode really got to me #weeping
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-09 12:56:45	Got a 4096 tile. I dominate 2048.
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-09 13:03:26	@erbekah That's incredibly creepy.. I was considering a stroll around carton today :o and i'm bringing my cousin to get ice cream in btown!
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-09 13:04:07	@erbekah I'm beginning to resent this predictability
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-09 13:16:33	@erbekah They are magical.. &lt;3
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-09 13:18:33	@ikcivanderson .. I'm not quite sure what to say
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-09 13:19:25	I've an incredible desire to go to the beach today
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-09 13:20:28	@ikcivanderson aww shpanks Sister ;)
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-09 13:21:31	@erbekah yes! if the weather is this good next week, btown 99s are a must *thumbs up* (I'm on my laptop- I lack emojis :( )
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-09 15:37:56	I have both the space and drink for a sun session, but I've no friends to accompany it.. :'( #foreveralone
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-11 19:36:21	#Suits has taken over my life
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-11 23:35:26	This saving craic is no fun
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-11 23:36:05	I think my ass may actually scar. Well, at least its a story for the grandkids
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-11 23:39:54	Oh fudge. What have i just started..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-12 00:13:22	Giving out about why guys should not shave their beards #latenightthoughts #justgirlythings
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-12 00:15:43	I have really upset this guy about his decision to shave his beard. I feel guilty, and yet, i laugh #beardsaretheway
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-12 00:59:54	Sleep has been eluding me well these past few nights #humph
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-13 16:17:22	@marko93101 but, im fun..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-13 16:04:38	@marko93101 can i come too?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-13 16:07:05	When the stranger uses the line 'Now I know everything about you', theres definitely something wrong #Stalkerfeels
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-13 18:18:45	So my plan to not spend money has gone horribly bad
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-13 18:22:08	I always make eye contact with someone, then look away &amp; realise who it is. By then its too late to say hi. Then i seem like an awful bitch
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-13 18:22:43	Struggles
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-13 22:38:53	I'd say Gabriel is something fierce with some stubble #omnomnom
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-14 12:03:40	Ive spent so much this week already. Just take my card. Someone. Please
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-14 12:06:25	@erbekah it was probably Declan the 2nd of Bradys. Hes wandering the streets of maynooth a lot lately
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-13 23:09:57	I was right
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-14 12:55:45	@erbekah yup, that's him! He was in the pharmacy earlier. They kind of stole him.. haha
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-15 11:45:10	Dying for this day to end #shattered
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-15 11:46:02	Sometimes, all it takes is a bit of slagging for ya to realise that your employers have been screwing you for a while
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-14 15:45:56	Its so frustrating when the only thing people talk about is college work and exams #relaxlads
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-15 16:01:14	What do we do in labs? Gawk at the gorgeous TA of course
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-15 22:17:22	Made friends with one of the security lads in work. 10 minutes later, I forgot his name and it has yet to come back to me.. #badkera
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-16 11:27:22	@Stephen_Fay shut yo face
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-16 16:04:32	Someone once told me that I can't 'life'.. I'm starting to agree with them
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-18 12:14:46	The first few days after you get your hair cut are the hardest. I mean, what am I supposed to do with it?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-17 15:43:40	@ikcivanderson not even slightly bad &lt;3 #thetrueJB
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-17 16:20:09	Every time
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-19 01:30:06	Running into people you work with on a night out.. no fun
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-18 16:37:27	Forever in the wars
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-19 03:16:51	Roost on Saturdays, yes
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-17 21:48:43	If someone could come with me on Monday, that'd be great #countrygirlinthebigcity
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-19 13:46:26	I got so used to not having anything to do that I forgot about all the assignments I got this week #boo

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-04-21 22:23:59	I'm finding everything so ridiculously funny lately.. its not right, unless its actually funny #institches

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-08 16:50:27	Can't believe the year is over already. No. Time needs to stop, now.

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-13 01:02:07	My biggest achievement today was finally trying twisty fries
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-14 11:07:29	In desperate need of sockets
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-14 12:24:44	Just saw Darren, and he was looking dapper. My day has greatly improved
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-14 12:46:22	Told a guy he was a virus. Honestly thought that'd be enough of a clue #goaway
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-15 02:09:11	Didn't even have tome to go for a procrastination run. I would consider that a successful day of studying 👍🏻🙏🏼📱📚📝😓🙍🏻 #emojis

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-17 14:26:54	Going out of my mind, I need to tell you something
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-17 14:27:24	The bang of alcohol in this room #withdrawals
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-17 23:16:44	Managed to smuggle two library books out of the library today. Am I a federal spy yet?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-19 08:50:27	How is it that so few people know that I'm doing a J1
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-19 08:53:18	@marko93101 I felt bad cause I felt I was constantly going on about it 😔
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-19 08:56:00	@marko93101 maybe, subconsciously, I didn't tell you cause I was hoping to avoid all these emotions. I can see that worked out well.. #sorry
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-19 08:56:51	@marko93101 isn't it better now though, than the day I'm actually leaving?
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-19 09:55:31	@ConorNerney @Stephen_Fay @marko93101 to be fair, I probably told ye. Ye just weren't listening cause everything else I say is shite..
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-19 09:59:36	I was feeling okay about this exam til this morning #foooked

35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-19 18:47:49	@marko93101 @ConorNerney @Stephen_Fay I'll work on it 👍🏼
35062818	ciaragilmartin	2015-05-19 18:53:53	Had a dream last night that my dog died. I deemed that a good enough excuse to stay home today and I was right 👍🏼🙊
