351640670	Ashleen86	2013-01-11 20:27:09	Major urge to watch #ProjectX because it's just a damn good movie. And it gets me in the urge to RAAAAAVE!!! #WhatASoundtrack
351640670	Ashleen86	2013-01-11 20:28:25	@LuLudoll89 @tomc1989 That is just disgusting!! How can gay marriage be such a "crime" when it's completely normal to fuck a horse?!!
351640670	Ashleen86	2013-01-11 21:16:29	Oh look, I can pull a squishy face too..... Jealous much?? #PretendingToBeSomeoneYourNot

351640670	Ashleen86	2013-01-11 21:48:28	@MattCrez Nope - dissing someone trying to be @EmmaAllan1 actually.......it's probably bit lost on you Matt lol

351640670	Ashleen86	2013-08-08 11:40:43	@lou584 Yeah that's probably it! Maybe Sagittarius and Virgo don't mix well lol
351640670	Ashleen86	2013-08-08 08:27:55	Still stuck at home not able to get to work thanks to @SW_Trains and the signalling problem at Soton. Not that I mind but my boss does!!
351640670	Ashleen86	2013-08-08 09:20:46	@EmmaAllan1 @SW_Trains Me either! And considering I pay £480 a month for their service, I'm definitely being ripped off! #NotForLongThough

351640670	Ashleen86	2013-08-09 09:09:39	Looks like I've got myself a little stalker - reporting stuff I do and say back to a certain someone. It's not clever. #GrowTheFuckUp
351640670	Ashleen86	2013-08-09 09:11:02	@7ony_ I do sit on Twitter and Facebook a lot though so that probably doesn't help lol but it's still a shit battery life regardless!
