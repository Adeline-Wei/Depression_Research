352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 14:46:21	Starting at community health centre. Shout out to lady bugs program for girls and other great programs
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 14:47:59	Strong core group dedicated community engagement
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 14:49:57	One payphone for 100 acres. Not one retail option in the area http://t.co/0RXnlxe
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 14:54:02	More fences here than neeed. Why needed?
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 14:55:52	Not as many passes over the allen express. Locked in feeling.  Same with small couts.
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 14:57:36	5000 people live in the area. Rent geard to housing model.
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 14:58:58	Streets all courtyards one way in and out with small connecting footpaths. Tough to police.
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 15:03:29	Beautiful park but unsafe because of the hills and trees! Safety issues being adressed soon by Yorkdale http://t.co/1XnFx82
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 15:05:57	Yorkdale subway not safe for use at night so poorly used.
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 15:08:29	@JoshColle leads regular safety walks to identify needs
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 15:12:12	Great stories of upcoming artists. Glimmer of hope
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 15:13:58	One street too dangerous to come out of house at night. Police on bikes over cars helps
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 15:16:51	No one here reports crimes because they all know each other
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 15:19:57	Issues are systemic. Too many people with too many needs. Not solved with just more programs
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 15:23:39	@JoshColle advocating for improvement of Lawrence Heights. Says not good for people inside or near.
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 15:24:24	Area filled with working poor. Can't support families so they end up here.
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 15:29:28	Nice park but path unsafe that leads to subway http://t.co/nEQwfEh
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 15:34:52	Mixing diff housing must be part of the solution says @JoshColle. Should be phased
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 15:57:00	Thank you @JoshColle for the tour of Lawrence Heights. So informative. A lot to do yet. But great progress making this safer for all.
352269656	WendyKauffman1	2011-08-19 15:59:05	Recommendation to all to ask @JoshColle for your own tour of Lawrence Heights. Don't miss out on critical learning in #Toronto.
