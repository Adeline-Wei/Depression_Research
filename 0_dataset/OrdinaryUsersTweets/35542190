35542190	shane_case	2013-04-23 16:39:39	@Cgafney14 Think you and the wife should organise a little couples BBQ day ;)
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-23 17:35:48	@87bowers @cgafney14 Don't need 2 tell me twice boys #Summer http://t.co/FofCejePLN

35542190	shane_case	2013-04-23 20:13:38	That was brilliant from Muller :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-23 20:15:19	@Mark___Harris It was a thing of beauty :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-23 20:23:46	Munich are a dangerous machine!! @maxiheld will be delighted 2night

35542190	shane_case	2013-04-23 22:37:09	#TheFollowing is incredible ... I'm pretty sure I was 5 feet away from @JamesPurefoy aka Joe Carroll in south Petherton the other day!!
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-24 18:58:35	@Football__Tweet glad I put him as 1st goal scorer... I'm on fire at the moment
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 20:45:54	Townsend must be in utter disbelief at the tackle. Bloody great challenge in my eyes
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 20:47:46	Never a pen! Come on Cech
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 20:51:35	@JamieGreen1988 That was a shocker!!
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 20:53:51	Torres is useful mind!
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 20:55:30	Yes Luis!! Well deserved
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 20:55:52	“@JamieGreen1988: This free kick is going in, you heard it here first!”  Well done sir
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 20:57:22	@bmorgy7 Was a great challenge.!! Football is 2 soft these days! So what if there's a leg break :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 21:00:13	@bmorgy7 Yeah, he would of gone normally. Nasri and Sturridge got away with a cppl @ the weekend! Mayb football is coming back :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 10:46:35	@kerrywhite83 she at my nans. I'll get her to give u a buzz when she's back x
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 10:46:47	@87bowers haha, it all made sense when u walked in
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-26 09:50:35	@olliewake @luke_lazenby he should of got longer. He got 10 games for same offence last time. Great player tho !!
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-26 10:11:42	@Luke_Lazenby he's a footballer. In boxing Tyson got fine 3 million and banned for 18 months and that's a sport of physical violence!
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-26 11:54:38	“@JamesPurefoy: Can you resist? http://t.co/OmJG17MAne” @OzHotham @sam88max @samualkendall

35542190	shane_case	2013-04-26 18:39:59	@olliewake sorry mate I thought u were replying 2 pen mill tweet haha. It's nxt sat mate! Getting involved ?
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-26 20:29:43	I can safely say that Deeney for Watford will never make a prem striker. #TerribleTekkers
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 20:20:47	We go again Saturday @Pen_Mill_FC ... #UpTheFuckingMill
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 20:21:35	@MajorCabell @pen_mill_fc Any you do a bloody good job mate. Valuable team member!!
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 20:32:31	Townsend how are you suggesting a red card for that challenge. Jesus Christ I hate modern football!!
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 20:34:43	@OzHotham The keeper would have got a cheeki stud then as well. Bring back proper football
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 20:56:21	@Scott_McRoy Bet u had some money on that ? :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 21:02:50	@bmorgy7 to be fair I'd risk a leg break for 50-100k a week?
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-25 21:05:12	Referees should be made to give an interview after games I think. Would be interesting
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-27 08:53:17	#UFC159 is gonna be summin special. Jonny Bones Jones 2 destroy Sonnen
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-27 11:34:08	@smudge_smith what??
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-26 07:57:00	@MelanieShoe I want your job!!
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-26 10:01:11	@Luke_Lazenby @olliewake but how can he get less games than he did last time?
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-26 10:11:04	@Luke_Lazenby Different circumstances. You can get sent off for 2 missed timed tackles. Biting is not part of the game. He's very lucky
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-26 10:12:31	@Luke_Lazenby very soft punishment mate. Stop letting the Liverpool fan syndrome get in the way of your judgement
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-26 10:18:59	@olliewake @luke_lazenby Haha thank you. Once I get going I can't stop :) #SorryFolks
35542190	shane_case	2013-04-26 12:53:39	@MelanieShoe One of my specialities that.., Shane's BBQ sauce would go perfectly with that bad boy pork :)

35542190	shane_case	2013-05-03 19:06:26	The standard in League 1 is pretty poor. Pushing and miss times tackles every 2 minutes
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-03 19:15:35	@JohnnyEssex87 Don't be 2 confident our John
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-03 19:17:40	@JohnnyEssex87 Oh I thought u were talking about the final! Yeah but still long way 2 go. 2 hard games
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-03 19:29:53	Haha, the tackling is ridiculous. He'd be off in the top flight.
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-03 19:32:51	@JamieGreen1988 Looks like Johnson has had @JohnnyEssex87 down there this week on tackling training duties!!
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-03 19:33:16	I've seen less physical contact in a game of rugby
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-03 19:34:56	@JohnnyEssex87 @JamieGreen1988 I'd have you @ the back in this yeo team. At least you'd put the player out of the game!
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-03 19:38:36	@GenoWarr Well I didn't like 2 say it :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-03 19:47:27	@GenoWarr no mate. I've had a (Putting it nicely) sickness bug for the last 48 hours. Lost nearly half stone. I've not got it in me m8
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-03 19:48:04	Finding out @sblackmore88 wasn't aloud in the ground for being 2 pissed had made this game a lot better
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-03 19:51:35	@Cotty100 @JohnnyEssex87 @JamieGreen1988 Has he not? That's good 2 no for Tuesday night.

35542190	shane_case	2013-05-02 19:34:20	@mrackham14 It's game on. I'm relying heavily on RVP mind
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-03 19:56:54	@JamieGreen1988 @Cotty100 @JohnnyEssex87 @CraigWood_ Woods is dangerous in the tackle Flem !!
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-03 19:59:33	@JohnnyEssex87 @JamieGreen1988 @Cotty100 @CraigWood_ Haha, just promise not 2 break anything mate ;)

35542190	shane_case	2013-05-08 10:42:53	I've called for the special one but Motes would certainly be a worthy choice for united... Very good manager.
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-08 10:45:42	@sam88max who has re-tweeted u lol. Dunno bout that, Sir Alex wasn't exactly silent
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-08 11:01:48	@sam88max haha, best mate. Yeah I think he'd be a good manager. Only worry is that would he attract the very best players from abroad

35542190	shane_case	2013-05-09 11:04:28	I'd let Rooney leave... Bale would be a lovely replacement :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-09 15:04:30	Moyes has been confirmed as manager. Takes over on July 1st...
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-09 15:08:32	Moyes vs Mourinho Moyes vs Wenger Moyes Vs Mancini ... It's not the same!! #FergieDontGo #UTurn

35542190	shane_case	2013-05-08 07:10:51	If Fergie is leaving United, Jose will not be going to Chelsea!
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-08 07:46:45	@olliewake it's gotta be the only reason he would leave! He wants Jose there and knows he's heading 2 chels. Exciting summer coming up

35542190	shane_case	2013-05-15 20:19:33	Think they was a pen! If the ref makes the proper decision, Torres wouldn't have 2 dive
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-16 14:17:03	What a career #SirDavidBeckham has had. The greatest right foot football has ever seen in my opinion.
35542190	shane_case	2013-05-16 14:35:49	@yhiggins1 You better place me on suicide watch. Football is over!!!!!

35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 11:03:05	@olliewake haha, we put some effort into it. Salad, scotch eggs, pâté and a couple naughty crackers with cheese :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 11:08:54	@VernonLIVE I don't wanna be getting arrested down here vern :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 13:37:06	Cricket is better than football. I've just took 2 catches in the stand
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 13:38:05	@JakeGallagher_ we wish you were bloody here mate
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 13:39:48	@sam88max you no I'm bloody good in the field :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 14:33:34	@JamieOverton With some supreme bowling today
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 19:24:40	Johnson is so weak defensively. Should be his number one priority.. Bring back Neville or Carragher
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 19:28:18	It's a friendly. Wish we would just try and attack and play some footie. Who gives a shit if we loose 5 nil. Why are we playing 4 a draw!
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 20:13:22	Walcott!!!!!!!!!! Jesus Christ
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 20:15:24	@GenoWarr that pass 2 Milner was on all day long. Frustrating player
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 20:16:17	Why can't we have a player with Rooney's ability and Walcott's pace
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 20:28:49	Now that man is a player!!! Why, why why start Milner when we have his ability!
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 20:35:15	“@CraigWood_: #TheOx” He's a player. Great ability
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 20:40:09	Wazza you beauty...
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 20:40:44	@CraigWood_ Wilshere is needed big time. We are doing ok with this shit atm. Shocking
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 20:41:59	Attacking players result in goals Roy... Learn from this. The ox is a must start!
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 20:44:38	I 4got about our bloody defenders! Rodwell winner!
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 20:54:05	Phil Jones is miles ahead of Johnson at right back as is Smalling
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 21:38:32	@CraigWood_ @87bowers That's exactly right toss. England would get about 30 points 4 beating San Marino but only 5 4 beating brazil #Crazy
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-02 21:42:39	“@earthposts: Best Vacation For You!! http://t.co/S2GBw2eHVI” @yhiggins1 check out the holiday for you sign! #Perfect

35542190	shane_case	2013-06-03 20:06:08	@OzHotham How about when @JamieOverton takes a wicket in the YB40
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-03 20:49:18	@floryboy @Pen_Mill_FC @smudge_smith it was a cracker. I think smudge picked @ random in the end
35542190	shane_case	2013-06-04 21:43:51	@RossTC21 is that my arse looking incredible or Wakes :)

35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 18:59:45	Transfer deadline day has been briefly interrupted my @jamieoliver
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 19:14:45	@JamieOliverCom Make pesto with leftover basil. Throw into ice cube trays and then they are ready 2 go with cooked past!
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 19:48:44	Lukaku 2 Everton would be the deal of the day!
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 19:50:31	Really don't get how Arsenal have persuaded Ozil 2 join! Can only think he's gonna be awesome for arsenal then move 2 City in a cppl yrs :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 19:54:11	@mrackham14 Liverpool have a great squad. When Suarez is back I can see Liverpool right up there.
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 19:57:35	“@AssouEkotto: Lets go to QPR !   I ll keep one eyes on u spurs hv a good luck this season #COYS💋🙏👊❤” @OzHotham
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 20:34:00	Mourinho has lost the plot! Doesn't play Chelsea's player of the year and possibly letting the best young player in the prem go.
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 21:07:56	Haha, Joe Bloggs pretends 2 be united representatives. Wish I'd thought of that, could have a lot of bloody fun today!
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 21:37:42	Defoe @ Everton?? English international ?
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-01 19:51:46	What a game...
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 08:20:51	@Football__Tweet If he's half as good as he is on footie manager, Liverpool have one hell of a signing there !
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 08:21:55	Ozil 2 united?? Would still like the big Belgian!!
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 08:24:12	@Shins83 Yeah I think everyone is under rating Fellani . Will score goals and cause all sorts of problems. Don't get me wrong..
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 08:24:30	@Shins83 I wouldn't mind Ozil gracing the old Trafford turf. Beautiful little player
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 08:26:22	Would also like to see Defoe move to a club where he's gonna play every game.. Great goal scorer, a move would be good for England
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 09:21:25	Be nice if united got rid of Nani today... Swap deal with Ben Afra at Newcastle ?
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 09:25:23	Moses 2 Liverpool as well. Rogers is putting together a top squad @ Liverpool. I'm predicting top 4 for them this season
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 09:28:40	It's all footie talk over here on Twitter... Meanwhile, there's a few kids enjoying their 1st day @ school according to Facebook zzzzz
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-05 07:31:07	@RossTC21 @Roberto1311 Listened 2 AM yesterday. Too good. Can't wait for the hard copy 2 arrive :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-05 07:35:48	@RossTC21 @Roberto1311 Some top music out this month. Hard to handle
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 21:38:47	Sorry Everton, it's only Barry.. Don't piss your selfs
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 21:42:22	Paul Gilmour, you've got 1 ugly fucker stood next 2 you!!
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 21:44:25	@AdeWilt13 if he couldn't help Madrid dominate Spanish football he's certainly not helping arsenal dominate the prem!
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 21:46:07	@ronaldeano10 I agree. He will be a great signing if it goes through. He destroyed united last season.Exactly the type of player united need
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 21:46:58	@steve90newton Can't believe your hatred of Fellaini!
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 21:50:54	@steve90newton yeah exactly what united need in my opinion. Proven in the prem, strong, powerful, goals. Herrera? Do united really need...
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 21:51:57	@steve90newton him? Would he of added anything different from Rooney/Kagawa/Nani/Young/Cleverly,Velencia?
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 21:54:19	Love the excitement of arsenal fans. Remember you still have a back 4 of Sagna, Mertesacker, Kocielny, and Gibbs
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 21:55:50	@AdeWilt13 me either. They have about 8 great attacking midfield players. Can't believe they haven't gone for a defender.
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 21:56:55	@steve90newton Nonsense my boy. We shall see as the season unfolds. Don't get 2 upset tho. Things will be alright
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 21:58:38	Liverpool have by far done the best business. Strengthened in all the areas that needed strengthening. Plus they have kept Suarez!
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 22:03:15	@Jodyafcparks na Gibbs didn't play. I remember him ruining me with my dream team. Sagna either!!!
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 22:11:21	@Jodyafcparks maybe.. I feel man city, chels and spurs have improved even more
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-02 22:26:47	The predictable Moyes is shit chant coming from a few united fans tonight. #SupportYourClub #KnowYourFootball
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-06 10:27:53	@the1975 Heart out... Cracking little tune
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-06 14:53:43	@MattNewens @NME Nice. Get me there
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 07:07:24	@RossTC21 well said my man. I don't understand people wanting Herrera over Fellaini. Think there's a few living in football manager land!
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 07:07:52	@AdeWilt13 your not a fan either then?
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 07:11:36	@ja_barber have faith my man. I think the big Belgian will become a fans favourite.
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 07:23:08	@RossTC21 I'm sure he can play a bit. Fellaini scored more goals in the prem last year than Herrera has in his whole career! That will do me
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 07:26:05	Instead of united dipping into the transfer market yesterday, they should of got Anderson out of nando's and onto a bloody treadmill.
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 07:26:51	@ja_barber I have faith, he'll be out Yaya Toure. He's one big bully and a love it :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 07:59:24	@AdeWilt13 yeah poss but when eva utd come knocking a club will add 10m 2 the price. At least it's not 50m for Torres or 35 for Carroll :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 08:33:52	@Shins83 Top player but do arsenal need another attacking midfield player? Think Eriksen was the best buy.
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 08:39:15	@JamieGreen1988 #JoseOut after that Lukaku decision. You must be fuming with that ?
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 08:41:30	@ianharris1982 Haha, they do indeed. Well all the ones with technical ability. If we wanted 2 run we would of taken up athletics :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 08:48:34	@Shins83 where's the defensive option? Hope your not suggesting Wiltshire as a holding midfielder? Ox out for 3 or 4 months. Nice on paper..
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 08:51:29	@Shins83 and I think they will compete with the footballing sides but struggle against the rough teams as usual. They needed more 4 me
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 09:12:34	@Shins83 certainly be interesting. Eto'o could be a good signing for chels as well.
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 09:45:05	@harroldo16 @paulipearbear01 I'll echo those thoughts gibbo. All a bit of a shock to some fans isn't it.
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 10:58:58	@olliewake @Shins83 Yeah I agree wakey. Can't work out the Lakuku one. Scored more than both ba and Torres put 2gether last yr
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 11:38:09	@JamieGreen1988 I love the bloke. Quick, powerful and direct. Sounds like another certain striker who used 2 grace the Stamford Bridge turf!
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-03 14:53:54	@JamieGreen1988 My mistake

35542190	shane_case	2013-09-22 15:48:32	Fully deserved. City have hammered united in the 1st half. Nothing to lose now Moyes. Gotta go for it surely!
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-22 15:51:39	United have been woeful down the left side today.
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-22 16:09:23	Lucky im a Leicester City fan :). What a day for city!

35542190	shane_case	2013-09-30 18:37:46	@LeeRHDavey Haha, I'm not sure I can even blame that on the iPhone :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-30 20:59:55	@JordyHenley6 Dumb to let him go in my opinion. He was ready to be unleashed this season for Chelsea. Was scoring in pre season?
35542190	shane_case	2013-09-30 21:00:40	“@pete_lauchlan: 5/1 great price for lukaku #beauty” Easy money!!

35542190	shane_case	2013-10-02 18:45:40	Come on then Manchester. Lets make it a great week for English clubs in Europe.
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-02 18:53:19	Hart will take stick here but closing down from Navas was pathetic. Should of watched #TheFoxes last night. Blocking shots everywhere..
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-02 18:57:34	Get down!! Richards you monster.
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-02 19:06:27	“@scottsmith1980: Shakhtar must be over the moon, welbeck is starting #Butheworkshard ;-)” (Cough) :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-05 14:15:32	Suarez you beauty. Another 1st goal scorer for me. Still plenty of bets in play and Liverpool re central to many. @bet365 with gr8 odds
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-05 14:20:00	SAS on fire @ Liverpool. Suarez to get the next goal @ a tasty 7/2
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-05 14:41:44	@paulipearbear01 I'll give you it... :)

35542190	shane_case	2013-10-09 06:57:14	Redknapp's book is going to be a great read. He's not holding anything back by some of the articles I read!
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-09 08:11:00	@MattNewens More like uncle Albert !

35542190	shane_case	2013-10-08 07:21:21	@J_E_Massey @Kaiserkuehn This is brilliant... "Does anyone mind if I work on my cannon balls" :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-11 20:34:53	That was like watching Stuart Howsley score @ wembley #TopCoaching
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 19:37:34	We are playing some sexy football.
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 19:38:52	Where has this Townsend lad come from them. 4th best player in the world :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 19:39:42	@JamieGreen1988 He's lacking with his finishing but working like a cart horse.. Far better than any other option!
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 19:40:51	@JordyHenley6 gotta be worth 50m buy now!! #WalterWhiteMoney

35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 20:50:29	Great week for England. Fantastic pair of performances. Hopefully Townsend kicks on and becomes a real star now.
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 19:11:07	I feel a bit of good old fashioned English spirit here!
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 19:43:26	@paulipearbear01 @JamieGreen1988 What on the left??
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 20:25:41	Carrick coming off is a strange one?
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 20:26:39	Do not get that at all. Carrick has been so good on the ball. He's been right so far tho. Keep the faith !
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 20:32:14	“@JackLouisBaker: Welbz getting some unfair abuse tonight” Totally agree. He a work horse. He's put a lot in tonight!
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 20:33:15	We have finally got some players with real class that can go past a defender. Fantastic to see!
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 21:54:48	@CraigWood_ @FootyAccums haha what was the point

35542190	shane_case	2013-10-14 08:16:08	@DaniTread I'm do like a cuppa I must admit. Especially when it accompanies a cheeky bacon sarny :)
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-14 09:35:46	Got a feeling that letting 20,000 Poland fans attend the game tomoz will come back and bite us in the arse.
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-14 09:39:25	@CraigWood_ They had nothing 2 play for. Now they have an extra 15,000 people 2 play for. Somebody send #TheFA a psychology text book!!
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-14 09:54:05	@ThunderLeg123 @CraigWood_ That's a very positive way of looking @ things.
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-14 09:58:25	@ThunderLeg123 @CraigWood_ That's more like it. Luckily for all the idiots running the game we have some half decent players playing it.
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 19:05:14	Listen 2 those polish fans!!
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 19:22:33	Poland are doubling up on Townsend... What a compliment for the lad
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 19:23:16	Haha ... Roy "Fuck Me!!!"
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-15 20:49:29	@LeeRHDavey I think he's played loads of lovely passes through the lines into Roon, welbeck, Sturridge and Townsend
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-18 08:14:28	@Bailey8822 Haha your plates are still as organised as ever :)

35542190	shane_case	2013-10-26 12:00:12	You can see the whole pitch on BT sport. I look @ Arteta and Ramsey on the ball, see the right winger free 60yrds away and think #SCHOLES
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-26 13:31:32	Ramsey 2 Giroud ... #FantasyFootball
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-26 13:38:41	Not a great performance from Arsenal. Sign of a championship winning side??
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-27 16:31:05	Oh Fernando... Back to your best

35542190	shane_case	2013-10-27 16:39:49	@RossTC21 @JamieGreen1988 Thought it was me chasing Torres at one point
35542190	shane_case	2013-10-27 17:55:18	Players just put that extra 15% in for Mourinho

35542190	shane_case	2013-12-04 21:44:06	@olliewake @steve90newton imagine him joining bale and Ronaldo in attack for Madrid! Jesus Christ!!!
35542190	shane_case	2013-12-04 21:47:51	@steve90newton @olliewake would be sensational. Mind you Figo, Ronaldo, Raul, Zidane wasn't bad was it!

35542190	shane_case	2013-12-01 13:10:08	Why can't Valencia cross a ball?
35542190	shane_case	2013-12-01 13:13:14	Goalkeepers have got 2 be the dumbest species on the planet.
35542190	shane_case	2013-12-01 13:17:52	This is the hat trick. Far left corner

35542190	shane_case	2013-12-01 13:24:14	@matpitcher I miss those kind of tackles. Wes Brown getting sent off last week was scandalous. Great smash.

35542190	shane_case	2013-12-29 11:39:21	@JamieGreen1988 I cancelled my Nuffield gym membership in place of that one. Best decision of my life
35542190	shane_case	2013-12-29 18:16:33	Chelsea were very lucky with 4 decisions today
35542190	shane_case	2013-12-29 21:20:33	The class of 92 is a incredible watch.
35542190	shane_case	2013-12-29 21:26:51	@westlandsfc5 loving it mate
35542190	shane_case	2013-12-29 21:30:03	@westlandsfc5 haha. "What happened to that Ryan Wilson lad"
35542190	shane_case	2013-12-29 21:43:13	@olliewake not yet. Just finishing the main bit
35542190	shane_case	2013-12-27 08:33:12	@steve90newton haha, you could say the same if City were missing kompany, toure, aguero and negredo!
35542190	shane_case	2013-12-27 08:58:49	Getting sent off on Boxing Day is always suspicious. These footballers clearly have a night out planned for NY Eve
35542190	shane_case	2013-12-27 09:03:51	That confirms it... Marc Wilson is definitely planning a night on the booze. #Nutter
35542190	shane_case	2013-12-27 09:04:55	@olliewake Cabaye would be cracking little transfer if available! I don't like the idea of all these names linked from foreign leagues!
35542190	shane_case	2013-12-27 09:29:49	@olliewake especially in jan. They need someone who can improve them immediately. Lallana??
35542190	shane_case	2013-12-27 10:32:29	@olliewake @joshsinger1 haha. Very true. I'm sure they will be signing a few
35542190	shane_case	2013-12-27 19:39:46	Before you say it. I know your going to be watching home alone on E4!

35542190	shane_case	2014-01-05 14:07:51	Southampton away. Cracking day lined up. Better give our local pub a call @sblackmore88

35542190	shane_case	2014-01-05 14:11:57	@CraigWood_ It would be a tasty day.
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-05 14:12:31	@GoldiMc Shouldn't be to difficult my friend. #AwayDay
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-05 14:13:57	@CraigWood_ If Yeovil weren't playing I would have been all over that trip. I was hoping for Liverpool away

35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 21:11:59	@CraigWood_ you could learn a lot... Remember that conversation we had about striker chasing lost causes :)
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 21:13:58	@CraigWood_ haha. God I'm an embarrassment :). Just joined @1610active  tonight
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 21:15:52	@CraigWood_ @NuffieldHealth I know that feeling
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 12:27:46	@DeadlineDayLive @Football__Tweet @sam88max This would be disastrous for you!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 12:30:46	@sam88max haha yeah. There may be some lasting damage though.
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 12:32:16	Massive game for @OfficialFOXES tonight. I'm going for the famous 2-1 scoreline
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 12:32:42	@sam88max just checked the gas levels and said it was fine.
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 21:17:35	@CraigWood_ @NuffieldHealth hahahaha. I sweat when I drink a hot drink!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-11 11:06:18	@sam88max @samualkendall @OzHotham He actually saw my beard when he came in my shop and decided 2 use my look for Carrol's new look :)
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-11 11:11:13	Tottenham, qpr, Burnley and orient for today 4 fold. #ShanesTips
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-11 12:55:46	@AdeWilt13 oh no , I wasn't expecting anybody to do it :) Looks a sure win to me!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-11 13:14:06	@AdeWilt13 it's a banker mate ;)
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 19:58:53	@MurrayCook10 I dunno but Matty James should have finished that
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 20:09:43	@MurrayCook10 well said my cook
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 20:10:20	Great effort @nuge101235 ... Should be going to the World Cup @OzHotham
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 20:12:28	Great goal for @OfficialFOXES .. Terrible defending though
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 20:13:11	@CraigWood_ he reminded me of cafu there. Surging up from RB :)
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 20:23:28	Could be 6 up by now...
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 20:38:04	@CraigWood_ My thought exactly mate. They have put in a couple decent set pieces
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 20:52:18	@nuge101235 with the goal of the season so far
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 21:02:38	@CraigWood_ bloody set piece
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 21:03:33	Clear pen. Come on then @nuge101235
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 21:08:05	@CraigWood_ Our strikers are work horses.
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-12 03:42:59	@PJakeGallagher @OzHotham I'm so glad you put it on Chep. Makes me bloody happy
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 21:10:23	@CraigWood_ yeah he's been a class act all season. I have to admit, at the start of season I was calling for Woods to start.
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 21:38:11	Fantastic performance tonight @OfficialFOXES
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 21:38:40	@OzHotham our favourite player of all time!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 21:41:01	Now for the mighty @ytfcofficial to upset Burnley tomorrow and it's a perfect weekend of Championship football
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-10 22:11:53	I literally can't cope with the undateables... 'Will you fancy me'
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-12 18:18:57	@PJakeGallagher Suarez brace #ShanesTips 2 for 2
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-12 18:25:51	@CraigWood_ your bloody useless sky blues let me down on my treble today. You owe me £10
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-12 11:53:23	@PJakeGallagher cant see a decent accy but a Suarez brace looks a tempting bet at the moment
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-12 11:56:52	@PJakeGallagher @TGall196 That would be nice. Are you down for the Yeovil game then?
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-12 11:58:12	@PJakeGallagher this is bloody exciting. I'm looking forward to being beard twins for the day
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-14 15:41:21	It must be a sad day for @CraigWood_ A @ytfcofficial player deemed not good enough for the club has been snapped up by @Coventry_City
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-14 15:54:05	@CraigWood_ @Coventry_City @ytfcofficial Fighting talk... With a seaborne bullet header no doubt.
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-14 17:29:09	@CraigWood_ @FL72Transfers haha. No chance. Konchesky has just picked up a knock so the lad is needed at the moment

35542190	shane_case	2014-01-23 16:24:54	I think it's all a clever ploy. Jose really thinks Mata is Chelsea's best player and wants him at UTD for when he takes over in the summer
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-23 16:27:54	@SamGlover84 I would Like to see Moyes test Newcastle for Cabaye now.
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-23 17:34:28	Dani Osvaldo has been suspended for two weeks by Southampton for beating up José Fonte in training this morning. #SaintsFC” @OzHotham haha
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-25 09:32:54	@GenoWarr It's immense Georgie my boy
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-26 17:06:15	@OzHotham here he bloody is then. How are you big man??
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-26 17:10:19	@OzHotham bit fragile today my man. You must be feeling like the grim reaper has had a go at you!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-28 21:44:49	@6Lkf Snap mate. Let me down for £200
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-28 21:46:22	And #TheFoxes go marching on... 2-1 our favourite result of the season.
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-28 21:48:55	United are only 12 points behind Arsenal now... Is this the start of Arsenals fall?
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-28 21:52:44	@12345white there fixtures are ridiculous. Not really saying United will catch them but I think they will be finishing 3rd or 4th again.
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-28 21:53:20	@6Lkf Could be the start of the famous comeback
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-28 21:53:42	@olliewake Amen brother
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-28 22:16:04	“@CharltonJoe: 8 wins from 8. Im dreaming @OfficialFOXES” Great performance again by all accounts. U getting to any games in the near future
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-28 22:19:01	@CharltonJoe @OfficialFOXES Nice effort ... Bring on another 3 points. I'm gonna have to get down a few time towards the end of the season
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-29 20:57:41	Jesus this could be a cricket score. Great for United!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-29 21:15:08	@John_France @ClaroRonaldo That is a thing of beauty... I want one
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-29 21:17:33	@John_France @ClaroRonaldo Id give anything to go back and watch him in his pomp. My favourite player of all time. Where can I get one :)
35542190	shane_case	2014-01-29 21:20:11	@John_France @ClaroRonaldo what a man. And what a man you are!

35542190	shane_case	2014-02-01 19:44:08	Optimus Alive looks like a great overseas festival option this year

35542190	shane_case	2014-01-31 22:10:21	“@Football__Tweet: Fulham defender Philippe Senderos has joined Valencia on a permanent deal. #FFC #DeadlineDay” HOW????
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-01 13:01:08	Id be happy with a qpr win as long as @OfficialFOXES do the business today. Early days but surely that would make it a 2 horse race.
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-01 14:09:55	Perfect opportunity for @OfficialFOXES to capitalise.
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-01 14:10:25	United's side looks tasty all of a sudden!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-01 14:12:22	Love the championship.. Opposition players awarding MOM to each other is a nice touch

35542190	shane_case	2014-02-02 17:31:39	@sam88max I'd like to see John Rambo grab Harry Potter by the neck and squeeze until his little head pops off
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-02 17:32:33	Good to hear the Ox is back

35542190	shane_case	2014-02-02 17:38:49	@sam88max haha. I'm now picturing you with a bow and arrow in place of John Rambo on my tele. God that would make good tv
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-02 17:40:25	@OzHotham you make me sick sometimes. We are voting to take your patch away tomorrow
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-02 17:44:13	@sam88max I'd have your back mate. I no every Rambo move in the book

35542190	shane_case	2014-02-03 20:28:37	@RossTC21 @PJakeGallagher That's a really disturbing combo
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-03 20:48:03	Credit to Jose. Chelsea look like a powerful machine tonight

35542190	shane_case	2014-02-05 13:02:21	@PJakeGallagher @LeeRHDavey pretty sure the strike and riot was in year 4 :)

35542190	shane_case	2014-02-15 13:46:01	Mario Balotelli's goal last night. #Worldy
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-16 16:03:41	How long has Andy Gray been back then?
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-16 16:17:44	@Liam90 Liverpool vs Arsenal
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-19 12:44:17	@AdeWilt13 I reckon you are a secret United fan ;)
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-16 17:20:16	Liverpool deserved that. Been all Liverpoolin the 2 half... The ox is the only bright spark for arsenal
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-16 17:25:16	How is that not a penalty. That has to the most blatant pen I've ever seen. Shocking decision. Do we question match fixing in England?
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-16 17:25:54	@Arsenal_reeview @Angexxb pen all day
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-16 17:29:21	@Angexxb @Arsenal_reeview Fergie must of Recommended Wenger to him in the wake of his retirement :)
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-16 18:27:32	@Besty240481 @scottsmith1980 That decision was so bad it should result in a ban.
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-16 18:32:00	@Besty240481 @scottsmith1980 Liverpool were far the better team. Just one of those day.
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-16 18:35:02	@scottsmith1980 @Besty240481 Who was it? I missed the last 5
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-16 18:35:49	Just seen the Reading result... Get in. Great weekend for Leicester.
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-16 18:38:35	@Besty240481 @scottsmith1980 I thought he had a good game. I'm a big fan of the ox.. Sturbridge was off his game a little today...
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-19 23:00:22	“@Roberto1311: One direction are fucking idiots!” Amen to that brother
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-19 23:02:04	@Football__Tweet This just shows he's the 3rd laziest out of the 4 Arsenal midfield players
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-19 23:03:12	@GenoWarr Not as cool as Alex Turner :)
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-19 23:07:01	'Rock 'n 'roll will never die... And there's nothing you can do about it. See you in the summer Mr Turner

35542190	shane_case	2014-02-23 15:34:47	@JessGiff_ I'm starting to realise that... Maybe I'll make up for it with a take away later!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-22 10:31:53	Baines 2 score 1st at 25/1 is certainly worthy of my free bet with @SkyBet
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-22 10:33:46	Leicester, Orient, Chesterfield and Preston for a naughty little 4 fold..
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-22 10:58:07	@LRidge18 I haven't won a 5 fold for 4 weeks so I've reverted back to the 4 to see how I go :)
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-22 11:23:05	@Moisy_6 yeah I fancied Hazard and if it was my money I would of backed him. But 25/1 for a free bet is tasty

35542190	shane_case	2014-02-23 10:01:56	@6Lkf I love the man... People who think he isn't a top top player lack huge understanding on football.
35542190	shane_case	2014-02-23 10:04:04	@OzHotham haha what a strike. Barca lost as well which made me happier yesterday. Did you see the Hamburg free kick??

35542190	shane_case	2014-04-01 20:53:17	“@JoeCharlton6: Don't remember what losing feels like #lcfc nearly there. Gunna do knee slides up muddy rec when it happens.” I'm joining
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-01 20:55:55	@JoeCharlton6 I fancied it at the start of season mate and they are delivering... I'm already thinking about European football in 2016 :)

35542190	shane_case	2014-04-07 09:48:04	@87bowers @olliewake God I love #woktowalk
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-06 15:49:59	That's a foul all day... Carroll is a rugby player. If he's in brazil this summer it better be for a holiday
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-07 18:49:47	Fancy a Sunderland upset tonight
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-07 18:51:34	@strutt1987 You must be Devo Alan ... 21-1
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-13 12:45:16	Great goal... Touch of class from Sterling
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-13 12:53:27	Sterling is unplayable here...
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-13 12:54:30	Stevie G is looking like a decent CB
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-13 13:04:48	Loving this...
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-13 13:06:22	City are in trouble when Suarez starts playing
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-13 13:11:16	@paulipearbear01 Nice Paulie
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-13 14:07:55	Kompany showing he's probably the best CB in the world?
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-13 14:31:18	Sterling... Man of the Match for me 👏
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-13 14:34:09	I hope i see Stevie G lift the trophy... What a player, what a man
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-13 12:36:13	That was incredible #Anfield #NeverWalkAlone
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-13 12:36:32	Come on Liverpool
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-13 12:59:28	Navas vs Stevie G in a tackle... Don't bother Jesus
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-13 14:00:02	Can't believe I'm saying this but what a difference James Milner has made... Yes James bloody Milner
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-10 14:39:15	@RossTC21 oh you ran the @LondonMarathon did you?? 1st I've heard about it 😁
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-16 09:59:09	@OzHotham @Squawka @SkyBet only need 240 2 complete. I think panini forgot to make the Dutch players.. Swaps anyone?? http://t.co/l4iqLcGPcW

35542190	shane_case	2014-04-16 17:49:01	Narine on fire #IPL
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-16 20:53:42	Really want Liverpool to win the league but I've got a feeling Mr Mourinho will upset the party
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-16 21:10:38	@JamieGreen1988 come on.. You boys have enough trophies. Let Stevie G have this one
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-17 06:45:10	@seanyads @JamieGreen1988 Couldn't agree more... Rogers is a top manager. You've got some good young English player and Stevie is a god!!!!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-17 14:09:18	@olliewake @OzHotham @henrygayle @KP24 Not watching
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-17 14:09:43	@olliewake @OzHotham @henrygayle @KP24 actually still got @imVkohli out there
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-19 09:06:35	Ghana complete... @harroldo16 can we negotiate swaps. This is starting to cost me a fortune http://t.co/gOE49tKDwF
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-19 11:40:25	@kschmeichel1 just deals with corners!!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-19 11:46:49	Love the tackles you can make in the championship compared to the prem... If Onuoha jumps in like that in the prem there's calls for a red
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-21 21:16:53	@olliewake Ryan Giggs :)
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-21 21:19:19	@olliewake yeah def until the end of the season... Should of got Jose in the 1st place...
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-19 18:35:11	Massive week for Liverpool... If they win tomorrow surely it's all over.. NWA will sound incredible when the trophy is in Gerrard's hands
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-19 18:38:32	Surely Borini will get a PL winners medal if Liverpool win the league.
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-19 18:46:03	@johnshortland I know... I meant because he scored the winner against you today... Could be the most important goal a liv player scores
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 19:26:18	Bet the Leicester vs Bolton game is more entertaining than this
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 20:05:42	Huge long throw that 😂
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 20:06:01	Come on @OfficialFOXES

35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 20:22:14	Leicester!!!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 20:26:56	Rangers... Don't piss me off
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 20:28:46	“@LucyB_xxx: For those who didn't see Lloyd Dyers goal... #LCFC https://t.co/cV4YKeQJgA” What a hit
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 20:30:00	Rangers are 49 points and 85 goals better than Ayr but when I put a bet on they seem to be equal
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 20:30:52	Scrap that... Yes Rangers!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 20:32:53	20 mins away from the title
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 20:45:10	Glad the Leicester game isn't on tele... Tense last 5 mins
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 20:48:32	@zoecochrane3 Look... I have been waiting 10 years this... 😃
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 20:52:29	Finally #Champions
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 20:54:24	Not even apologising for all the Leicester tweets!
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 21:08:25	@mattyegancorby wish we were together 2 celebrate this one!
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 21:09:57	@mattyegancorby that would be the dream :)
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 21:12:57	@87bowers @TSBible What??? When?
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-22 21:16:01	@87bowers @TSBible Well congratulations to them.. Not that bothered really!! 😜 http://t.co/y59rM7o5i1
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 08:25:23	Can't wait to see Shola Ameobi dominate at the World Cup this summer
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 08:26:32	That is how you attack a corner
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 08:28:50	Top pen #MOTD
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 08:37:08	@samualkendall He is saving himself for the World Cup mate.. Bit like RVP.. #Shola4GoldenBoot
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 08:38:25	@87bowers sorry m8. I was having a BBQ with fam.. Really gutted as painting your fence is exactly what I fancied doing on my bank holiday😋
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 08:40:40	@samualkendall You can imagine my excitement when I got him in my pack yesterday http://t.co/k4Z5IcQetl
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 08:47:00	@samualkendall they are all yours my friend #Shola4GoldenBoot
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 08:47:44	@87bowers oh really? I'm a bit busy today.. Washing my hair mate! Wanna come down mine tomorrow and help me pull my weeds up??
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 09:03:55	@87bowers your not doing that?
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 09:42:12	@smudge_smith @87bowers haha you can fucking do it
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 11:00:05	What a job Rogers has done... Look at that squad in comparison to Chelsea's and Man City... Aspas and Alberto as back ups!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 11:05:50	If only Rogers was in charge of England this summer
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 11:10:47	Liverpool are playing without fear. Almost total football at the moment
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 11:11:02	Class
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 11:12:53	@CraigWood_ They are looking top class... If Hodgson doesn't get Sterling in the behind the strikers for England he should be shot
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 11:15:51	Just watched @OfficialFOXES highlights... #NugeNugeNuge #NugentForEngland
35542190	shane_case	2014-04-20 11:21:54	@CraigWood_ did you see the subs bench for Liverpool? Amazing what he's done. I'm too excited for the World Cup

35542190	shane_case	2014-05-21 17:39:28	@sam88max I agree with that... Couldn't have a better man in charge..

35542190	shane_case	2014-06-03 07:29:25	@olliewake I think we should start a campaign to get @BumperGraham Barca book on the national school curriculum.

35542190	shane_case	2014-06-04 21:00:19	I was led to believe that was a World Cup warm up game. If that was the case then why were we watching 2 players that aren't going play?
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-04 21:18:19	@olliewake would have 2 up top in Rooney and Sturridge. You could then get Barkley or sterling in the hole.. I'm worried wakey boy!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-04 21:21:30	@olliewake the assist for lambert was class but his 1st touch in that move was lucky! We will discuss tomorrow night.. Hodgson worries me
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-04 21:43:02	@JamieGreen1988 no time for kind gestures in international management.. Spain have just cut 2 prem league winners after 2 weeks of training!

35542190	shane_case	2014-06-04 21:01:28	@olliewake Rooney on the left??
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-04 21:17:11	@olliewake to slip the striker in. I'd still play the diamond.. Gerrard in the 'pivote' 😃 role.. FB turn into wingers when attacking. We ..
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-04 21:23:16	@olliewake Exactly.. Gerrard should be starting every attack from deep.. Ox, JW, Barkley, Lallana, sterling can all play in that system
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-04 21:26:16	@zoecochrane3 @olliewake This is a very serious matter Cochrane. If you could just google World Cup rules for Girlfriends and stick to them👌
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-04 17:04:31	Think costs will be a massive signing for Chelsea. Jose is creating a powerful unit once again..
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-04 21:15:19	@olliewake do you think? I don't think he can start. He's exciting but his decision making let him down. He failed with 2 easy passes ..
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-04 21:20:16	Lampard was so far of the pace in tonight's game! Ox was our best player. We should be playing the diamond. Defence is a worry.
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-07 09:02:00	Brazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany to reach the semi finals 20-1.. Very tasty
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-07 09:24:01	@johnshortland you reckon? Could you elaborate?
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-07 09:36:40	@johnshortland fair one.. They consistently       reach the latter stages and @ 20/1 I couldn't resist a sneak 10 quid bet
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-07 09:37:18	@johnshortland I don't fancy portagul to qualify :).
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-07 09:43:15	@johnshortland the odds for that will be huge.
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-07 09:49:54	@johnshortland Jesus.. I'd take that

35542190	shane_case	2014-06-17 21:16:43	@Murpho14 you know it :)
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-16 16:31:56	@charvine19 deal!! It's waiting for you in the freezer
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-16 16:32:49	@johnshortland the Germans impressing you?
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-16 16:35:13	@johnshortland it's alright pal. I'll let you off. Did you see my howler with Spain 😂
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-17 04:28:40	Woke up 2 another winner... Always 2-1 @PJakeGallagher http://t.co/j6HHMD8Ec8
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-17 07:13:16	Happy bday @yhiggins1 Love you xxx
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-16 16:38:21	@johnshortland 3 - 0 Spain win, Spain to win the World Cup, basically called Spain were unbeatable haha
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-16 16:39:03	Pepe is a liability... Portugal won't make it through the group!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-16 16:41:15	The Portuguese are rougher than Honduras
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-16 16:45:47	Easy
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-16 17:05:05	@johnshortland haha I have had done lovely bets so far. Very profitable World Cup
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-18 19:24:08	@JoeCharlton6 easy pal
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-18 19:24:32	“@olliewake: Casillas is all over the place again! #headsgone” Agree... Just stay on your feet man
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-18 19:27:23	Iniesta is going to have to this on his own by the looks of it
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-18 19:37:54	Silva slows the game down way too much
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-18 20:12:43	Why has Sergio Ramos just taken a free kick
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-18 20:30:40	Can only see another chilie goal
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-18 20:42:40	@olliewake very impressed with Vidal!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-18 20:43:56	Just 2 let everyone know... China have beaten Macedonia 2-0 today. Cracking little side
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-18 20:45:05	Does this mean we are better than Spain?
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-18 20:52:54	Chile can go all the way in this tournament!
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-18 20:54:42	Brazil wouldn't fancy chile in the next round
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-18 21:02:37	Rio, Henry and Seedorf 👍
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-16 19:41:59	“@charvine19: Love this little dude #gorgeous http://t.co/8PmscWcjbM” @yhiggins1 he is way too cool!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-17 17:53:24	@PJakeGallagher I'm a little gutted I haven't had a bet on every one of them. I'm going Neymar FGS and of course 2-1 to brazil tonight
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-17 17:54:00	@PJakeGallagher yet another 2-1 always 2-1 Never not 2-1
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 14:29:06	Im getting nervous.. #ComeOnEngland
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 20:00:02	@RossTC21 I agree with the Baines call
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 20:02:32	@RossTC21 mate you can't ignore individual mistakes
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 20:03:26	@RossTC21 if you fuck up for me next year, you'll be hearing about it.. I won't be blaming the team 😃
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 20:04:47	@RossTC21 yeah I agree.. 3 defenders
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 20:06:03	@RossTC21 shall I not single Baines out for that either?
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 20:43:21	Sunday morning defending...
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 20:57:10	Easy 2 say now but Gerrard wouldn't even attempted that header if JT was at the back
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 21:13:36	@JLSmeeton88 haha, which one was that? I've had 4 good winners so far.. With my betting that's about a 20% win rate 😃
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 21:14:04	How can that voice inspire a team
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 21:45:07	So poor from Jagielka
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 21:56:29	@olliewake me... Need to watch some decent football
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 21:58:19	@olliewake no money on this one but of course I'm predicting 2-1... I don't know who will be in the final but it will be won 2-1
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 17:34:00	That shoreline again
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 07:18:34	@CraigWood_ what you talking about then? God I hate a hidden message 😃
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 07:19:25	@Murpho14 well if in doubt, you no what to do... 2-1, 2-1, 2-1 👍
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 07:19:59	@CraigWood_ oh the old switch-a-roo @ work? Good luck mate
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 07:21:01	@Murpho14 I'm just gonna have to cover them all.. 6 bets @ 2-1 haha.. I'm kidding about England, we will dominate and win with ease 😁
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 19:48:57	@LeeRHDavey not good enough
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 19:58:13	@LeeRHDavey I think he's very protected at Everton.. He's being found out here.. This is so frustrating
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 19:59:28	@mrackham14 can't blame Rooney there. Jagielka is not tight enough, Baines didn't cover and Johnson gave Canvani too much space
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 21:15:46	@JLSmeeton88 haha that was optimistic I must admit. How about Messi and 7-0 for the Iran game ;)
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 21:17:48	Suarez has gone from 66/1 to 12/1 for THS in the space of 2 hours
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 21:59:00	@olliewake that's not a bad frickin idea mate
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 16:05:31	Mark Lawrenson really has turned into a miserable old bastard
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 17:07:59	Lugano out, Suarez in! Im not sure what's worse for England.. Whoever is replacing Lugano has to be a better defender
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 20:32:18	Lucky Rooney wasn't back defending then
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 21:00:41	Hoddle is pure football... Bring him back and let him coach these youngsters
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 21:06:18	@johnshortland glad people agree... He has such great ideas on shape and formations.. Im sure he'd improve England
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 21:18:17	“@OptaJoe: 2 - England have lost their opening two games of a World Cup for the first time ever. Humbled. #ENGvsURU” and we r praising them!
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-19 21:59:33	@samualkendall @johnshortland he's got absolutely nothing on Shola
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-20 09:15:39	@Roberto1311 god yeah... Love the Courteeners ...
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-20 09:16:35	@RossTC21 @Roberto1311 This excites the shit out of me
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-20 09:19:00	@MattNewens why hello yellow one. Welcome back to the country. I'm gonna need dates when your home cause your playing for me nxt season :)
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-20 11:04:43	@MattNewens @RossTC21 @Roberto1311 any one up for jack white, Nov 19th at the O2??
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-23 21:21:51	Chile will beat brazil!
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-26 14:03:07	Suarez is a complete tool'
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-26 14:03:53	@CraigWood_ @luis16suarez i agree but it's a good decision as it means he can't appeal and therefore can't play in the World Cup
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-26 14:05:03	United meet the release clause of Ander Herrera but Athletico turn it down any way. 😂
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-26 14:06:01	@CraigWood_ @luis16suarez I'm not sure. Getting this info from Talk sport. If it was longer he could have appealed and been eligible for sat
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-26 14:35:56	@CraigWood_ @luis16suarez @FIFAcom haha Blatter had nothing to do with it
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-25 16:52:39	@87bowers and to think @sam88max and @OzHotham doubting my selection.. 7/1 for greatest player to ever live to be TGS.. #LikePrintingMoney
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-25 16:58:26	@87bowers @sam88max @OzHotham TBF he's not been bad. However they will be out in the next round whereas Messi will feast upon Algeria :)

35542190	shane_case	2014-06-28 12:15:45	Paolo Nutini's set at glasto yesterday was incredible... Being in the crowd for Iron Sky must have been a moment
35542190	shane_case	2014-06-28 12:16:57	@CraigWood_ Jesus christ, what music channels do you watch?? haha. are you running on time?

35542190	shane_case	2014-06-30 17:35:45	Pogba is too good
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-01 18:28:44	Yes... Dream team points :)
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-01 21:59:36	Gutted for USA
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-04 09:07:18	@LeeRHDavey @RossTC21 @Roberto1311 I've gone for the Cardiff gig mate
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-04 09:19:52	@RossTC21 @LeeRHDavey @Roberto1311 I've got a busy November mate so the B'mouth gig was impossible
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-03 11:20:16	@KennyJBowers @sam88max I've suggested that he should be let back.. I wanted more of a fuss made

35542190	shane_case	2014-07-08 20:26:14	What a lesson
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-08 20:28:48	I love the Germans... Kroos is a complete Baller in the middle
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-08 20:31:54	I'd feel sorry for the Brazil fans if I wasn't a English fan!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-08 20:35:44	“@doctorfollowill: This is crazy. I changed 1 diaper &amp; came back to a 5-0 score. Germany aren't playing around.” 😂😂
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-08 20:36:53	@JamieGreen1988 thankfully you've already got close to 50m for Luis... Jose is pissing himself laughing somewhere
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-08 20:38:44	In my opinion Germany are doing this with 10 men as well as Ozil had been lightweight
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-08 20:40:27	@johnshortland can we go back to our pre World Cup tweets? I believe you and I had a conversation about Germany 😃
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-08 20:56:17	@johnshortland haha, I couldn't help my self
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-08 20:57:55	“@SundayChants: Luiz Felipe Scolari at half time after going 5-0 down:

"Don't worry lads. We've got the wind second half."” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-08 21:00:46	“@johnshortland: Klose is an absolute hero, does fuck all outside the box but a killer in the six yard box” reminds me of someone yard 😃
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-08 21:08:02	Mertesacker is going to gift Brazil a couple in this second half
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-08 21:34:59	What a finish
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-08 21:47:42	@olliewake that goal could of just cost me £60 in my dream team

35542190	shane_case	2014-07-30 14:35:51	@RossTC21 @GNev2 valid point but Scholes has already proven he's got the credentials. The comments about Wiltshire and Rooney for example1/2
35542190	shane_case	2014-07-30 14:41:05	@RossTC21 @GNev2 I do apologise for the rant. I just thought Paul Scholes was gone from my Saturdays forever!! It's a great day

35542190	shane_case	2014-09-02 10:11:32	“@87bowers: Bloody love this boy #BigBoy #GrowingUp http://t.co/yYlWAWUFjd” @yhiggins1 will melt
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-02 22:00:10	@jamiemanley76 @87bowers some players are willing to give up champs league football to play for great managers ;)
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-02 19:42:48	@87bowers @SundayChants @Pen_Mill_FC yeah that's the reason I wear it 😁
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-02 19:43:29	@PJakeGallagher @Dannycabs2 Good, Yeovil need a change
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-03 08:07:09	@Murpho14 @Sweeter1984 I saw that mate and yes without doubt Moore should of got hold of the ball.. The real problem however was that the...
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-03 08:08:18	@Murpho14 @Sweeter1984 ball was played to his head/chest 4 times in a row when there was three midfield players on the pitch who by the way
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-03 08:08:47	@Murpho14 @Sweeter1984 could not pass the ball 5 yards to save their lives.
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-03 08:11:35	@Murpho14 @Sweeter1984 Is Seth Nana actually a football player??
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-03 08:43:06	Like the look of the England team tonight!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-03 08:52:18	@olliewake hart, stones, jones, Cahill, Baines, ox, Wiltshire, Henderson, sterling, Rooney, Sturridge
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-03 08:53:11	@JUnderwood87 a lot of energy in midfield. Similar to what I give when playing 😁😁
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-03 08:54:41	Love football... Next 2 hours will be spent watching italian, French, Spanish, and German review shows :)
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-03 21:14:15	@SherborneTownFC Definitely!! After watching #YTFC last night and Sherbs tonight I can confidently state that Sherborne are the better team
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-03 07:52:10	@Sweeter1984 blame lies with management in my opinion.. Do you know the reasons behind Moore being subbed at half time sweeter?
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-03 07:57:55	@Sweeter1984 I agree he wasn't great but who had a good first half last night? Just didn't make any sense.. Long ball game continued with...
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-03 07:58:51	@Sweeter1984 three 5ft strikers... Coaching staff seemed quite content with our defenders lumping the ball forward.. #HorrorShow
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-03 08:02:25	@Sweeter1984 just needed to vent my frustrations :)

35542190	shane_case	2014-09-06 17:43:27	@MJohnmorgan1 @87bowers @Pen_Mill_FC showed his class with a lovely volleyed pass down the line as well.. Strikers just weren't ready for it
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-06 17:44:44	@AdeWilt13 just witnessed that my self.. Free shake with every kilo of white meat purchased I believe

35542190	shane_case	2014-09-08 19:01:21	Wiltshire needs to be on the ball at the start of every England move. Not touched it yet.
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-08 19:15:33	@87bowers is that you?? Have you lost 3 stone since I last seen you?? P.s save me some cake
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-08 19:19:06	@87bowers clearly Lewis needs to share some of that cake with you!!
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-08 20:10:05	I think this is the season in which Phil Jones will finally reach his football manager ability
35542190	shane_case	2014-09-08 20:36:59	Henderson, Cahill, Jones, Delph and Sterling have all been top tonight

35542190	shane_case	2015-02-24 20:21:03	For all Manchester City's money they still can't put out a side that's anywhere near the top European teams of our time. Youth systems work!
