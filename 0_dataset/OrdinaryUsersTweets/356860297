356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-05-30 18:23:31	Hope George does the business tomorrow. What a hero
356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-05-30 19:18:57	Did Andy Townsend think that was a good ball? I don't think he's mentioned
356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-05-30 19:19:48	Ps England are dreadful.
356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-05-30 19:31:15	The fact that that's a foul and a yellow card sickens me.
356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-05-30 19:52:33	Hoddle taking in absolute riddles #IThink
356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-05-30 20:07:20	Brooke's like an awful itch that refuses to go away. But not even a useful itch that lets you know something. Just an irrelevant one. Twat.
356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-05-30 20:12:31	@lilyysharratt yes but she forgets that she's an irrational fruit loop
356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-05-30 20:14:16	Also had no understanding of ownership. Just cause were 'family' I'm not obligated to share everything with you. Try buying summat yourself.

356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-06-02 21:40:41	Not sure I fully understand this 'too hot to sleep' logic. What do people in genuinely hot countries do? Roam streets all night o what?

356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-06-13 16:16:41	@Robshaw15 he is indeed. Who knows pal you could be right. He deffo went out on a limb saying the Mexico goal should have stood too #Brave

356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-08-20 19:16:18	@hanjax I did say good luck. Optimism kills a person, set yourself up to get set down. A pessimistic person will never feel let down

356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-08-30 13:22:45	Referees upset me
356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-08-30 13:24:22	Just have zero luck as a football club.
356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-09-01 20:18:19	Can't believe an actual boy in pub has turned off sky sports news on deadline day to put a music channel on, does he have no self respect?

356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-09-05 19:27:33	Football fans amuse me. A professional has just controlled the ball with no pressure on him and apparently that deserves a clap. Not for me
356860297	BaileyJackson2	2014-09-05 19:44:12	Sport commentators do my head in
