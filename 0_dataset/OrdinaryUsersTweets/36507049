36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-15 16:00:39	@mikeskupin what did you do in your tape? Do you think audition tapes have changed over the years?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-15 22:08:42	@MartyCaswell funny!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-15 22:53:20	@mikeskupin yeah flash over substance doesn't tell them who you are #Survivor Do you think the focus has changed over the years?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-15 22:54:34	@mikeskupin @JamesThuma Wow 20 vids? I wonder how early in the process they got a call back. That would seem to be motivating.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-16 19:04:20	@goofygal1171 Today I love my job :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-16 19:21:46	@robstaboobuzzer where've you been? You've been quiet.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 04:00:12	Jeff Probst to Laura B. "Do you belong out here?" Ouch!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 04:04:03	@ReneJHerrera Lol. Yeah tell that to Denise!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 04:06:12	Why was Monica Culpepper looking like she was going out on a dinner date at tribal council? #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 04:09:13	@ReneJHerrera @ChadKincaid1 @L_Ho_2012 I live out here in LA and haven't ever been :(
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 04:10:00	@mrsredsox0923 a little easy on the eyes ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 04:13:43	@vytasyoga @Hayden_Moss You have a good way about you though. Yoga? Must practice if I get cast on the show ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 04:18:43	@ReneJHerrera 1. Have no clue how to get tix 2. Same as one. Though to be fair I've not tried hard
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 04:19:24	@ReneJHerrera btw, where's your boy #BUZZ? He ok?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 04:26:28	@ReneJHerrera Hmmm. Yeah I guess so. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 04:30:36	@ReneJHerrera Oh that's fun! I don't think it's easy to get tix, but  hanging out with other enthusiasts is a good choice.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 03:47:36	@mikeskupin do you agree with burning the clue each time?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 21:32:12	@TheRealAmandaZZ what deceptions are you referring to?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 21:33:35	@ReneJHerrera @mrsredsox0923 If you come out here let me know :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 22:36:19	Whatever happened to Thursday Throw Up day?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-15 21:08:05	@furiousnothing McCoy on Mathews outbounds "I can't repeat what I said on the sideline. That could have cost us the game."üíô his #notolerance
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 22:38:07	@ChadKincaid1 Good luck! I submitted mine a while ago. Have you ever gotten a call back?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 23:11:24	@alliepohevitz Congrats on your job out here. Do you really have to watch the #Survivor vids? I figured it was some intern in a basement.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 23:25:38	@FindMyNervous favorite movie as a kid
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-16 16:18:02	@goofygal1171 she is so incredibly cute there. She looks a lot like you. I think it's the eyes. And I see you have her "buff ready" early on
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-16 16:25:14	@JeffProbst Sent in my app. Did what you said (thank u) and added the other side to who I am and how I'd play. So hope I get a call back!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 20:10:39	@TysonApostol pats on the back all around
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 23:34:50	@FindMyNervous I started with the book too. I think I actually read the book before the movie was made... So I guess that dates me, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-17 23:35:49	@FindMyNervous and yeah I've seen the movie a thousand times. Haha
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-18 00:45:52	@alliepohevitz Really? I would love if you watched my vid. It's an intro into my character which is more complex than people would think.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-19 05:28:10	@kclark168 Here's looking at you kid. :) http://t.co/TEzwjFdUrf
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-19 16:28:20	Apparently I'm missing #Survivor this week when I fly out for our vacation. Who the hell scheduled this trip?!? Oops. Me :(
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-18 15:42:16	@meehand that's good cause I had some spells yesterday that were Dawn worthy :) Love you Dawn.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-18 15:44:01	@robstaboobuzzer where've you been? You ok?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-18 16:43:30	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer Ha. Maybe. But wanted to make sure BUZZ is ok even at the expense of boosting his ego, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-18 17:42:19	If missing a dose of your medication causes a night of para psychotic dreams and hallucinations, that's one f'ed up medication.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-20 04:56:29	@ongeface @Survivor_Tweet I hear ya. It hurts.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-20 06:12:19	@jodiwincheski @google @gmail is it that way on different devices or computers?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-18 20:04:45	@TheRealAmandaZZ @Towncentermall Ha. You dragged him there, huh?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-20 16:54:27	@robstaboobuzzer who was here first. You or Robs Podcast Bell?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-20 16:56:29	@robstaboobuzzer I was just curious. Never seen him before and of course thought of you ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-20 17:40:29	Are #Chargers LT's made of glass?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-22 17:38:38	Kickin' ass and takin' names! Blam!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-19 00:07:47	@goofygal1171 I hope she checks it out. I would love to hear her thoughts. #CouldBeInteresting
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-19 01:11:28	@goofygal1171 Ha. Yeah, I wasn't sure either. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-20 18:27:34	@UTKevinAcee yeah making those penalties hurts them in no way. It should be where the secs are put back on the clock
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-20 18:30:22	@MartyCaswell Jags D just had to commit penalties and it only hurt us.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-20 18:31:25	@UTKevinAcee Rivers must have had big eyes. I get it, but still kinds stings.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-21 16:18:39	@goofygal1171 On Wed night will be flying to NY. Will wave hi to you as we go over your home! :) Missing #Survivor tho :( #badscheduling
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-20 17:51:19	@MartyCaswell new concussion or aggravate old one?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-20 19:43:50	@UTKevinAcee exactly! Now 84.7 would be acceptable. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-21 01:06:21	@teetomterrific so is it worth it to watch that show if I don't care about zombies?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-21 00:45:46	@DjFluker76 Great game! I love your heart and so happy you're a Charger. ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-21 03:42:01	@GirlPakProds Thanks! Why Reseda? Yay lunch. After Dex and I get back from New York :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-21 05:37:26	@teetomterrific it's on Netflix. Trying to decide if I want another show.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-21 05:37:46	@teetomterrific or if it will give me nightmares, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-21 19:30:52	@goofygal1171 Haha. No spitting. Yes, traveling for fun. Post bday vacation :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-23 17:30:43	Much needed vacation. NYC here I come!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-23 21:03:11	@alliepohevitz Hey, sorry if you're asked this all the time, but was wondering if casting has started making calls or when they will start?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-24 03:43:28	The red eye crowd is a bit different than the morning crowd. #lax
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-24 19:34:34	@JeffProbst So does this mean you won't be casting a newbies without Ioved ones season? Hope that's not true.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-28 01:52:53	@JeffProbst @MrJonCryer @aplusk How fun!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-29 01:35:11	@jerrimanthey without looking at the link I'm thinking ink sack ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-28 14:30:38	@GirlPakProds @robcesternino How many #RHAP podcasts can I listen to on the flight home from NY to LA? Hmmm
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-29 03:44:46	@GirlPakProds @robcesternino The Abi Maria and Fincher set me up for the flight. :) (NY was great.)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-29 03:48:55	@GirlPakProds Lol. That is funny.  We did discuss your meeting up with Baker... Just didn't realize the 2 Matts.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-30 06:40:35	@jerrimanthey have you been to Ink? Definitely out of the box eats.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-30 15:33:30	@teetomterrific have a safe, smooth trip!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-31 03:32:24	@Hayden_Moss @KatEdorsson Love your sincerity. You're a good guy :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-31 03:47:38	@goofygal1171 well I am trained to work with couples and families and half of them are out here in LA... #survivortherapy hmmm
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-31 04:01:58	Oh my. Lessons on how NOT to play #Survivor by Laura B.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-31 04:22:09	@vytasyoga it was crazy. Saved you though :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-31 04:27:08	@goofygal1171 @Josh86755 not good to work with someone who's unpredictable. You never know what else they might do to screw things up.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-31 23:52:19	@goofygal1171 So if this tweet comes to me at 3am, then that means you are up at 5am?!? Insane! Do you ever run out of energy?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-10-31 23:54:06	@TheRealAmandaZZ not to be all serious on you, but totally normal response. And it will take time.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-03 18:52:17	@UTKevinAcee what is his problem? Pissing me off. Put in TuTu if VB isn't ready to play.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-03 18:58:22	@RolloverSports @UTgehlken @UTKevinAcee Uh, the announcers explained that Brown broke off his route. Not supposed to. VB's fault.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-03 20:18:55	@MartyCaswell Surprised there hasn't been more mistakes like that for him. Still hurts when it happens though.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-01 19:38:40	@KatieCollinsSur @johnscholle @SayGerv Funny. What made you all decide she was going then?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-03 21:50:41	@MartyCaswell I hate this loss but have you already forgotten how painful the Norv years were? Plenty of sick losses to rival this one.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-03 21:51:45	@UTgehlken agree. Can't fathom why we don't try those a couple times in a row. #frustrated
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-02 01:57:24	@AndyHerren @TheRealAmandaZZ @mccraechum a modern Breakfast Club
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-02 02:35:50	@jerrimanthey what's your take on Sprinkles? I'm not a fan, though they look pretty.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-02 17:43:28	@ReneJHerrera @mrsredsox0923 what do you do for work?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-02 17:56:22	@ReneJHerrera @mrsredsox0923 Cool. Do you work for a company or freelance?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-04 03:43:05	@ChadKincaid1 I might try to volunteer for a day
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-04 03:48:01	@ChadKincaid1 yeah I'd really like to go. And it's on my coast :) Are you gonna go?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-04 03:52:23	Ever notice there's really no such thing as a "good" loss. No matter how it happens fans feel sick and angry and want to someone to blame.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-04 04:04:26	@teetomterrific fans want to win now. No patience even in the face of facts. There's a lack of perspective &amp; A LOT of misplaced anger.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-04 04:05:12	@teetomterrific tho. I get it. Losing just feels bad. There can only be one winner so it happens to most at 1 point or the other
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-04 04:05:55	@ChadKincaid1 Awesome. Sounds like it could be fun.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-04 17:20:05	@mikeskupin @mshea129 which "battle" do you like the most of the 3 you mentioned?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-04 04:12:29	@teetomterrific I definitely think group success feeling as it's ones own success. It's also an admiration of greatness, community...
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-04 04:13:25	@teetomterrific you ever watch the Olympics? Seeing the competitive spirit, the fight? Even the pride of watching the US team?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-04 04:16:39	@teetomterrific I'll tell u tho, it sux when you're mood can be "tweaked" cause your team loses. Definitely something powerful in that. Ha.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-04 04:23:21	@teetomterrific Yep, it's definitely illogical. I've often wondered about it since I fall victim to it. Tho I have some perspective. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-04 22:18:06	@EddieRoyalWR we do too, but you guys keep fighting and the future looks bright.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-04 22:20:17	@UTgehlken I like him for the most part, but isn't it his job to look at what works and what doesn't? That involves questioning plays.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-05 04:46:13	@ReneJHerrera more than Cutler?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-05 04:50:58	@ReneJHerrera true. A win's a win. Take it :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-06 17:20:06	@GirlPakProds excuse me? Well I hate pecan pie.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-07 00:14:22	@GirlPakProds well I agree with you on that. Preferably dark.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-07 04:32:55	Oh Vytas you know what happens if you get too cocky. #Survivor 101
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-07 05:02:47	@ReneJHerrera I don't think she likes it when things don't go her way.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-07 05:03:33	@goofygal1171 we know you do :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-07 05:06:50	@SurvivorPenner if I ever get on the show I'm gonna use that info :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-07 05:07:13	@vytasyoga at least you admit it :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-07 23:56:33	@ReneJHerrera you don't mind if I call you freak do you? Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-08 00:04:59	@ReneJHerrera I haven't actually seen it yet. Have you?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-11 00:47:46	@MartyCaswell red zone woes, terrible secondary, lack of pass rush, and beat up line. Just tip of the iceberg.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-11 00:53:33	@teetomterrific Crazy. Why do you hate satellite? Do they have DSL or fiber optics?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-11 01:01:24	@robstaboobuzzer @mrsredsox0923 @TheGameSurvivor Oh my. I wonder if anyone has known about this? So very sad. I hope he's getting treatment.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-09 00:50:03	@teetomterrific what's for dinner?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-11 02:29:28	@ReneJHerrera Haha. What about the shoe differential?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-11 02:46:54	@teetomterrific I would die. Seriously. What are you going to do?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-11 04:10:29	@teetomterrific Ha. Sounds like a true #survivor ;) And why not satellite?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-11 16:48:56	@realityblurred @HollywoodDebi I assume they set him up for treatment. I truly hope he sticks with it. Even so dire, he can recover.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-11 16:52:31	@HollywoodDebi @realityblurred No, unfortunately it's not. So terrible.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-08 17:34:56	@meehand did you send a baby pic of him bathing too? The one two punch ;) Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-08 19:04:46	@robstaboobuzzer @FiligirlFu I was pissed that I had a google profile to begin with. It I didn't sign up it meant I didn't want it
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-09 01:06:00	@teetomterrific perfect! Making me hungry.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-09 20:43:43	Tolerating the suck.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-09 20:45:26	@mikeskupin @mickfaxis @thegodofawl it's all about telling a story. Beginning, middle and end.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-12 07:24:31	@FindMyNervous Hey. Been watching Sunny in Philadelphia. Season 2 has me sold. Love when they got "addicted" to crack! Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-12 22:04:05	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera @Bhara99 @Hawk_941 @stephenfishbach  I'm Amanda as well. Guess she's popular.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-12 23:01:39	@FindMyNervous Ah. He's a love.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-12 23:25:04	@ChadKincaid1 Yep. He will need continued support. Tough road.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-12 23:26:00	@UTKevinAcee @pdiddu Has he ever made it through a full season. It is a shame.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-12 23:31:31	@ChadKincaid1 back at ya
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-13 00:51:28	@ChadKincaid1 meaning me too. I've been down that road ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-13 00:53:05	@teetomterrific Lol. You're funny. I thought you weren't even gonna try them. FYI, I have them but weather isn't an issue usually
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-13 00:58:25	@teetomterrific what did they say?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-13 18:33:07	@goofygal1171 @gelogallardo That's probably the only time you've said you wish you lived in CA. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 00:22:02	@TinaWesson Uh oh. Very suspicious timing on joining twitter tonight Tina. Welcome :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 00:23:06	@jodiwincheski bummer for those people.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 00:23:57	@jodiwincheski if your next call for casting is to me, I'll forgive you ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 02:06:49	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera uh oh. Look out streets of LA.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 02:11:37	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer please do. It's better for everyone.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 02:15:48	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer frightening I'm sure. Those sketchers are really scary.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-17 02:49:32	@goofygal1171 Hi, I still hope your fingers are crossed cause I'm not ready to give up. Not until the fat (or skinny) lady sings ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-17 03:09:47	@FindMyNervous watching your show again. Dee and Dennis Have a New Dad. 8 min in and cracking up. Ridiculous abs brilliant at the same time.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-17 04:15:46	@TinaWesson Tina I see you figured out the twitter reply! Good job. Now battle your but off on RI and beat those boys ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-17 04:27:23	@mikeskupin How hard was it 2 have gotten called those times for Survivor and then plans changed? U want to play again. R u ok if you don't?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-17 05:04:44	@goofygal1171 Lol! You're the best. Made me :) Just don't hurt yourself on my account, hehe
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 04:21:29	@GirlPakProds she got the ultimate from Jeff. Not many get called by their last names unless you're the other Culpepper. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 04:43:03	@GirlPakProds Switching vote may seem harmless, but not a smart move by Brad's wife. Lol. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 05:08:04	@TinaWesson Darn. Bummed it was your night. Love that you're still feisty.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 05:09:56	@goofygal1171 @vytasyoga Denise it seemed you were able to keep your mouth shut most of the time, except with Abi and that didn't hurt u
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 05:11:03	@mikeskupin @SayGerv or just the wisdom of any #survivor enthusiast :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 05:13:01	@JeffProbst Can't wait to play Jeff. Antsy here on the couch.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 05:25:57	@GirlPakProds I have no idea. When I'm out there I'll probably look leathery and wrinkled. She looks like she just got a facial
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 05:30:39	@GirlPakProds remember to add in a dose of paranoia.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 05:34:38	@GirlPakProds They want BvW tapes for casting. Since Dex won't do it, you can be my "sister" and submit a tape ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 05:38:30	@GirlPakProds See. Perfect. Let's do this! And yeah they're looking at their options I believe. Screws me tho :(
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 05:39:41	@JeffProbst Will you do another West coast live tweet in the future? Where's our love? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 05:47:18	@GirlPakProds you and I do have dark hair and fair skin. Hmmm
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 05:51:31	@GirlPakProds that would work. I wouldn't be a target ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-17 17:20:21	@TinaWesson Has funny. It's settled then. If I ever get to play with you, let's get the guys out :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-17 17:21:33	@mikeskupin Ha. Yeah it feels like a game just trying to get on. It can be frustrating but don't want to give up.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-17 19:11:15	@FindMyNervous Omg, yes. Dumpster Baby (DB) was hilarious.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 16:27:30	@goofygal1171 @vytasyoga Yes you're right. Tough stuff. Any slip up could cost you.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-18 20:28:49	@JeffProbst Jeff I'm so excited. Even though I'm still hoping to get a call, my bro is gonna do a tape with me for BvW. You'll love him!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 20:14:19	@TinaWesson For someone who just started twitter, it seems you dove in head first! Just don't get banned, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-14 20:34:07	@TinaWesson @ReneJHerrera Tina if you just hit reply that should do the trick.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-18 21:47:11	@robstaboobuzzer I haven't decided if I'm gonna watch just cause I might be a cry baby. Is it a gut wrencher?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-18 21:53:09	@robstaboobuzzer is meh mean, not that gut wrenching or don't watch? Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-18 21:54:54	@mrsredsox0923 @robstaboobuzzer yeah somehow I don't see daHubs breaking down and crying, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-17 21:49:04	@UTKevinAcee why is the D so sloppy and undisciplined?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-17 21:51:12	@UTKevinAcee All the above.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-17 22:33:23	@UTKevinAcee What could've been if even Chargers were half healthy. Telesco has his work cut out for him. #needdepth
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-18 22:37:58	@MartyCaswell That would've been a dream. I think we would've seen a very diff Mathews.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-18 00:06:49	@MartyCaswell These fans kill me. Rivers is not the problem here. Are they that short-sighted?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-16 17:45:53	@meehand I wonder why they didn't want him they season. Casting is a fickle bunch it seems.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-16 17:57:33	@GetOnSurvivor awesome on your evolution. Will you kick ass regardless if you get that call? Waiting for that call for me is driving me mad
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-18 02:10:59	@DjFluker76 This may be a tough year, but I am soooo happy your on my team!!! #Chargers
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-19 01:14:56	@MalcolmWHW between your diet and your affinity for booze, how do you not gain weight?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-15 05:49:38	@alliepohevitz how bout when you call I tell you all those I don't want to play the game like. We can mix it up.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-19 03:55:11	@mikeskupin Love your interaction with fans!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-19 04:12:39	I was gonna ask if I'm crazy that I spend more time reading survivor fb posts than my own feed, but I think I answered my question. #balance
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-19 04:27:49	@mikeskupin Aw thanks for following me :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-19 04:52:13	@MartyCaswell exactly! It felt like watching paint dry. Is he always like that win his team loses?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-18 04:34:50	@russkid @goofygal1171 @mikeskupin @eorlins Good for you they're just throwbacks. Straight outta silent film days. No more hamburglars! Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-19 17:06:44	@goofygal1171 @BrandonFederow2 What is this I've been seeing?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-19 17:18:33	@realityblurred I don't watch Dr. Phil, but I assume thats what his shows are like? Regardless, whatever it took to save Todd's life is good
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-19 23:21:25	@robstaboobuzzer then say it ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-22 01:31:13	@ReneJHerrera Russell? Geez.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-22 01:32:44	@ReneJHerrera yeah that's weird. Popularity contest?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-21 00:00:00	@MalcolmWHW you preachin to the choir
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-20 03:30:35	@DjFluker76 I believe it with you. Love, love your attitude.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-20 03:31:24	@ReneJHerrera ok so is that a joke or do you really piss people off?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-20 03:31:55	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer Your coming to my town. But I'm not afraid. Should I be?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-20 03:33:14	@mikeskupin @AndyBales Mike wishes it was scripted.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-20 03:51:31	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer Lol. You know there are far scarier people here than you two ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-20 03:52:11	@ReneJHerrera exactly! ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-20 04:23:06	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer Funny. Is that Saddle Ranch?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-20 04:24:02	@TinaWesson I fit that category. What's it about?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-20 04:57:55	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer Yep. Sounds about right.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-20 05:05:19	@ChadKincaid1 @ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer just boys being boys.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-20 05:57:04	@JeffProbst @GlennyfromtheB @DaltonRoss No one that goes by the last name of Hantz?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-21 03:31:00	@ChadKincaid1 what bullying was he doing? I don't follow him
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-21 03:48:34	@ChadKincaid1 ah. Rude.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-21 04:01:16	@ChadKincaid1 yuck. Vile. Good for you to unfollow.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-21 04:15:21	Well if I hadn't been spoiled by CBS, that truel might've been exciting. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-21 04:23:12	Omg. I just saw Caleb. I completely forgot he was out there. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-21 04:49:29	@monicaculpepper won again! Oops, I already knew that. Thank you CBS. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-23 03:28:40	@GirlPakProds @TheGroveLA there's Sees there? Yummy!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-23 03:33:07	@AshsDreamboard So tell me know this dreamboard works. If you believe it, it will come true. What if you're nervous it might not happen?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-21 05:13:50	@teetomterrific welcome to the dark side.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-23 05:42:56	@meehand that just makes an hungry. What's your secret Dawn?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-22 22:53:26	@mikeskupin @stupidmonkeyz @KeithLDixon @HaymakerHattie Yep. Common sense. Avoid all social media until you can watch.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-21 17:56:19	@JeffProbst Hi. In your interview with @DaltonRoss you say this is the best season in years, but I think Philippines is right up there too.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-23 02:49:10	@JeffProbst don't let the bastards wear ya down. I like to hear your point of view.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-20 19:24:25	@JeffProbst just thinking about playing the game with my brother got me emotional. Geez. Must be the crappy weather.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-20 20:18:11	@robcesternino Hey Rob I was wondering if you use google to record your vid podcasts? If so how do you get your quality? Mine = crap
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-20 20:21:04	@robstaboobuzzer Lol. Yeah, right, I'm trying to be like #RHAP I have a looong way to go.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-21 20:46:28	Sometimes obsession is actually a good thing. Right now, not so much. #NoPeaceOfMind
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-20 20:32:40	@teetomterrific u going through withdrawals?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-22 00:59:00	@mikeskupin @xtinasiesling @RupertBoneham Lol. Always Skupins advise. Don't suck.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-22 01:13:56	@jerrimanthey @JeffProbst @survivor_love @JonnyFairplay @SurvivorHall who came up with this hall of fame anyway? Is it legit?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-22 01:15:08	@jerrimanthey @JeffProbst All Jeff's children. Everyone wants to be special. Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-22 01:22:23	@ReneJHerrera How dare you! Lol. I just got on the social media bandwagon regarding survivor a year ago. Had no idea about this whole world.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-22 01:24:54	@ReneJHerrera always have read Dalton Ross. Been watching since ep 1. I wouldnt call myself a superfan. I've applied tho. Want to play bad.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-22 01:25:59	@JeffProbst @survivor_love @JonnyFairplay @jerrimanthey @hypeheist So would I! And I'd jump to play!!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-24 04:27:21	@TinaWesson you two look very cute :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-24 23:27:14	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer YES! Very different than #breakingbad, but definitely awesome. Love Don Draper.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-25 04:00:16	@DjFluker76 Hey! I think you deserved a nap ;) Great game!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-25 04:02:38	Wow. So they're getting their matchup after all. #NFL on Sunday Night.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-25 04:03:59	A tale of two halves #NFL
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-24 17:07:58	@robstaboobuzzer why don't you like the last season so far?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-24 17:09:00	@mrsredsox0923 keep watching
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-24 18:56:58	@robstaboobuzzer @mrsredsox0923 lol. That's how we all felt.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-24 19:20:21	@UTKevinAcee @randymac81 you know it's bad when we are missing Cason. Ugh.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-24 20:04:39	@UTgehlken @UTKevinAcee who is worse? Cox or Marshall? Or in this game Wright?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-24 20:15:12	@UTKevinAcee Seems like a couple of these calls are bs though?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-24 21:09:16	@UTKevinAcee Ronnie brown 2x up the middle? Damn it!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-22 01:29:56	@ReneJHerrera ugh from Fairplays suggestion? Everyone seems to have fun with it.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-27 20:39:08	@alliepohevitz what region do you watch? Is it across the states or one specific area?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-27 02:47:31	@MartyCaswell these things only happen to you, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 04:17:40	@mikeskupin the newbies next season will take the clues. Guarantee it.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 04:27:21	@ReneJHerrera young. She thinks she's more wise than the others.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 05:10:56	@LisaWhelchel @goofygal1171 yeah Denise how'd you do so well then? I'm with Lisa, if there was tape I could've won it from my couch ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 05:16:08	@goofygal1171 @mikeskupin @Isherrygwyn Were the guys that outlasted you small or did you just shoot down Mike's argument? Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 05:17:00	@goofygal1171 @mikeskupin nevermind. You just answered my question and highlighted my point ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 05:17:57	@TinaWesson She must've really wanted Vytas out. Crazy. But good for you!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 05:19:32	@vytasyoga I was actually surprised how blatant they allowed it to be. Wonder if they will try to stop that in future seasons.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 05:21:46	@goofygal1171 Exactly. Challenges in past seasons have more often favored men then women. It happens. #survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 05:25:17	@FindMyNervous Happy Thanksgiving to you!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 05:28:15	Gotta give props to @monicaculpepper. She's putting everyone to shame on those challenges. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 06:16:42	@SurvivorPenner well at least you're ready to feed me! What time should I come over ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 06:50:02	@JeffProbst Happy Thanksgiving to you too Jeff!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 15:42:17	@mikeskupin @pjones102 @dawnie506 But it's still up to you how you want to answer his questions.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 15:43:02	@teetomterrific You too Tom!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 15:44:06	@meehand happy thanksgiving Dawn. Have a great one.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 15:53:23	@GutULykaFish Happy Thanksgiving!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 16:05:33	@GutULykaFish @teetomterrific would that be a real blindside or just voting him out? Kids don't seem to know the diff these days.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 16:54:36	Off to San Diego. Gobble. Gobble.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 20:58:39	@TinaWesson Happy Thanksgiving to you!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 20:59:10	@mikeskupin Happy Thanksgiving. Congrats on your Lions win!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 21:00:32	@ReneJHerrera have a good one!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-28 22:10:24	@MartyCaswell how is that possible when there's Miami and Jags out there?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-02 02:01:23	@UTKevinAcee not that I disagree, but what would you like him to say?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-02 04:06:56	@goofygal1171 Everyone seems to watch this show. Am I missing out?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-02 21:37:44	@Yahoo Haven't received emails for hours and it's clearly widespread. Please fix!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-03 01:18:21	#yahoomail get your act together! No emails all day. Argh.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-03 04:46:45	@goofygal1171 Do you think someone would like it if they don't care about zombies. I know. Blasphemy.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-03 05:05:32	@SHOPTRM @mccraechum @TraceeM is the fight still going on?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-03 21:06:38	@alliepohevitz You couldn't have said it better. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-03 21:11:12	@TinaWesson my heart breaks for you and your family. there are no words. thinking of you.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-03 23:32:20	@KatieCollinsSur my heart breaks for you and your family. there are no words. thinking of you.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-04 02:44:44	@KatieCollinsSur I know. Sending you love.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-29 17:10:46	@teetomterrific indeed
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-04 18:28:03	@realityblurred It's alarming how cavalier they've been. I wonder what's behind it. Purpose or laziness? Annoying.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 00:01:44	@AshsDreamboard short memories. And he was on twice in short span of time.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 00:18:20	@vytasyoga Not west coast? Boo. How will you be watching the earlier feed?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-30 22:57:30	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer Well now I know how to spot you ;) #sharp
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-30 23:07:36	@mrsredsox0923 @ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer Cue Lionel Ritchie
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 04:05:11	@mikeskupin @TinaWesson yeah I have the same reaction.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 04:26:52	@ReneJHerrera @AshsDreamboard definitely a winners edit. Oops Gerv may disagree. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 05:00:30	Awesome tribal tonight. Loved watching @Hayden_Moss fight and @cieraeastin making a big move.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 05:06:59	@Hayden_Moss loved that exchange. I saw you on BB, but you've impressed me more on this season!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 05:09:11	@goofygal1171 keep avoiding CBS promos and you'll be spoiler free!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 05:16:12	@goofygal1171 @TysonApostol To go home (or RI) on rocks with immunity in bag... Phew. #dodgedabullet
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 05:19:43	@mikeskupin @StephGunther @CherylO45 @JEFFVARNER Why do you think that is Mike?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 05:21:15	@ReneJHerrera nice color scheme. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 05:22:41	@ReneJHerrera you would be able to wear it to the finale weekend.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 05:25:27	@robstaboobuzzer @robcesternino @SpradlinKim Ahem. Jealous.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 05:33:07	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer How many peeps do you have going on your #NoPrisoners tour?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 05:53:32	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer Ha yeah I like to spend my free time figuring out you guys, lol. Depending on your sched I could get a drink
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 06:00:07	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer I'll just get my limo driver to do all the work. You know we're all rich our here. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-11-30 18:35:15	FORCING myself to gym. Hard to get back after not going for a while. #sluggish #weakling lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 15:44:13	@goofygal1171 I had heard something about the rocks too. :( But, my boyfriend had NO idea so was completely surprised. It was awesome.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 15:47:31	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Yea I know you dont drink alcohol. A drink could mean coffee, tea :) I could see you boys depending where u r
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 16:03:25	@AshsDreamboard yep. How long have you been a #Survivor fan? I love that you are.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 19:03:04	@mikeskupin @frenchleigh Didn't you get hacked recently or was that someone else? It's happening to a lot of peeps. #changepassword
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 20:22:40	@mikeskupin @FitFluential the point where you see more white than green. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 20:32:41	I'm all for the cause and making our world better, but being accosted EVERY time I just need to get in and out of the store gets annoying.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 20:33:46	@ReneJHerrera really adorable.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 20:38:25	@BostonRob you coming out here to LA to pimp out your new book Rules Version II? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-05 23:09:31	@mrsredsox0923 @robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera yes. A bit scary.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-04 16:12:36	@meehand Are you trying to make me sick while I'm eating my breakfast? lol. Ick.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-06 16:38:55	@dribbleglass do you actually watch? I thought Deb and I were the only ones...
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-06 03:08:53	@AshsDreamboard Very cool. Have you ever wanted to be on it? Or was BB more your speed?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-06 03:10:23	@AshsDreamboard @ashleyiocco lol. Funny.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-06 03:33:13	@robcesternino yes it's cold to us here who have always been in SoCal, but what about you? Have you gone soft? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-06 22:22:26	@BostonRob reading this tweet while listening to you on #RHAP
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-06 18:24:26	@TinaWesson Such a lovely picture. Still sending love and good thoughts your way. &lt;3
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-07 17:41:04	So this is what's cold for us on the West. Brrrr! And NO I can't comprehend what is like to be below 10. #dontwannna http://t.co/Ekc1KA7Rxf
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-06 19:34:00	@dribbleglass Yep. I've applied. Maybe you'll see me out there ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-06 19:36:43	@mccraechum Seems like you have a crush now... Aside from @AMANDAZUCKERMAN
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-06 22:25:05	@mikeskupin @JessePBitch punishes them for not being able to make a decision. It works.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-08 07:24:40	@ReneJHerrera why oh why would you retweet David from Big Brother? Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-08 07:29:21	@ReneJHerrera Aha. I see that. But the crap that actually comes out his mouth... Eh. No resemblance. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-08 07:32:15	@GirlPakProds they know what's up. Next put in Pretty in Pink ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-08 07:37:32	@GirlPakProds What about Judd Nelson? Breakfast Club could be a good fit. Meow. Meow.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-08 07:38:25	@ReneJHerrera maybe you can get a pic with him in LA. Twitter says he'll be here.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-08 07:41:18	@ReneJHerrera do you go to the party?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-09 19:41:18	@mikeskupin @AmonOdinsMom This season seems to be the most watered down. Did they not think the families could handle it?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-09 19:41:45	@robstaboobuzzer white, black or purple?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-09 20:51:26	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Looking forward to the battle of the bros football teams tonight? #MNF
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-09 22:49:03	@meehand You mentioned Brandon Flowers a while back. Battle Born is an awesome album!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-07 06:24:07	@TysonApostol according to the edit I think you'll be fine in a little over a week :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 00:40:42	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer Damn. Neither would I! I'm never sad when the Cowboys lose. Sorry #buzz
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 02:55:31	@ChadKincaid1 hope you're having a good one.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 03:02:22	@ChadKincaid1 No. Too far. Gonna try to volunteer for reality rally this April though.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 03:08:09	@ChadKincaid1 you going? What about #RealityRally?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-08 17:04:44	@BostonRob Gates had a terrible game last week. Look for him to respond this week
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-08 17:19:39	Just started watching The Walking Dead. It reminds me a little of Lost.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 06:47:44	@JeffProbst Ha! Mr. Dave Grohl. Very cool. And I'm impressed with your taste :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 16:32:08	@goofygal1171 @TysonApostol I was wondering how you were getting your running in Denise. Wasn't it 1 there? Below 50 is too cold for me.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 16:38:51	@alliepohevitz Yay to getting away from LA. Going anywhere fun?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 17:05:54	@goofygal1171 "Feels like -10" WTF does that feel like?!?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 17:10:30	@robstaboobuzzer @RHAPfan21 When was it last in NY? Seems like it's been a while.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 17:38:14	@goofygal1171 @TysonApostol OMG. 7 degrees! Can't fathom. Looking like a ninja is awesome. Freezing your butt off... Not so much.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 18:00:24	Getting ready to get ready to force my butt to the gym. #coldandlazy
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-08 23:31:26	@UTKevinAcee why? If he wasn't held could've been a TD.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-09 00:16:33	@AMANDAZUCKERMAN @mccraechum awesome. What's McCrae's new job?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-09 01:07:01	@robstaboobuzzer Puke for you. But I enjoyed the routing in the younger Manning.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 19:12:35	@DaltonRoss it's been good but it depends what criteria is. As far as toughness, it's watered down from other seasons.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 19:50:31	@KatieCollinsSur @CowledWriter Yay. And "lose" instead of "loose" please :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 19:58:46	@CowledWriter @KatieCollinsSur You used "you're" correctly :) I was pointing out a pet peeve of the misuse of words rampant on social media
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 20:00:24	@CowledWriter @KatieCollinsSur Lol!! I don't think Katie would call you out like that!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-09 02:12:00	@teetomterrific You're right btw. I'm hooked on TWD.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-10 21:42:42	Not too happy that providers are opting out of taking individual health plans come 2014. It's kind of an Ef U.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-09 04:00:50	@goofygal1171 I started watching The Walking Dead. Totally into it :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-11 16:55:15	@mrsredsox0923 how come you're not coming out for the finale?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-11 17:16:21	@truedorktimes 100% agree. How is that not a rule? Short memories and attn span.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-11 18:20:27	@robcesternino what type of design? Web or print?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-11 18:21:19	@FiligirlFu @JeffProbst I think he'll say Keep Trying and Be Yourself ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-11 18:27:10	@Hayden_Moss will the title of the episode be named after something you said again? Hmmm
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-11 17:15:33	@DaltonRoss And you didn't vote for Cochran! Nice job. #NoOffenseToHim
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 00:29:54	@L_Ho_2012 @CurtClark Hey it was "cold" for us a couple of days ago. Below 60 ;) #brrr
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 01:35:56	@ReneJHerrera going through withdrawals already
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-11 01:00:36	@robstaboobuzzer ok bubble boy
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-11 01:19:12	@mrsredsox0923 We're in LA so will be here. Would love to meet your hubs @robstaboobuzzer and @ReneJHerrera and maybe some survivors
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 04:22:48	Queen of RI is @LauraMorett. Killing it.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 05:08:13	@ReneJHerrera Love him on Survivor. He's grown up. Didn't think much about him on BB
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-11 01:41:11	@ReneJHerrera @mrsredsox0923 @robstaboobuzzer only if you buy me a drink ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-11 01:42:50	@ReneJHerrera @mrsredsox0923 @robstaboobuzzer Eeek. Maybe not that. *shudders*
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-11 01:50:02	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera @mrsredsox0923 Unless they're in AA. It's like the equivalent of water to them. #screwem
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 18:35:08	@ReneJHerrera I was so inspired by your #TBT pics, I added my own earlier. Where is the twitter love? Lol...
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 21:46:07	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera it's definitely fishy. There will always be a point where people stop paying in and that's when it falls apart
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-13 01:33:58	@ChadKincaid1 I live here but not sure how to do that ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-13 02:21:13	@ChadKincaid1 yep I'm here. It's ok. I prefer San Diego.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-11 17:12:58	@goofygal1171 Denise when are we going to the state of Paradise? ;) Hehe. #iWish #needavacation
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-11 23:05:10	@robstaboobuzzer omg. Don't they know to sched around Survivor?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-13 04:30:10	#Chargers beat both Manning bros within give days! Go Bolts!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-11 23:19:24	@robstaboobuzzer with an arrow or a gun?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 00:22:57	@mccraechum @DonaldGlover Do you watch Community? Love him in it.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 04:42:40	Holy Sh*t! Dead last @cieraeastin won immunity! She's full of surprises this season.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 05:11:29	@stephenfishbach I loved the banter at tribal... Hearing both sides. And Ciera won. No way that was predictable.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 05:25:21	@SurvivorPenner Are you going to the actual finale? You must be special to get an in :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 06:09:10	@Hayden_Moss will you be going to Reality Rally this year?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 06:11:14	@jerrimanthey nice look :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 16:56:08	@ReneJHerrera Lol!!! The shirt is the best. I think it falls under child abuse, haha
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 16:57:12	@robstaboobuzzer I thought of you when I saw this. "I dunno"
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 17:41:48	#TBT Go Chargers! http://t.co/SrWDAjrHUf
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 18:17:08	@ReneJHerrera @salomey5 It's exactly what it is. Not necessarily illegal, but unsustainable. Good to know what you're getting into
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 19:51:30	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera Ponzi schemes are illegal. Pyramid schemes aren't. But the one on top makes the most and the bottom lose out.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 19:51:50	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera picture a triangle where he's the top point
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-13 16:34:34	@UTKevinAcee @NateKreckman @TomNalen Why'd you think they would win? I'm happy they did but surprised you picked them.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-13 16:43:00	Keenan Allen should be Rookie of the Year. Love him. Go Bolts!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 04:07:47	"She's not great at Survivor, but she's really come in handy." Lol. Ouch. #BloodvsWater
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 04:21:40	Wow. @TinaWesson @KatieCollinsSur By far the most emotional moment of BvW regarding those family ties. You're both classy &amp; we see the love.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 04:29:19	@Hayden_Moss Ha! I called it. Another title named after one of your sound bites! Guess they love you :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-13 01:31:20	@ChadKincaid1 would u hang out in the hotel?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 18:39:42	@ReneJHerrera Lol! It does, doesn't it? Stopped that nonsense by my preteens!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 19:12:54	BREAKING NEWS: #Survivor renewed for 2 more seasons. @JeffProbst Yay!! Time for me to get cast!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 19:22:05	@JeffProbst Luv that #Survivor is renewed. Luv that u recognize emotion is good for show. All comes down to good casting, not so much twists
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 21:56:08	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera No. The pitch can sound very promising and enticing. It's done by testimonials. And the first people do get reward
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 22:08:29	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera Oh I see. Good question. Not sure. Sketchy?? Maybe.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 22:14:19	@salomey5 I know what you mean. To be fair, not everyone knows it eventually doesn't work. In his case, who knows...
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 22:20:54	@salomey5 Yeah. Hard to know what's what. Gotta take it with a grain of salt.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-12 22:23:17	@goofygal1171 I see you have redecorated here. Fun :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-13 03:32:07	@robstaboobuzzer @mrsredsox0923 @ReneJHerrera lol. It's all good ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-13 21:15:37	@robstaboobuzzer you hanging out in lobby? #jealous ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-13 21:40:49	@BBGossip I would take that as a compliment.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-13 22:01:15	@mccraechum or you could just stop watching.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-13 03:29:57	@mrsredsox0923 @ReneJHerrera uh oh
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-13 03:33:30	@robstaboobuzzer get some sleep. You'll need it. #NoPrisoners
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 01:42:21	I bet it's bad traffic for @ReneJHerrera and @robstaboobuzzer #FridayinLA
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 17:04:47	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Good Morning!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 17:23:52	@robstaboobuzzer You have fun on your 1st night? Is @ReneJHerrera passed out? Lol. Gotta keep up.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 17:27:45	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer Well he is so dreamy.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 17:28:58	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera I'm sure that's what they all say. Always blame the victim. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 17:30:09	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Ha. Can't speak for. Maybe she can speak got both of them. Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 17:33:13	@robstaboobuzzer ewwww lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 17:35:27	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Is it worth coming to hotel tomorrow? Boyfriend and I are busy during day today.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 17:48:11	@ReneJHerrera @robcesternino @robstaboobuzzer I thought you'd be the one to snore since you were the drunkard. Maybe you had a snore off
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 02:08:43	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer it's already starting
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 19:20:05	@Hawk_941 @robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera yep. Pretty lead what that dynamic is like.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 19:21:29	@Hawk_941 @robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera or at least from what we see on tv. Cause tv never lies, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 20:21:36	@KatieCollinsSur I see you're out here in LA. Is your mom @TinaWesson here yet? Thinking of you two. Have a great weekend.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 20:24:48	Should I or shouldn't I?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 21:44:32	@KatieCollinsSur @TinaWesson Will you both be at Reality Rally this April? I will be volunteering. It'd be fun to meet you :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 21:46:20	Awesome feeling when your clients are doing amazingly well and you wonder if they need to come anymore. @goofygal1171
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-14 22:20:24	@ReneJHerrera @KatieCollinsSur As long as you don't inhale. Btw, where's my drink? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 00:58:48	@ABTVSurvivor @RyanACarrillo @KatEdorsson @Hayden_Moss @OddUsMusic @vytasyoga is there a cover charge?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 01:10:26	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera You boys headed to the pre-party tonight in Santa Monica?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 01:18:12	@GirlPakProds FYI, I just texted you. Not sure what you see first :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 01:21:52	@mrsredsox0923 Eh. Boyfriend can't go. Weird going by myself. Seeing if a friend who's a fan is available...
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 01:27:39	@mrsredsox0923 I'm close. Feels awkward going to a bar alone. Lol. Maybe I'll get some courage :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 01:32:00	@mrsredsox0923 very true! The worst that could happen is it's awkward and I leave.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 01:32:44	@alliepohevitz is it dead or does it need some troubleshooting?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 02:44:10	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Cool. You going early, late ?? You know the rules in LA, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 04:07:06	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera @mrsredsox0923 Yay. The boyfriend is coming. #survivorfinale party
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 04:11:56	@mrsredsox0923 @robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera wish you could be out here.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 04:22:20	@mrsredsox0923 I'm planning on volunteering for that one. Should be fun. I've not done this stuff before... New experiences :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 06:54:17	Just met @Hayden_Moss and he's as charming in person as he is on tv. Nice talking to you Hayden :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 06:55:55	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Where u at? It's fun here...
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 07:00:06	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer why not? Lots of peeps.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 07:02:36	@robstaboobuzzer @mrsredsox0923 @robcesternino @TinaWesson Ah Tina. Love Tina. Will have to wait til Reality Rally to meet
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 07:06:15	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer it's kinda far but not that bad with no traffic
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 07:18:56	@mrsredsox0923 nah. Just conversations ;) and Yau Man gave me an autographed card. Got too many things on me. I'll get pics at reality rally
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 07:20:50	@ReneJHerrera Your boy @davidgirton2 just got here.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 07:25:17	@mrsredsox0923 yeah. It's mostly an LA crowd. For whatever that's worth. But fun talking to some of the survivors.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 07:56:46	@ReneJHerrera yeah think so. We're leaving now. May go to party tomorrow. What u doing?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 08:29:26	@AMANDAZUCKERMAN saw some of your cohorts from bb15 tonight at #Survivor party. Too bad it wasn't you and @mccraechum :(
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 17:07:58	@robstaboobuzzer how did that happen?!?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 17:12:18	@robstaboobuzzer Oh man. Not good :( Can you walk on it?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 17:16:03	@JeffProbst what did you think of them continually burning the immunity clue?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 17:17:40	@robstaboobuzzer it was cool. Missed seeing you guys. But the hotel looked fun too.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 17:18:57	@JeffProbst Does @cieraeastin regret not flipping one week earlier?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 19:14:50	@Hayden_Moss have a fun day. Good party last night.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 19:16:36	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer Yep. I warned ya. 1 day left.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 19:21:13	@ReneJHerrera yeah bummer. But you had a good time at the hotel right?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 19:24:06	@ReneJHerrera fun. What's your plans today?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 19:28:36	@ReneJHerrera Last night I would've said yes. Today I'm thinking prob not...
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 19:31:53	@ReneJHerrera Work tomorrow... I would have to go by myself... Sore throat, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 19:38:51	@ReneJHerrera I would like to meet you guys. Do they have football on at the bar? What time do you think would be good?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 19:47:24	@ReneJHerrera cool. I'll plan on coming up around 1:30. I'll dm you if need any more details.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-17 06:57:02	@theabimaria Hi, it was good meeting you last night and talking about how we thought we looked fat on the Jeff Probst Show, lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-17 06:58:49	@SurvivorPenner Very nice meeting you last night. And look how cute we look in this pic! :) http://t.co/pQe5tRboDh
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-17 07:03:47	@GirlPakProds @SurvivorPenner Lol. I was wondering the same thing!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-17 07:43:22	@JustinFWalter Hi fellow #survivor fan and applicant. Really enjoyed talking to you for a bit last night about our burning desires to play!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-15 21:54:35	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera I'm here. Just parked.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 01:06:03	@stephenfishbach now you know how I feel out here on the west. But I'm watching live right now :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 01:21:21	Woohoo @TinaWesson! So focused. You rocked it. #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 01:22:35	The always classy @Hayden_Moss on his way out. You're a great competitor and great sport.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 01:41:11	@SurvivorPenner yep. Exactly.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 02:27:45	Who didn't see this final 3 for weeks? Oh well, the others tried. #survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 02:55:29	How pissed is @SayGerv that his bro @TysonApostol didn't say he would vote for him. Ouch. #stabinheart
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 03:06:30	Congrats @TysonApostol on winning #Survivor! You earned it and played an amazing game!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 03:21:17	Respect for @cieraeastin for the big moves she made. Definitely surprised me along the way.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 03:35:18	@robcesternino lol. Love it. !!!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 03:44:16	Aras promotes twitter handle while talking about his relationship with his bro. Thanks Cochran for starting a trend.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 03:46:22	Ok that was a bit awkward with Kat. Top heavy? #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 05:32:47	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera I just got here. When you coming?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 06:05:29	@robstaboobuzzer get your butt down here! ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-18 22:40:23	Just followed my bro @Keenan13Allen Love him!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-17 18:36:49	@ReneJHerrera hey yo, will you send me the pic you took of me and @robstaboobuzzer at the hotel? Thanks!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-19 00:16:26	@robstaboobuzzer laugh or cry? Maybe a mixture of both, lol. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 18:17:03	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera have a good flight home
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 19:52:42	@ReneJHerrera @robcesternino Uh yes. It was weird.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-16 19:56:03	Very nice meeting @robcesternino last night. http://t.co/tXWeua7g7j
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-17 18:47:06	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Btw, had much fun with you boys. :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-19 04:55:22	@ReneJHerrera Hope you're recovered ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-17 01:28:48	@Hayden_Moss it was a pleasure to meet you this weekend.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-17 03:05:43	@KatieCollinsSur bummed I didn't get to meet you and your mom @TinaWesson at the after party last night. Will have to wait til #realityrally
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-17 04:16:22	@ReneJHerrera glad to see you survived last night. Strange way to end the weekend. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-18 03:22:56	@BostonRob very cute. It's hilarious to me you're surrounded my all females.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-22 23:08:12	@UTgehlken if chargers can't be focused now to take care of business, then no point talking about playoffs
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-18 08:27:10	@GirlPakProds Fine. Now you tell me. Lol. Oops.  hehe. Nope. Haha ... ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-20 20:45:32	@AMANDAZUCKERMAN well, you tried. Now you can let it go and move on.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-20 23:34:46	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Ha. No way!!! Love you guys ;) #busyworking
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-20 23:36:29	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera :) I'm still waiting for #REN to send us our group pics.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-20 23:44:16	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer See how happy you two look. I guess my job is done :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-20 23:46:52	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Lol. But fun ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-24 19:01:54	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Merry Xmas to you two!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-24 19:23:03	@ReneJHerrera Santa's coming to my house. Tree is ready :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-24 19:28:05	@ReneJHerrera btw, are you preparing my tamales? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-24 23:35:20	@robcesternino @JoeKirsch3 To play with you on Survivor. C'mon, let's team up Rob!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-25 02:59:06	@robcesternino very cute
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-25 17:53:51	@teetomterrific great classic.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-25 03:49:26	@robstaboobuzzer love the family pic!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-21 19:10:59	@BostonRob Pfft. Why is it always up to the women? Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-21 19:14:28	So tired and lazy. Why oh why do I have to be productive today? #wouldrathernap
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-21 19:15:38	Btw, am I the only person in the world that has no clue what Duck Dynasty is?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-25 19:07:33	@Keenan13Allen You too! And I got my brand new Allen jersey from Santa ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-23 19:02:05	@mikeskupin @mjbok @alexday31193 obviously with the spoilers that leak, it's not enforced
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-21 22:47:13	@TinaWesson @KatieCollinsSur Thinking of you two during this holiday season.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-23 23:31:15	@ReneJHerrera Yummy. Ever make mole?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-24 02:42:07	@BostonRob time to get to work.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-22 19:12:04	@robstaboobuzzer @mrsredsox0923 she's a smart woman.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-26 20:35:22	@mikeskupin @owthgjamie  Why do you think that is Mike?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-26 21:05:34	Dreamt I was tossing around the football with @Hayden_Moss. Wishful thinking? Up for interpretation, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-22 22:22:57	Weddle!!!! #Chargers
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-22 22:49:17	@UTKevinAcee Sad part is all of their turnovers today were just mental errors. None were forced.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-28 16:30:10	@robstaboobuzzer Will #rtb have a spinoff? Or come back as something else?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-28 16:37:03	@robstaboobuzzer if you do leave twitter what will you do with your time? Imagine the productivity ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-28 16:46:28	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera you two should just move in together and start filming. That should get you started ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-28 16:47:08	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera tho I'm not sure where the mrs will be. Side characters maybe.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-29 21:02:06	@MartyCaswell Omg. Love it. And at same time incredibly nervous. So used to Norv teams.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-29 21:31:37	@UTKevinAcee this is exactly why I was nervous. Ridic.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-29 22:06:59	@UTKevinAcee cause the defense is playing like crap. They need to get it together.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-29 22:42:12	@MartyCaswell the boos have been earned. This is worse than Norvous time.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-29 22:55:03	@ReneJHerrera OMG. I'm having the same f'ing experience.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-30 00:44:44	Wow! #Chargers give me a heart attack. But you're in the playoffs!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-26 16:17:28	@mrsredsox0923 oh yuck. They'd gotta hurt :(
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-30 03:02:45	@alliepohevitz Yep. I promise I won't do that! In fact, I'll lose twitter and Facebook ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-30 03:04:18	@mrsredsox0923 do you have rules between you? It'd be like my boy being a Raider fan. *shudder*
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-26 20:02:00	@ReneJHerrera lookin' sharp!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-30 06:21:52	Worst fb/tweet offender: posting a snarky comment on a sports team &amp; getting upset when others defend said sports team. #IfUCantHandleSTFUp
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-30 06:43:21	@Weddlesbeard That was damn bold. Soooo glad it worked.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-01 05:47:21	@meehand happy new year!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-01 06:27:14	@FindMyNervous will have to check it out :)
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-27 23:53:15	@Keenan13Allen read the article in the UT. Glad you didn't quit. We need you too much!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-30 18:29:14	@EdBouchette @UTgehlken We're not the reason Steelers didn't make it in. They're the reason. 8-8
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-01 19:58:43	@robstaboobuzzer @mrsredsox0923 saw it. It's fun.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-01 20:40:58	@FindMyNervous ugh. Netflix kills me sometimes.
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-31 02:32:09	@robstaboobuzzer what kind you get?
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-31 19:26:45	@Keenan13Allen @DjFluker76 @IvanSHarris my 2 favorite rookies!
36507049	kqueen123	2013-12-31 19:27:15	@salomey5 better than when I are dinner watching The Walking Dead. Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-02 22:12:49	@goofygal1171 I've definitely been able to have a lighter schedule :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-02 22:15:10	@MalcolmWHW stand. go to car. drive. buy ice cream.

36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-02 19:31:16	@goofygal1171 You working today Denise or are you settling in and re-acclimating for the rest of the week? #MyVoteWaitTilMon
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-03 05:17:55	@goofygal1171 @NinaAcosta3 Awesome. Was just thinking about your PT advice today as my hip is lots better. ToughM would kill me, not you :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-04 21:33:56	Saw client. Better mood. Amazing how getting out of our own head can shift our day. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-05 01:02:10	Wow. It's gotta hurt to be a #Chiefs fan right now.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-04 00:09:42	@MartyCaswell why oh why does it all happen to you? You're a good sport, but we need you to get some good karma!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-04 00:10:21	@robstaboobuzzer enjoy. It stays good for a while :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-04 00:24:17	@robcesternino @robstaboobuzzer and the bromance continues :) #sweetnothings
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-05 04:39:06	@mrsredsox0923 Uh oh, he picked chargers too. Hope he doesn't jinx them.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-06 03:38:53	@robcesternino Rooting for you!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-06 03:41:48	Love the addition of Jonathan Banks on #Community! And soooo glad @danharmon is back.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-06 04:54:47	@DaltonRoss lol. You orchestrated that one well.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-07 06:14:11	@goofygal1171 I've caught up on ALL episodes of The Walking Dead. Now I have to wait like the rest of you. #impatient ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-05 18:58:57	@robstaboobuzzer Defense sucks. Has all year. Still lots of game tho.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-05 19:00:04	@robstaboobuzzer unless you really are cursed which then I ask you to root for the Bengals right now.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-05 21:05:53	#Chargers!!! Defense you stepped up and kicked ass!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-05 21:09:18	@robstaboobuzzer thank you for switching the jinx ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-05 22:49:42	@mrsredsox0923 @robstaboobuzzer btw, the Ha! wasn't cause your team lost :( It was cause you were funny. Just wanted to clarify ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-07 16:55:10	@goofygal1171 Loved it! Not just a zombie show. Really a survival show with good characters. Thx for the recommend :) #hooked
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-07 16:56:57	@robcesternino was just thinking the other day... I don't really listen to many podcasts, but when I do, it's #RHAP. Congrats and well done!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-05 23:58:36	@ReneJHerrera Ha. Yes. And handily ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-04 19:19:31	@GirlPakProds @SharkysSocial @hlwolcott @furiousnothing you better change your fb relationship status. No one steals your man (or chain)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-06 00:04:43	@ReneJHerrera thanks! :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-04 19:32:06	Post holiday blues. Gonna go see client, come home and watch #NFLPlayoffs. All weekend. That's it.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-06 01:02:24	@ReneJHerrera Ha, I know. They beat them already in Denver this year. Will be hard to do again. Happy to still have a chance :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-06 01:06:40	#Chargers win and I'm still alive in my pickem pool. Awesome football weekend!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-07 19:39:06	@ReneJHerrera Ha! 1. Didn't know you were so sensitive ;) 2. Plenty of credit to around. 3. Poor baby Judith :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-07 23:25:27	@mikeskupin wow! is he not freezing?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-08 04:26:39	@goofygal1171 @PinkRibbonMP lol. Save the boobies. You crack me up.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-08 04:49:47	@MartyCaswell is it time for a change?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-08 04:52:19	@ReneJHerrera what you doing? #drunktweet hehe
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-08 05:00:51	@Hayden_Moss so sad that Hayden never followed me after I met him and I swooned. Lol. Hope you're enjoying the new year.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-08 20:08:11	@MartyCaswell I like him in general but he sooo comes off as a douche in these interviews.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-09 00:26:34	@GirlPakProds who's doing that?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-09 00:30:01	@GirlPakProds lunch next week or week after?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-10 03:44:26	@GirlPakProds @nicholaselmi We just watched. Plenty of people have worst dishes and don't go home. Who ever said TC is fair?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-10 06:50:57	@GirlPakProds Lol. I was actually thinking the same thing. The season is kind of weird. The challenges seem redundant. Tho it could be me
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-09 19:39:46	@robstaboobuzzer How's rewatch of #Survivor Philippines? Love that season.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-09 19:48:44	@robstaboobuzzer @LisaWhelchel lol. Definitely some boneheads. Love Lisa.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-10 16:28:25	@goofygal1171 @JeffProbst Awesome Denise!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-11 17:29:10	@robstaboobuzzer thank you ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 00:41:18	@SurvivorPenner not gonna happeb
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 21:51:18	@MartyCaswell weird choice. He looks out of place out there.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 21:58:33	@robstaboobuzzer yep. Gonna be a tough day. Still a lot of game, but don't love the start.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 22:09:48	@UTKevinAcee Mathews out?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 22:44:45	@robstaboobuzzer so who do you want to win next week? Peyton or Brady?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 22:49:43	@robstaboobuzzer line playing like crap. And no running game.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 22:50:13	Ok I love you #Chargers, but this is embarrassing.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 22:52:31	Pathetic
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 22:59:05	@ReneJHerrera they've reverted back to the beginning of the year. Ugh. And key injuries.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 23:23:15	@goofygal1171 @drdrew Yeah too bad. I'll take notes for you, lol. What conference are you going to?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 23:44:36	@UTKevinAcee playing loose before. Too tight today. And too conservative play calling.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 23:45:11	@MartyCaswell it was embarrassing before. Now there are no words
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-13 00:39:40	@robstaboobuzzer yes, but no. üòÅ
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-13 00:54:09	Today was tough but I'm proud of my #Chargers. The future looks bright. ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-13 00:56:13	@robstaboobuzzer NFL actually gets the games they want. Shocking.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-13 00:56:42	@MartyCaswell very nice. Seems classy.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-13 00:58:21	@robstaboobuzzer thanks. Honestly it was a miracle they got this far. And Denver is really good.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-13 01:14:14	@DjFluker76 @Keenan13Allen To my two favorite rookies: Tough loss, but the future looks bright. You both were beasts this year!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-13 01:18:44	@UTKevinAcee they deserve to hold their heads high. They've fought for weeks and were beat by a better team.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 00:27:46	Still alive in the pick 'em pool. Thanks Seattle!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 17:58:08	@goofygal1171 @drdrew That's funny timing. Signing up today for a conference that includes both of them in March for CEs.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 18:20:13	@KatieCollinsSur @MarcusCooks Oh how fun. Went there for my bday last Oct. Enjoy! It's a delicious experience.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 19:52:52	@UTgehlken is the first we've heard of clary being hurt? Sux. Better to have consistency.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 20:41:28	@ReneJHerrera guess she's not sober anymore. Love how she is taking it seriously. Ugh
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 20:44:26	@ReneJHerrera Ha. Hear ya. Making jokes about your DUI is lame. And sad.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-12 21:05:07	@goofygal1171 @drdrew Dunno if this is same one..Affect Regulation &amp; Healing of the Self (interpersonal neurobio conf at UCLA). Come out! ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-13 04:52:38	@nrschu01 @UTKevinAcee  Broncos were the better team today. More talent and played decisively. But there's hope for the future
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-13 05:44:05	@ReneJHerrera @stephenfishbach can we not just enjoy how adorable and amazing she is?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-13 02:27:09	@DaltonRoss yes please!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-13 02:35:12	My girl Julie Bowen looks gorgeous tonight!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-13 16:47:19	@rmathews24 Ryan thank you for your hard work and excellent play this year! You've come into your own and Im proud you're a Charger! #beast
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-13 19:51:56	@salomey5 it's even worse when they make light of it. Show some humility.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-13 19:54:44	@salomey5 Ha. I'm so transparent. Lol. Yep. People make mistakes, but it's not funny.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-13 19:56:49	@salomey5 yeah I hear ya. She has a history. This isn't new for her.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-14 16:47:35	@robstaboobuzzer hey. Sorry it's been rough. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-14 16:56:23	@robstaboobuzzer hey it's all good. Sometimes the best thing to do is ask for help...or encouragement :) I would like to get on that show!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-15 04:08:22	@MartyCaswell did you know there is a keyboard for iPhone 5? It's a new gadget and I thought of you. You can finally convert ;) lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-17 16:49:58	@robstaboobuzzer Happy Birthday!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-18 22:45:12	@teetomterrific I'm Princess Leia
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-19 21:00:30	@SurvivorPenner I need your boys to win. Give em mojo!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-16 20:44:56	@robstaboobuzzer details?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-16 20:55:59	@robstaboobuzzer that's a shame. it's so weird when one sibling is so diff than the other.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-16 20:57:48	@robstaboobuzzer a 'non' ?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-16 21:04:09	@robstaboobuzzer you should trademark #NON ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-21 02:46:12	@mikeskupin @MuneebKhan7 When you say asked to compete do you mean go through the casting process or did you decline all those times?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-21 05:29:01	@FindMyNervous You watch Girls, yes? What do you think so far of this season? Btw, that vid in the beginning was f'ing hilarious!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-21 06:06:22	@FindMyNervous I am loving Hannah and Adam's relationship! I think I like this season best so far. And I don't miss Charlie...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-21 06:10:07	@ReneJHerrera I would like the season or their relationship? And more importantly why do you know what I'm talking about? Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-21 06:12:35	@ReneJHerrera hahaha. Ouch. Low blow man. But seriously, I didn't know guys watched this show.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-21 06:13:24	@ReneJHerrera would it be more offensive if I said you reminded me of Charlie or Ray?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-21 06:18:10	@ReneJHerrera Of course :) I was wondering. Any street cred you had would've gone out the window if you "admitted" to watching, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-21 15:38:21	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera @Hawk_941 the Harry Potter tattoo seals it. Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-21 15:40:42	@mikeskupin @MuneebKhan7 Yeah I figured. If they put out a large feeler to returnees how do they decide if lots of interest?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-21 15:50:24	@FindMyNervous 100% best season.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-22 16:43:36	@ChadKincaid1 @KatieCollinsSur Where's that held? Katie I look forward to meeting you at #RealityRally
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-23 01:57:24	@robcesternino I agree that having an older cast may make for a better season. Of course this comes from me being 40 and wanting to play ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-20 23:57:38	@weddlesbeard have an awesome time. You deserve it! And Eric does too ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-23 03:01:20	@FindMyNervous I'll offer my services if you need to get rid of some ;) They look great!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-23 04:06:41	@GirlPakProds @robcesternino That's all I want is to be on #rhap actually. The Survivor adventure is secondary ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-23 04:06:55	@GirlPakProds which Matt B btw?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-23 04:08:01	@FindMyNervous I like the green. Or if you have a darker blue :) Thx!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-23 04:08:36	@GirlPakProds yeah. Funny. He needs a partner. You should do it with him. Hehe
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-21 01:08:03	@KatieCollinsSur yay! Will do
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-23 03:07:38	@FindMyNervous Really? That's sweet. I loved that green one you did. Blue, green, gray (whatever have) Maybe you should start selling ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-23 03:08:03	@FindMyNervous p.s. If the green one was too hard anything is fine :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-23 03:11:35	@ReneJHerrera @FindMyNervous see there's people all over that want one ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-23 04:11:09	@FindMyNervous You are awesome!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-23 04:13:33	@GirlPakProds Ha. Wasn't sure if she wanted to do it.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-23 05:17:34	@goofygal1171 @RonEappleseed Omg. I somehow knew you didn't have an iPhone before. Welcome to apple. You may like it here ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-23 18:57:05	@robstaboobuzzer yeah which then makes me wonder why they felt the need to label it bbb? A lot of them seem to be able to cross over
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-23 18:59:36	@robstaboobuzzer definitely. Better for yet game if they are well rounded.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-23 19:09:40	@robstaboobuzzer lol. I knew you would go there. Haha
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 00:10:39	@goofygal1171 Hey Denise! I just realized today is my 2 year anniversary of being licensed! I'm practically a veteran now, LOL
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 00:18:35	@GetOnSurvivor @kathytrantham How long have you been trying to get on the show? I suspect a long time given your twitter handle?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 00:33:46	@GetOnSurvivor @kathytrantham No love yet. I'm trying to get some love too. Though in earnest just the last couple of cycles.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 00:42:12	@GetOnSurvivor Thx! I'm a psychotherapist. A less stable Denise, lol. Not married, do have boyfriend. 41. Not their 1st choice.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 00:43:20	@GetOnSurvivor I've tried to show my competitive side, but really need to show my feisty side. I think I come across more "gentle" than I sm
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 00:43:31	@GetOnSurvivor what's yours?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 00:44:09	@FindMyNervous Thank you so much!!! You are amazing and so kind. I'll let you know when I receive :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 00:56:28	@GetOnSurvivor exactly right? I am perfect for Survivor!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 00:57:25	@ReneJHerrera @GetOnSurvivor Ha! Don't listen to #REN He makes you drive him places at wee hours of the morning! ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 01:02:12	@GetOnSurvivor I love Denise. I talk to her quite a bit. It's great players have vouched for you. Wonder why that hasn't helped yet?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 01:03:46	@ReneJHerrera @GetOnSurvivor Are you just jealous I'm talking to Andy on not you? You must miss me ;) p.s. That still was a STRANGE night!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 01:13:03	@ReneJHerrera @davidgirton2 OMG. This is what I'm missing? Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 01:16:50	@ReneJHerrera he has a good body. I'll give him that. Haha
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 01:18:36	@FindMyNervous @ReneJHerrera I would imagine. Tho I was pleasantly surprised he was less mortifying in person.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 01:20:57	@GetOnSurvivor Of course Allie sent angry tweets at the finale and is now working for them. But I guess she was already "in" the club.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 01:21:42	@ReneJHerrera @FindMyNervous And I was with them. That's when I realized I'm not 20 anymore. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 03:45:49	@goofygal1171 the best part about it is not having to count hours or worry about passing the grueling tests. #dontmissthat
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-24 19:28:11	@alliepohevitz so you're saying you want me to send you my video? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-24 19:28:49	@alliepohevitz p.s. What region do you watch? Or do they just make you watch all of them? Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 21:43:50	@JohnMCochran Ha. Funny. My boyfriend @furiousnothing got pranked by them too! They're everywhere.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 04:37:25	@alliepohevitz Ok. You working for it. You got it. http://t.co/ALAO7qHwQc
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 05:06:12	@alliepohevitz @Paulooch12 Is that unique to you or do the other casting peeps watch the full vids too?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 05:09:11	@DonaldGlover Will miss you on #Community Love, love your character.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 05:10:11	@alliepohevitz @Paulooch12 Ha. I agree. Rumors out there that you may only watch the first 10-30 secs. Good to know otherwise :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-27 05:57:03	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera in a good way?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 18:50:47	When there are open parking spots at the gym, it's not necessary to block someone in. #gymproblems #commonsense
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 19:58:03	@robcesternino @GirlPakProds Deb I'm not able to go to Barney's for #RHAP meet up, but you should! Say hi to Rob for me ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-25 20:26:02	@goofygal1171 You may be biased right now but would you prefer super cold or super hot weather? And you can't say neither ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-27 22:11:28	@FindMyNervous Look what I got today! So awesome! Thank you so much :) http://t.co/fjGravTSkM
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-27 22:32:44	@FindMyNervous I will! :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-27 06:12:36	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer that's too bad :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-28 02:37:31	@FindMyNervous @ReneJHerrera Yay! Now we're hat siblings!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-26 04:37:38	@alliepohevitz @GutULykaFish will you really watch the vids? My real one was submitted early Fall. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-29 02:35:40	@CherylStrayed Oh how awesome! I live near there and my mom died in my early 20s. May have to go.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-29 04:09:17	@kclark168 cryptic
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-27 18:25:35	@robstaboobuzzer @nofate1991 @ReneJHerrera I can't confirm or deny. #confidentiality ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-26 16:47:08	@bwheeler3737 Hey! No luck yet :( I'm pretty sure they are still looking for BvW. Go to the site. They tell you how to submit there now.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-28 16:34:35	@robstaboobuzzer it's a great question that I've asked some survivors themselves. The money, but no tv.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-01 22:00:03	@SurvivorPenner Wow. Why jail and not a hospital?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-01 22:00:50	@furiousnothing was he even invited?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-01 23:07:48	@furiousnothing Uh I never said that.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-30 06:47:03	@FindMyNervous Yeah. There are no words for that ending. Except maybe WTF.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-30 06:49:32	@FindMyNervous And now she's off raising Harrison. Really? Writers couldn't do better than that? Gah is right.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-02 00:40:19	@UTgehlken weird then the big discrepancy.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-02 01:16:15	@GirlPakProds but you look great!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-02 01:31:22	Writers Guild Awards live streaming at http://t.co/Vhqn3GwIdX. Red carpet, then the show. #wgaawards
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-02 03:43:22	@FindMyNervous drink more then. :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-01-30 18:00:21	People have taken pictures of themselves for ages. Why do we now need a term to describe that action? #banselfie
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-01 02:01:45	@KassMcQ @TheGameSurvivor @rickyschroder Ahhh Tiger Beat. Pics all over my walls ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-01 04:45:10	Will miss @iamrashidajones as Ann Perkins on Parks and Rec. Love the relationship between her and Leslie Knope.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-01 16:37:26	@SurvivorPenner so sorry for your loss.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-02 07:12:28	@goofygal1171 that's actually a great idea. Send out one of your thought provoking posts at late hours and see the $ flow in ;) #drunkdonate
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-02 18:21:37	@robstaboobuzzer omg. Does he actually need to?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-02 18:39:17	@FindMyNervous oh no. Ugh.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-02 18:56:10	Extremely talented actor Philip Seymour Hoffman. RIP.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-02 18:56:35	@applebbrother @mccraechum that's often the case :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-02 19:00:22	@realityblurred so, so talented. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-02 19:31:17	Still in the pickem pool. Go Denver. Bring me home the bacon. This doesn't count as gambling does it? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-02 20:23:59	@robstaboobuzzer Wow. Growing up. It looks like he cleaned his face ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-02 21:26:43	@drdrew @birdly92 @DrDrewHLN unfortunately we also suffer from the thinking that it won't happen to us.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-03 00:39:50	Wow. Choking.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-03 01:57:09	Glad I'm not a Denver fan. Embarrassing.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-03 00:15:19	What happened to Omaha?!? Get it together.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-03 03:42:33	Since the Broncs choked, the only chance I have at winning any money is #EsuranceSave30 What are better odds? This, lightning or lottery?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-03 03:54:39	@GutULykaFish Note to self: 1.5 mill &gt; getting struck by lightning ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-04 01:28:12	@KassMcQ I can't decide if that's creepy or awesome. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-04 01:35:15	@KassMcQ Haha. Maybe both then.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-03 17:30:04	@UTKevinAcee Roger Goodell is like Newman on Seinfeld.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-03 18:48:24	@UTKevinAcee may have made the game more interesting.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-04 16:35:43	@KassMcQ @lightsaber1972 What do you think was different this time you applied? Had you heard anything back the first times?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-04 16:37:44	@mikeskupin funny. I literally laughed out loud.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-04 16:57:30	@KassMcQ @lightsaber1972 Good to know. Thanks. A lot of people say "be entertaining" Mostly tho it seems they want to see who you are.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-04 17:19:21	@KassMcQ Cool. That sounds about right. Thanks!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-04 17:21:46	@KassMcQ And then get on the island and be a crap version of yourself due to starvation and paranoia. Lol. Jk. Have a great day.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-04 22:45:05	@ReneJHerrera when's the party?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-04 18:36:33	Got to the gym to find out they're closed due to filming. Annoyed. #firstworldproblems
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-03 22:35:59	@esurance love your using social media to change the game. Literally. #EsuranceSave30
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-05 05:32:57	@ReneJHerrera So no man crush on Malcolm? Was there ever love?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-05 05:35:37	@ReneJHerrera yeah I get the impression he's too cool for school. I now remember talking to you about this.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-04 22:49:45	@ReneJHerrera Awesome. Take pics. Want to see the before and after ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-04 22:52:20	@ReneJHerrera Ha! You should get him to come to your bachelors party. That I'm sure would be memorable.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-04 23:38:36	@KassMcQ @ReneJHerrera Nor do I. Kickin ass and taking names. Love it.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-04 01:02:03	@GirlPakProds @dribbleglass it can start young
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-05 16:53:32	@ThisIsSurvivor Hey so you followed me and then stopped following me in the same day. Are you just trying to get followers back? Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-05 17:00:54	@ThisIsSurvivor Exactly. That's what I thought! :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-05 20:51:17	@goofygal1171 who you talking to? Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-05 21:59:33	@goofygal1171 Funny. But usually you're fine with the process. Perhaps your brain is somewhere else. Happens to the best of us ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-05 22:54:33	@FindMyNervous is it any good?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-06 05:21:43	@thesounds @blondfire @ghostbeach CAN NOT WAIT!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-07 19:30:52	Got our tix to @thesounds show playing in LA! So excited!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-07 19:57:33	@goofygal1171 I guess the cold is getting to all of you, lol!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-07 19:58:16	@goofygal1171 Btw, I cannot wait til Sunday! The Walking areas returns and I get to watch it live with the rest of you :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-07 20:32:29	@goofygal1171 Pfft. Just saw my tweet about TWD was messed up. Hate autocorrection. At least you could decipher my message ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-07 20:59:26	@goofygal1171 Lol. That's actually awesome!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-08 02:25:49	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer who's Random?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-08 04:26:21	@ChadKincaid1 @alliepohevitz for individual or BvW?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-08 04:30:43	@ChadKincaid1 @alliepohevitz yeah it's tough when you don't have someone as diehard as you.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-10 16:05:41	@robstaboobuzzer good morning
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-10 16:15:01	@robstaboobuzzer Survivor will be like the sun coming out. It's been a long hibernation!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-08 16:35:55	@TinaWesson I will be there volunteering. Excited to meet you!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-08 16:37:41	@GetOnSurvivor you know survivor is nearing when the twitter bombs start. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-08 16:40:34	@meehand what are you making us Dawn? We'll be over soon ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-08 17:21:19	I'm ready. Let's go. http://t.co/L6jZkr60LR
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-08 19:16:29	Am I obsessed with myself if I take selfies and post them on social media? http://t.co/AJBy7ltmNm
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-08 19:23:36	@KassMcQ Hi Kass! How do you like twitter so far? It's certainly been entertaining on this end ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-09 17:07:04	@robcesternino @KassMcQ yep somehow I dont think you can control what happened just by writing about it. If so maybe Denver wouldve shown up
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-10 18:12:55	@ReneJHerrera @truedorktimes don't dm him, he doesn't write back. üòú Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-12 04:13:13	@salomey5 @eorlins definitely one of the best lines of all time.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-08 22:46:58	@GetOnSurvivor Hey read your post. I hear ya about not reciprocating the love.  I think it's gonna be hard for me to just watch the season.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-08 22:47:20	@GetOnSurvivor But of course I will.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-10 00:40:08	So I guess I received my first boot ever from a fb group. I wish I had done something exceptionally egregious to earn it. #whatawaste
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-10 01:05:32	@mrsredsox0923 Lol. I would savor it more if I had actually done anything to merit it. And really I mean, anything. Haha
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-10 01:05:49	@GirlPakProds I'll text you ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-10 01:06:51	@mrsredsox0923 yeah? I think I'm the last to join the club! I guess now I belong ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-10 01:59:25	@kclark168 Lol. Really nothing. I swear. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-10 02:01:59	@kclark168 I'm certain most people have :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-10 04:59:54	@FindMyNervous You know things are bad when Debbie starts acting out!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-10 06:24:21	@alliepohevitz Love your twitter tagline. Seems legit to me. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-12 19:17:14	@ReneJHerrera @truedorktimes @Kassting tough for people to follow instructions.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-12 22:01:31	@ChadKincaid1 have a great bday! Be safe.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-12 22:28:43	@KassMcQ @ThisIsSurvivor ah so the key was the wine. Good to remember ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-12 23:53:36	@goofygal1171 Hi Denise. You know what I don't like about our line of work? No-shows. #pfft
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-12 23:59:15	@goofygal1171 Lol. Nice way to reframe. And thanks about the profile pic :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-13 16:17:48	@robstaboobuzzer @mrsredsox0923 @HeIpfulTips Phew. Now I feel better about my cat scratch.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-13 18:12:14	@KassMcQ Would vote out my boyfriend in a heart beat! Sorry, it's Survivor ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-13 18:12:59	@KassMcQ Tho I suppose I would feel bad about it. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-13 19:57:28	@GirlPakProds Darn. That was my only call!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-13 19:59:21	@robstaboobuzzer Lol. What causes that?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-13 20:00:24	@KassMcQ I think twitter REALLY wants you to follow people. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-13 21:53:33	@salomey5 yeah if you post the you can turn off notifications for that post
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-13 22:48:28	@ReneJHerrera @salomey5 @aprilbathes to be fair FB can be a bitch sometimes.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-13 23:21:44	@TinaWesson Wow. Beautiful.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-13 00:27:40	@ReneJHerrera @goofygal1171 It's true. It's like talking to someone when they're trying to watch the game. My bad. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-14 02:56:32	Just watched the Survivor preview. Looks like it's going to be a great season. #casting
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-14 05:09:52	@GutULykaFish @BostonRob cause bread is yummy
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-15 17:32:50	@ChadKincaid1 Happy Birthday!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-15 17:59:24	@KassMcQ It appears your twitter ails have died down. So that's gotta count for something. #atleastfornow ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-15 18:04:17	I'm having an argument with myself. Butt says stay put on couch. Brain says go to gym. Mind says Uh. Can't I just go back to bed? #gettingup
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-18 20:36:43	@tony_vlachos @KassMcQ You know you don't have to respond to her if you really don't want to chat. #justsaying
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-18 23:16:44	@ReneJHerrera @ChadKincaid1 @robstaboobuzzer @KatieCollinsSur REN is up to no good. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-17 03:43:17	@teetomterrific Love her!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-17 03:52:03	@KassMcQ @tony_vlachos @ThisIsSurvivor And to think we don't even have to pay for this entertainment. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-19 15:59:44	I love the smell of coffee in the morning. It smells like victory.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-19 16:08:42	@meehand at least he's showering ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-17 16:32:41	@goofygal1171 @mwmasters and where were you that you had to battle chum? #creepy
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-17 18:12:48	@goofygal1171 @mwmasters Yum. Glad I was done with breakfast. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-17 18:13:34	@ThisIsSurvivor @Survivor_Tweet @JeffProbst You're not the only one looking for that call ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-17 18:22:38	@goofygal1171 @GetOnSurvivor @JeffProbst Or Fans of Denise vs. anyone else. We'd crush 'em. ;) #PutHimOn #PutMeOn
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-17 18:37:25	@GetOnSurvivor Curious if you go through periods of disillusionment and then periods of fight with trying to get cast? Today you see pumped.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-17 18:47:40	@GetOnSurvivor Fight is good. I've gone through ups/downs re not getting cast. But ultimately I fight. Shows how we'd be in the game :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-17 21:15:24	@ThisIsSurvivor how long have you been trying to get on the show?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-17 21:19:25	@ThisIsSurvivor yeah gotta keep trying!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-20 00:06:54	@parvatishallow love this!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-20 16:30:15	@robstaboobuzzer what tattoo you getting?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-20 16:33:17	@robstaboobuzzer ahh so romantic ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-20 16:34:03	@robstaboobuzzer what about @ReneJHerrera initials? You leave any room for him?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-20 16:37:16	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera LMFAO!!!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-20 18:39:41	@robstaboobuzzer @GetOnSurvivor @mrsredsox0923 ahem. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-20 21:46:03	@DaltonRoss hey curious if you ranked the survivors?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-22 00:23:10	@salomey5 better to check in on him and him be ok and mad then something else if you feel it's odd.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-22 03:00:26	Everyday is like Sunday. #morrissey
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-15 03:57:42	@goofygal1171 Happy V day Denise. No pun intended ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-24 04:13:46	@mattandtodd when do we get to hear your podcast with @goofygal1171 Sounds like it was entertaining.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-21 16:10:18	@SurvivorOz @goofygal1171 Yay I always enjoy listening to the wonderful Survivor Denise Stapley.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-25 05:23:42	@KassMcQ @colinstone Yep. I knew there was a reason you were on the brains tribe.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-25 05:25:58	@zach622 @KassMcQ @colinstone for any specific reason or did it seem the right thing to do?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-25 05:29:51	@zach622 @KassMcQ @colinstone there are plenty of reasons to avoid. Spoiling is definitely a big one.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-25 05:31:21	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera @kristanxmarie they actually do something? I thought it was just a title.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-25 05:34:47	@ReneJHerrera @salomey5 @kristanxmarie what are they "supposed" to do? Wear a crown?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-25 16:36:14	@survivor_bob happy birthday Bob. Have a lovely day!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-25 19:12:03	Am I the only one who feels a bit jealous when a new #Survivor season starts cause I didn't play? :0 #green
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-25 20:33:21	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera you know he likes to prey on the young
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-25 20:40:42	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer Lol you two. Russell.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-25 21:29:34	@truedorktimes @DaltonRoss I usually don't notice that stuff but actually missed it last season. It's as much of the show as music &amp; Probst.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 00:37:51	@ReneJHerrera Lol. Sorry. Tho actually I have Brice on my fantasy team.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 04:31:19	@KassMcQ You should see how young some of them are on that fb group we don't mention. Worries me at times.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 05:53:18	@JeffProbst woah new profile pic. Nice.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 05:54:58	@FindMyNervous shrinky dinkies, hole and the pixies? Good taste! Are you sure you aren't closer to my age though?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 05:56:18	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing Anyone got a craving for some pot salad ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 05:57:53	@FindMyNervous I'm fairly certain you are younger. But maybe you just look young ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 00:54:14	@ReneJHerrera Garrett could win it if he found a way to play with others.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 01:00:59	@ReneJHerrera you don't think he'll rub peeps the wrong way with wanting to do things his way? If he can temper that I agree with you.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 01:02:07	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera that idol is too much power in the right hands
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 01:03:10	@ReneJHerrera David def came more across that way. Something Garret said made me think that, but maybe it was small
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 01:57:41	@MSUGAL63 @GutULykaFish Ha. Love it. I really am surprised when I don't get a call. And pissed!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 16:13:48	Awesome start to #Survivor!! @JeffProbst Just think how RI would've weakened the impact of the OMG moments and boots. Food for thought. :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 06:00:13	@FindMyNervous See I have 9 years on ya. Though we would both be considered old on Survivor and BB. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 06:02:38	@FindMyNervous Of course. We would've passed our prime at 25 according to those standards. No old hags here. Haha.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 06:03:12	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing we have to eat light with our slab of ribs. Haha :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 16:32:39	@robstaboobuzzer @survivor_guru yep. Wonder how on earth you keep someone after that.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 17:23:43	Do fans and potential contestants a favor. If you don't want to do manual labor, deal with elements and starve. Don't go on #Survivor #thx
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 17:25:08	@KassMcQ Hey Kass glad you made it through the first votes! Hopefully something gives cause your Brains tribe is a mess :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-24 20:24:30	@KassMcQ Hey Kass. How are you feeling about Wed? Excited, nervous, nauseated? All of the above? Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-24 20:34:00	@KassMcQ Hilarious! Can't wait :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 20:53:40	@KassMcQ First glance. Mistake. Need to win challenges and you kept the weakest person. But you may have had your reasons they didn't show
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 20:55:56	@KassMcQ They were both liabilities at that point so lesser of two evils?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 20:58:50	@GetOnSurvivor @KassMcQ tribe may have won the previous challenge if J'Tia didn't blow it. Get rid of her and they could win
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 20:59:54	@KassMcQ Ah yes. That certainly illuminates your thinking.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 16:13:06	@truedorktimes oh yay. Finally someone over here. You and I will be the last 2 standing.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 22:32:45	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing Ha! But remember J'Tia is on your tribe!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 17:54:03	@goofygal1171 Sucks cause I never get to be part of the live tweeting #westcoastproblems :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 17:59:07	@ReneJHerrera @goofygal1171 Lol. Good point.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 18:24:35	@KassMcQ Alright Kass. Let's do this! I have to play vicariously through you until I get on #Survivor myself ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 18:53:10	@jerrimanthey @ThisIsSurvivor Jerry I'm bummed you won't be at Reality Rally this year! :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-02 02:21:16	@ThisIsSurvivor @CoDogSurvivor @ChadKincaid1 very cool!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-01 03:00:19	@FindMyNervous quick learner
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-01 03:05:03	@FindMyNervous Definitely annoying. And clueless. But yeah maybe best to give up, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-01 03:21:50	@FindMyNervous Hey now. Thunder is scary for us who don't have weather. I actually had to go out in the rain! Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-28 00:58:12	@robstaboobuzzer from?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-28 00:58:42	@MalcolmWHW maybe the 45 you will still have the same haircut.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-28 02:31:19	@JeffProbst LOVE that's it's all newbies.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-26 23:31:32	@JohnMCochran is it weird that you were in my dream last night? Seriously. And then my car was stolen. #survivordreams
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 00:33:07	@alliepohevitz @Survivor_Tweet will you be watching west coast time or streaming?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 00:49:14	@alliepohevitz @Survivor_Tweet I hear ya. I hate waiting, but I really like watching in HD. And usually I'm not able to watch early :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-01 05:23:08	@KatieCollinsSur Wow. Beautiful profile pic!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-01 05:26:10	@FindMyNervous these pics are so ridiculously funny to me. Seriously laughing out loud.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-01 05:29:38	@FindMyNervous and his name is Boo Radley? The cutest.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-01 05:31:49	@FindMyNervous From Atticus Finch to Dean? Identity Crisis ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-01 05:34:30	@FindMyNervous yeah definitely good home trumps his name.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-02 16:58:48	@ThisIsSurvivor @robstaboobuzzer I would agree. Or he's just insane ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-01 17:15:08	@truedorktimes @FiligirlFu it seems J'Tia wouldn't have been able to find her way out of a paper bag in that moment. #panic
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-01 17:19:50	@Fornaxus ahem
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-01 17:26:21	@GutULykaFish @Fornaxus numbers will take A LOT out of you.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 03:30:42	30 minutes and I get to catch up to the rest of the world that has already watched #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 04:14:06	@GirlPakProds He's a smart guy. And good to look at ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-02 00:32:14	@ThisIsSurvivor check it. http://t.co/iAAP7tlFPV
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-02 01:12:59	@teetomterrific @ThisIsSurvivor I think so too! See you at the final tribal!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-02 02:12:41	@ThisIsSurvivor Thanks! It would be more awesome if I got on the show. Also have a signed buff from him, but I like this better ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-02 02:14:38	@JeffProbst Awesome. And editing did a great job of giving us glimpses into each tribe.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-02 02:16:32	@JeffProbst Already loving it. Enjoying the fresh faces and well rounded casting!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 04:26:43	@GirlPakProds yep he was gonna be my first pick.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 04:38:17	The way to start your game on #Survivor ... Do not model yourself after J'Tia.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 04:40:29	Lol. "That's not very smart for the brain tribe" @KassMcQ
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 05:14:43	Garrett: "I don't want to play Survivor to survive." Uh, what do you think you signed up for?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 05:25:19	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing that's your guy ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 05:52:09	What J'Tia trying to be like Brandon? C'mon. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 06:03:30	Wow. J'Tia loses the challenge single handedly. Pours out the rice. And Garrett leaves with an idol in pocket. That's gotta hurt #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 06:04:08	@furiousnothing @GirlPakProds but she has all her players still. Doing something right.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 06:05:38	@ReneJHerrera when  I play don't expect a thong bikini
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 06:09:42	@FiligirlFu maybe they cancel each other out once they're together. Crazy.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 06:14:04	@goofygal1171 don't know how I wouldn't kick her ass out for doing that to my food. #girlgottaeat
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 06:17:58	@furiousnothing @GirlPakProds at least not together
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 06:20:31	@ReneJHerrera Loved it off the bat. It's gonna be a great season!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 06:23:06	@ReneJHerrera definitely not what I expected. At least we were actually surprised. And shows why RI is terrible. When you're out, you're out
36507049	kqueen123	2014-02-27 06:27:34	@ReneJHerrera I think they have a lot if good characters so I have high hopes.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-03 00:29:42	@mrsredsox0923 @JaredLeto Jordan Catalano is the best. Still have a crush!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-03 01:47:32	Very deserving win and beautiful speech @JaredLeto #Oscars
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-03 06:54:07	@GirlPakProds @piersmorgan @JaredLeto @McConaughey Dreamy and deserving. Good night at the Oscars.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-03 06:58:06	@FindMyNervous Was there no Shameless on tonight? :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-03 07:15:49	@TysonApostol @nofate1991 I think it's safe to say one would just be jealous of Jared Leto.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-03 07:19:13	Does it make me creepy that I still have a crush on Jordan Catalano?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-03 22:25:03	@ReneJHerrera @ChadKincaid1 Is that how you met your woman?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-03 22:27:06	@mikeskupin @SurvivorWiki seems like they're sticking to LA. Wonder if that'll change now that his show is off air.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-03 22:44:12	@ReneJHerrera @ChadKincaid1 That's awesome! Yep going out on dates gives you practice for when you find the right one ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-04 16:53:08	@GetOnSurvivor Read Dozen. Agree Tasha could be good, but think she let emotion get best of her. She could've kept quiet &amp; then strategized
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-04 06:34:05	@KassMcQ I feel like it's been quiet on the home front. No feuds. No snark. Guess I have to wait til Wed. Hope you had a great weekend!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-05 18:20:29	@ReneJHerrera awesome. Are you doing it for the whole season?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 00:14:21	@KassMcQ Hey Kass, do you watch an earlier feed or are you stuck waiting like the rest of us west coasters?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 00:20:06	@KassMcQ Yes, it would be terrible. Bad enough when you're not on the show to wait. Have to avoid social media like the plague! Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 00:23:16	@teetomterrific @KassMcQ Ha. I tweet later when everyone's already watched. But I'm not home by 5pm. Some of us have to work ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 03:30:58	@realityblurred Wow. Sending you and your mom good thoughts.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 04:37:56	Yay!!! Brains tribe finally wins in spite of weak start!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 04:45:24	@ReneJHerrera out of her league.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 04:59:17	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing Pfft. #TeamNitsirk is sucking ass. Thank you #3 out 3 spot. Ha.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 05:02:49	Uh oh. Previews for next week show Sarah contemplating throwing the challenge. Don't do it. Losing breeds losing. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 05:05:17	@furiousnothing @GirlPakProds Seriously. What's it called when they eat their own?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 05:17:21	@goofygal1171 @PlayItLoud25 Fun when it's combined with Sole Survivor. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-05 17:57:03	@ReneJHerrera @KassMcQ REN, you're doing a podcast? Uh oh. Run Kass, run. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 18:25:31	@KassMcQ That makes sense. Seems to fit your personality from what I've seen in the game and on Twitter :) #goodtrait
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-05 20:42:11	@KassMcQ @_SurvivorGirl @JTiaPhD You mean you have to "survive" on Survivor? Guess Garrett didn't get the memo.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 18:09:44	@KassMcQ Would you have dumped the rice if everyone told you, you were going home? Being human for 1 person is not equal for all I suspect.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-05 21:58:17	@robstaboobuzzer for you. Add 3 more hours for me. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 18:20:04	@KassMcQ yeah I'm not saying there's one way to win, lol. Clearly there are no set "rules" on how to play. 1/2
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 18:21:31	@KassMcQ Was just curious if your perspective is hindsight or was in the game. Would be hard for me to forgive at the time but I wasnt there
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 18:23:20	@KassMcQ basically anything I say comes from a narrow perspective and I know I don't have the full story ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 18:37:51	@KassMcQ @ampincivero A sociopath has no regret or guilt about their behavior. And they often are charming. Hmmm
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-07 22:33:54	@KassMcQ @Nick_Offerman @EW Awesome! I knew there was a reason I liked you :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-07 22:53:24	@KassMcQ @TheEllenShow @EW I can't see the pic :( And how did your wedding photo end up on Ellen's show?!?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-07 22:54:54	@KassMcQ Wow. Hilarious. You two are made for each other. Thankfully for your husband he's a fictional character ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-08 00:43:20	@chargers you used to follow me and now you don't ... maybe because I inadvertently blocked you :( #Chargers
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-08 01:37:45	@furiousnothing @chargers The question is who would I replace? Certainly not @DjFluker76 He's too awesome!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-08 02:37:21	@goofygal1171 Ha! Tough times at home Denise?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-08 02:45:23	@goofygal1171 And a long haul it may be since she's still young. I see teens, send her my way when older ;) Good thing you're adaptable :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-08 03:04:28	@goofygal1171 to be clear I'm in no way saying a kid going through puberty needs therapy. Was just teasing, tho the parents might want it :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-08 05:57:30	Posted an interview on http://t.co/PbKLC4RPcS today with @lenadunham and just watched this weeks Girls. Stellar writing. Season 3 rocks!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-08 06:16:36	@ReneJHerrera @SpencerBGM wouldn't that be considered robbing the cradle?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-07 05:27:30	@KassMcQ @chuffy86 @Survivor_Talk What kind of law do you practice Kass?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-07 06:23:33	@FindMyNervous Ha. You're friend is a pusher. The worst kind. Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 17:53:55	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing Omg! You're right! Especially this photo. Dreamy indeed :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 17:59:33	@KassMcQ @enm185 Ha! Tasha says lets practice. Kass says, uh no, decorating here. Guess Kass was right. Practice didnt help #survivornesting
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 18:27:41	@KassMcQ Will do!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-06 20:58:41	@ashes2ashes13 so you're watching BB Canada? Don't get burnt out for BB US. We need you then!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-07 16:17:38	@GutULykaFish explain please.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-07 16:17:57	@KassMcQ @chuffy86 @Survivor_Talk Do you enjoy it?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-07 19:14:19	@GutULykaFish ignorance is bliss
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-07 19:18:01	@GutULykaFish if that's their form of bliss, sure. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-08 22:54:47	@goofygal1171 Sending you warm weather :) Hope you're having a great weekend! http://t.co/0gfXJquykY
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-07 04:40:29	Omg somehow I inadvertently blocked my favorite team @chargers on twitter. User error or can I blame the app? #Chargers
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-07 04:47:20	@GutULykaFish what's pebsac?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-07 05:30:57	@GutULykaFish I suspect it was PEBSAC, but don't tell anyone :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-07 06:21:57	@FindMyNervous that's why I don't have them in the house. Not enough discipline.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-09 22:11:03	@goofygal1171 is it worth watching?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-09 22:19:10	@goofygal1171 btw I'm going to that Affect Regulation and Healing of the Self conf with @drdrew etal Fri. Too bad you can't come. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-07 22:07:03	@KassMcQ Sharing the spotlight with Ron Swanson (Parks and Rec) doesn't get better than that. You have arrived! :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-10 03:31:27	@lenadunham love your choices of music for the show!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-12 19:06:28	@UTKevinAcee how are they able to make it work?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-12 20:50:43	@robstaboobuzzer yeah I wondered how much you can watch while live tweeting.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-14 03:16:49	If anyone's using the new '14 health insurance plans be very aware of misinformation and arguably illegal actions on part of the insurances.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-14 04:00:22	@goofygal1171 Ha, I will! And I'll try not to drool :) Wish you were here for it too.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 03:10:55	Omg a Cliff sighting. I actually forgot he was in the game #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 03:17:55	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing panic city. Geez
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 03:18:51	@ReneJHerrera lol. You have a crush on Kass. Cute ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 03:26:20	@ReneJHerrera what? When did she say that? Not that you're not crushable :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 03:34:45	Throwing challenges isn't just about having the numbers or not. Losing breeds losing. And it also gives confidence to others. #badidea
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 03:57:17	Thank you Brains for using some brains. Had me nervous. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 03:59:52	@goofygal1171 @Survivor_Tweet Lol. I caught that too. Way to minimize what you did.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 04:03:03	Crap for brains tribe. Haha. Love your sound bights @KassMcQ
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-11 02:22:22	@truedorktimes @gordonholmes Since I don't have a fever with my sore throat I give it 2 MeowMeowBeenz
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 04:07:42	@KassMcQ damn. Love my autocorrect too. Sound bites, not bights
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 04:11:15	@furiousnothing @GirlPakProds I just realized this is the first week nitsirk didn't lose a player! Woohoo!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-11 19:53:51	@KassMcQ @MomOfKai Are you going to go see The Lego Movie?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-11 15:56:23	Ok I'm ready to say goodbye to you sore throat. 5 days is enough. I have things to do. Shoo.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-11 16:00:24	@goofygal1171 I just like saying butt a bunch. Does that make me weird? #pottyhumor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-11 17:30:45	Trying to run while sick with a sore throat may not have been my most clever idea. Not as lame as my eating salsa last night, but close.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 15:44:23	"I usually rise to the top in high pressure situations" really means wildly flailing your arms and panicking to the pt of meltdown #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 17:39:00	@kclark168 you know DM are meant to be unseen.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 19:09:06	@ReneJHerrera @salomey5 @ChannonSarah once she's untrustworthy by dumping rice, she's untrustworthy. Can't think anything different
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 19:10:30	@KassMcQ @Mike_El I guess you're the aggressor in the relationship Kass?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 19:21:36	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera @ChannonSarah maybe. But having 3 isnt enough. They need to join w others &amp; others may not've wanted to work w her.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-11 20:09:27	@KassMcQ @MomOfKai Ah too bad. That would be awesome!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 21:33:49	@SpencerBGM So you seem completely diff on the show than your preinterviews. Who is the real you?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-12 18:05:16	Age of Consent - New Order #oldschool #getyourdanceon
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-12 18:15:04	@mikeskupin @CJRobustiano @troy_zan losing breeds losing. Bad idea.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-12 18:17:54	@KassMcQ @monksmediamod Poor Chet. But honestly one of the funniest Survivor scenes ever. Still makes me and the boyfriend laugh.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-12 18:19:24	@sarahlacina @mikeskupin @CJRobustiano @troy_zan I imagine much is diff when out there. But I would also think rule of thumb still stands.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-12 18:21:59	@sarahlacina @mikeskupin @CJRobustiano @troy_zan of course there's never 100% "right" way or "wrong" way. Let's see that happens :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-12 18:25:21	@CJRobustiano @sarahlacina @mikeskupin @troy_zan yeah my first instinct is Cliffy via Tony's lies.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-12 18:27:08	@CJRobustiano @sarahlacina @mikeskupin @troy_zan but right now we don't even know if they try to throw it or it's a CBS sound bite.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-14 02:13:02	@UTgehlken shocked anyone signed him.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 03:40:33	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing pathetic. No words.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 03:45:54	C'mon Brains tribe. Do the right thing. It's time...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 03:46:10	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing don't we all?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-13 04:04:10	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing well do you feel better now?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-17 02:42:11	Wow. What an intense, gut-wrenching episode of #TheWalkingDead
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-17 03:48:16	@teetomterrific talk to you in 15 ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-15 23:53:51	@drdrew You were awesome at the conference yesterday. And I loved how honest you were about being anxious. Thx for talking to me :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-17 15:56:24	@SurvivorPenner yep. Sat straight up! Not my favorite.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-16 20:06:57	@teetomterrific yep. And lately they are from people creating new survivor accounts trying to pass themselves off as experts.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-17 02:49:03	@teetomterrific definite priority. Must watch.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-16 01:49:16	@robstaboobuzzer for a moment. And then it creates more problems.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-17 04:02:29	@teetomterrific yes 100% agree it had to be done. Amazing episode.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-18 19:49:36	@KassMcQ @nofate1991 I relate. Got masters in psych while working full time, passed tests. Now licensed :) But I still owe. #blur
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-16 20:00:56	I love how people follow you on twitter only to unfollow you a day or two later cause they wanted you to follow them back. #seeya
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-17 22:47:32	@KassMcQ @SpencerBGM Had to be done. The other choice was too unpredictable and untrustworthy. #FromTheCouch
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-17 02:45:43	@DaltonRoss Carol did the only thing to be done. But it was certainly gut wrenching.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-18 02:58:53	@KassMcQ you've been relatively quiet. Calm before the storm? Or just calm?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-18 03:02:52	@KassMcQ Cool. Seems like a good balance :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 03:18:58	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing survivor problems
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 03:26:35	Lol. Every single Beauty pitching to the Brains tribe. Love how the game can turn #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 03:27:35	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing they prob won't know what it is unless Tony put a sign up. Haha
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 03:38:52	Yay former Brains tribe! Good you kept @SpencerBGM! #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 03:39:32	@ReneJHerrera @KassMcQ lol. First time I noticed them too!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 03:46:18	My tribe #Nitsirk sucks. On par with Brains tribe and Matsing. @GirlPakProds @furiousnothing
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 03:50:58	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing I told you Id rather have him than boobs. You didn't bite. Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 03:52:25	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing haha. But created spy shack. And is actually smarter than he seems.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 03:57:38	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing wow. 1. I can't believe he didn't play the idol. 2. I can't believe it worked.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 04:00:26	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing looks like one of mine wants to quit next week. Of course. Im just gonna stick with rooting for LJ
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 04:01:03	@ReneJHerrera @colinstone was shocked that he didn't and that he stayed. Wow.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 04:02:11	The looks on Woo's and Lindsay's faces after the vote... Priceless. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 04:03:24	@ReneJHerrera annoying for sure
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 04:05:30	@aswuttoscano definitely. Especially when we don't even know how it's going to go down.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 04:09:31	@furiousnothing @GirlPakProds it's quality not quantity. In trouble.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 04:13:33	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing I third that
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 15:28:32	@GetOnSurvivor @DaltonRoss my guess = LA
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 15:30:07	@KassMcQ @JeremiahPWood he is cute though so who could blame you?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 15:32:31	@KassMcQ @JeremiahPWood just someone younger than us Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 15:51:18	@KassMcQ @JeremiahPWood I hear ya :) Tho not married, bf and I celebrating 13 yrs on Mon. Off the market too.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 15:59:03	@KassMcQ Ha. Even in CA where our seasons aren't as noticeable... Something to that Springtime :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-20 19:13:45	@DaltonRoss Survivor better? Or the death of Idol?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-21 04:31:12	@GirlPakProds @UncleCliffy30 @furiousnothing Yes fun to watch. But prob not fun for him ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-21 14:59:36	@UncleCliffy30 @GirlPakProds @furiousnothing That's what most of them say. But I can see you were just getting started!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-21 16:45:07	@meehand good enough is perfect :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-21 03:35:11	@goofygal1171 Were you gonna share with us that you're on #RHAP? Getting modest now? ;) Looking forward to listening...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-22 18:57:16	@GirlPakProds You were in my dream last night. Made me think we should do lunch soon.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-22 18:57:54	@robcesternino good stuff Rob. Will you be at Reality Rally?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-23 04:04:06	Getting pumped to rock out to @thesounds tonight! If it's too loud, you're too old. @furiousnothing
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-23 05:05:33	@ReneJHerrera btw you know that part with David was weird, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-23 06:39:59	Is drunk tweeting the same as drunk dialing? I'm gonna say no, right?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-23 01:26:59	@GirlPakProds Ha. Funny. Crazy vibes out there.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-23 04:14:16	@ReneJHerrera hey man. Come out for the finale!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-23 04:38:40	@ReneJHerrera Haha. Yeah it's tough during the week but it'd be awesome to see you guys again.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-23 04:39:42	@ReneJHerrera plus we made memories ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-23 04:45:59	@ReneJHerrera that would be awesome to meet her. And I could prob drag my bd Dexter out
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-23 04:16:25	@goofygal1171 Hi boyfriend and I were talking about Reality Rally while celebrating our anniversary tonight. Can't wait for him to meet you!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-23 05:39:47	@ChadKincaid1 @alliepohevitz too bad neither of you will be at Reality Rally :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-23 06:42:05	Rocking out to @thesounds reminds me of what it was like when I was young. F' yeah! #LosAngeles #TheSounds
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-26 17:52:05	@goofygal1171 Lol. Junk food = better than sinking into an emotional abyss wondering what's the point. Haha. #NahItsNotThatBad
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-26 23:26:29	@ReneJHerrera where do you see that? Fb?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 03:07:49	@furiousnothing @GirlPakProds disagree. Fine for Trish. Cowards way out.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 03:43:09	@goofygal1171 @sarahlacina exactly. Enough info to "make a new alliance" Once again Tony's too loud.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-25 22:29:40	@KassMcQ @paxel_axel hate the game. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 04:13:15	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera I can see it more on a show like big brother. But definitely didn't see it here.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 15:27:26	@SurvivorOz if they are following you they're no doubt following other Survivors who live tweet with the show. To single you out is silly
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 21:07:30	@goofygal1171 I don't know anyone who has had torn labrum so I'm a bit in the dark. Hopefully the PT peeps will know what they're doing.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-29 15:10:18	@goofygal1171 @bmstapley Awesome! Looking forward to seeing you both though it won't be til Sat. for us.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-26 23:22:19	@ReneJHerrera lame
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-28 21:18:31	@KassMcQ I've noticed that about you. It's easy to judge on the outside but you have 1st hand knowledge what it's like.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 02:55:13	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing I have a suspicion #nitsirk will lose another member tonight. Ugh.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 03:13:35	True example of "taking my toys and going home" when things didn't go her way. That sux. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 03:26:24	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing I wrote it. Haha
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 03:27:43	Loose lips sink ships Tony. #survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 03:40:41	@teetomterrific if only  it worked that way. No more recruits.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 04:07:13	@truedorktimes yeah unfortunately I avoid all social media until it airs out here.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 04:08:13	@FindMyNervous @ReneJHerrera I ate my feelings. And that just created more feelings about eating my feelings.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 04:09:25	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera honestly I didn't see any bullying. One can dish it but not take it. Whatever.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 04:10:08	@FindMyNervous @ReneJHerrera Lol. It's like the high before the crash. Enjoy ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 04:14:49	@truedorktimes ugh. That's definitely annoying.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 04:17:09	@KassMcQ no matter what happens the rest of the season we can easily say you win the title for best sound bites. Dry, witty and sarcastic ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 04:22:10	@goofygal1171 @KyleRoth13 I assume she was a recruit. Could be wrong. They're often not as invested as those who truly try to get on. #sux
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-26 15:13:34	@goofygal1171 who's hormones are off kilter today?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-29 04:37:06	@GirlPakProds I'm gonna put it out there and say I've has enough of the earthquakes for a while.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-29 05:03:36	Mother Nature may not have given us a freezing winter, but she's giving us earthquakes. Ok. That's enough now. Please and thank you.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-29 20:49:13	@DiahannK Hey looks like I'm your first follower ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 17:37:06	@goofygal1171 Hey, have you ever dealt with a torn labrum (or cartilage)? Hip or shoulder?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 18:58:21	@goofygal1171 PT first. If that doesn't work they would suggest arthroscopic surgery. But, I DO NOT want surgery. So I'll focus on PT ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 04:22:53	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera yeah cause this wasn't bullying. This was someone who didn't get their way.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 05:30:24	@KassMcQ Is it nice for a change to be outside the drama? I would think it means your game is holding up for the moment...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-30 03:16:55	@EddieRoyalWR So glad you're still a Charger!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-27 22:01:09	@goofygal1171 thanks :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-28 21:25:04	@KassMcQ Definitely! But I would guess not everyone has as mature of an attitude about it as you do. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-28 23:44:42	@goofygal1171 @bmstapley yay!!! Lol. Will I get to meet you Brad at Reality Rally or will you be home with Syd? (I can't remember)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-28 21:12:24	@KassMcQ Are the cast mates you follow on twitter the ones you keep in touch with? I understand if you can't answer that ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-28 21:16:43	@KassMcQ Makes sense. :) Lol about the teamtv.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-28 21:18:59	@KassMcQ Haha. Yes. So fitting!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-28 23:42:50	@KassMcQ just saw he has a website now. Right up your alley. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-03-31 22:39:41	@FindMyNervous I only had one fish. Her (or his) name was Goldie. You can imagine what type if fish it was. Sorry about yours.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-01 03:51:13	@ReneJHerrera it was actually a really funny show for a while.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-01 04:02:42	@ReneJHerrera I was so loyal to the show I sat through this last season. Rough. Just like shows like #Dexter
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-01 05:53:15	@robcesternino @sepinwall @HitFix Sucky ending doesn't take away from the whole show since it really was about the whole gang
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 03:00:00	Longest wait ever. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 03:06:54	@robcesternino possibly, but surprised Sarah was offended by that. No one should trust anyone 100% out there.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 03:24:24	@goofygal1171 sounds like a tough week. Hope the beer was good :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 03:25:55	Bad idea to get too cocky. Look out. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 03:47:12	Chaos Kass! Love it. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 03:55:50	Aha. This is the night where Kass becomes the "villain." #ChaosKass #bigmoves #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 04:02:18	@ReneJHerrera she brought it on herself by missing the pulse of the tribe, being to cocky and bullish. But she went out with class
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 04:04:43	@ReneJHerrera I'll have to check. I don't follow her. But I don't think Kass would've flipped if she hadn't been do bull headed
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 04:08:02	@ReneJHerrera wow. Guess you're right. Lame. She got cocky. Own up to it. Someone else made a play. Grrr
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 04:41:47	@KassMcQ Good you wear a coat of armor cause I see you're getting a lot of crap for playing the game.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 04:55:29	@KassMcQ Exactly. Totally f'ed up. Survivor is just a microcosm of our society at large. Contrived, but those "rules" still ring true.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 05:01:21	@Liam_Padraic @KassMcQ really? You think it's ok to say that to someone? Would you say that to her face?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 05:11:00	@KassMcQ One can question whether you made a good move, but calling you names or deriding you is bs and to your point.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 05:13:35	@sarahlacina you went out with class tonight but on twitter you seem pissed. Has this brought up bitter feelings?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-04 04:23:13	@goofygal1171 Ok tomorrow is finally Friday. Hope you're looking at a good upcoming weekend. My brain needs rest too! #NoMoreFriedBrains
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-04 14:56:03	@goofygal1171 yes a glass of wine may be in my future. After client, other work and PT :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 15:14:34	@TBMWolverine @KassMcQ Some may have but others like Dawn got ripped to pieces for a move the audience didn't like.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 15:16:53	@mstarjd @KassMcQ time will tell about the move. But does she deserve the vitriol she's getting?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 15:30:31	@mstarjd @KassMcQ Haha. True. They got ripped. It's like they killed everyone's kittens.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-04 16:30:39	@KassMcQ @meehand @qpoddess @missfoxytasha wasn't she best buds with you just recently during rice gate?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-04 17:53:10	@FindMyNervous better than mine. Lol. I get other neighbors mail and vice versa. Had to go complain to local post office.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-02 16:48:00	@KassMcQ @SpencerBGM of all time or of the season, lol?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 15:59:02	@KassMcQ @mstarjd  Yeah I obviously don't know the outcome, but it seemed clear to me you felt like you were at the bottom of that tribe.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 16:29:24	@KassMcQ @gordonholmes I guess you two don't get along eh? Creating havoc around camp? #ChaosKass
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-04 17:54:17	@KassMcQ @meehand That's #ChaosKass for ya :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-04 17:55:45	@FindMyNervous Ugh. Drives me f'ing crazy when they are so incompetent.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 17:03:14	@KassMcQ which preview?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-02 21:37:32	@KassMcQ @ReneJHerrera He really does love the #jorts And glasses.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-04 22:44:19	@mikeskupin @BowyerX @CBSSurvivorTalk Too cocky. Almost always the death in Survivor.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-03 18:43:13	@brigbenny24 @KassMcQ coming from an egg.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-05 02:49:08	@meehand @salomey5 I love you Dawn. You're the best.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-05 02:49:43	@GirlPakProds OMG. I read that sooooo long ago.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-05 02:52:46	@KassMcQ hey checking in and seeing how you're holding up.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-05 02:57:01	@goofygal1171 had some wine. All my troubles have slipped away. Haha.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-05 02:58:35	@salomey5 @CBCNews what did they do?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-05 02:59:25	@robstaboobuzzer haven't talked to you in a while. Hope things are good.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-05 03:05:21	@salomey5 @CBCNews ah cool. Too bad I missed it.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-05 03:06:19	@KassMcQ ah. Nice! Have fun.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-05 03:14:33	@salomey5 @CBCNews cool. Thx.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-02 22:34:20	@Keenan13Allen @NaeStokes4 @JoelleJames @Kameron3Jackson You in LA?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-02 23:04:35	@KassMcQ @ReneJHerrera @SpencerBGM So we are all trolls?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-05 15:09:36	@robstaboobuzzer not that I'm aware. And just a lot of drama between the contestants.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-05 15:18:16	@ChadKincaid1 @robstaboobuzzer Tony regarding Sarah. Sarah retweeting rude comments about Kass. Tasha retweeting an even worse tweet re Kass
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-05 21:01:15	@meehand Funny cause with all the recent earthquakes out here in CA I've been thinking I need to prepare a survival kit. Good tip :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-04 03:31:49	@FindMyNervous Yuck. Sometimes it's like that. My neurotic head is driving me nuts so I'm not in the best place either.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-04 04:10:27	@salomey5 wow. Lol. Something must be in the air.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-06 21:32:15	@GirlPakProds @furiousnothing Sour grapes.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-04 04:12:29	@salomey5 apparently Mexico just watched that season. So they're tweeting her.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-08 15:41:00	@truedorktimes they show her annoying Lindsey, but other than that she's even playing a great game so far.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-08 19:33:35	@GetOnSurvivor @truedorktimes clearly she isn't getting a winners edit
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-07 00:40:28	@FindMyNervous Can't wait! And I can't believe all the turn of events. #Fiona
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-08 04:10:11	@FindMyNervous Wow. I just watched the Shameless finale. Ugh to Frank. And I can't believe we finally saw Steve.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-08 04:24:09	@FindMyNervous And now we have to wait :( Good balance between some closure but keeping us coming back.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-07 01:36:57	@GutULykaFish @KassMcQ great now you just spoiled the show.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-07 01:38:08	@KassMcQ @PurpleRockPod well then you must work for blue shield too. I know you're the reason for 2 hr. hold times.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-06 04:18:38	@JeffProbst @timmullenhere Are you his agent? Lol. Seems he could do fine on his own.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-06 04:20:16	@JeffProbst @timmullenhere @mullentj2 WGA member now? Congrats on the sell.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-08 21:48:42	@KassMcQ @tony_vlachos have a great vacation!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-08 04:51:35	@aishabango @KassMcQ there's a diff between negative feedback and just plain rude comments and death threats... The dark side of soc media
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-09 05:47:38	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim ahem. I would like See's please.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-08 22:33:21	@dexterleekim where's furious nothing?!? Lol. Like your background :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-07 15:02:35	@kclark168 not a great way to start the week. No coffee?!?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-06 15:49:34	@KassMcQ @ChannonSarah Ha. I got Superior intellect and well adjusted. It hasn't seen me when I'm pissed off Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-06 16:00:52	@GutULykaFish @KassMcQ @ChannonSarah hehe. You or me?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-06 17:32:56	@GutULykaFish @KassMcQ @ChannonSarah Yes it's a V code in the back of the DSM. #TherapistHumor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-06 17:38:05	@GutULykaFish @KassMcQ @ChannonSarah well yeah. I assume most people would think the V in V code stands for something else... Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-06 17:41:13	@GutULykaFish @KassMcQ @ChannonSarah though the "superior intellect" coming from answering a few IQ ?'s correctly is suspect at best ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-06 17:45:25	@GutULykaFish @KassMcQ @ChannonSarah Shhh. It's supposed to be anonymous.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-06 18:49:03	@KassMcQ @DisneyCruise where will you be cruising?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-06 18:59:33	@KassMcQ @DisneyCruise Awesome! The Bahamas are beautiful. My dad is there now cruising on his sailboat. Not quite the same as Disney. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-06 20:40:04	@sophieGclarke thanks for approving me :) Saw you on that news clip and you were hilarious.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-09 18:49:33	@dexterleekim that does seem like the logical approach.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 03:06:25	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim she thought she was on the bottom
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 03:07:18	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim but I doubt the other 5 will get over it
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 03:08:13	@ReneJHerrera Not all woman are like Morgan. Please.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 03:15:01	@ReneJHerrera go ask your fianc√© ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 03:15:26	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim was wondering where the charmin palace was.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 03:19:31	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim didn't think that tweet was retweet worthy. Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 03:25:50	Woo lurking in the shadows is awesome! #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 03:35:04	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim :( you down on her. Not looking good for her. But your boy Spencer...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 03:40:30	Wow. @SpencerBGM is on fire. #Survivor "last person to win survivor" hmmm, not so much.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 03:42:21	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim He's killing it. Maybe her moves did him a favor.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 03:45:19	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim the first time I've hear product integration work.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 03:51:22	Ugh. Morgan. #survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 03:56:58	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim worst part I was happy to see her go until I realized... Oops
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 04:00:28	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds who from #survivor is allowed?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-09 18:26:01	Went to Trader Joes and they're out of green tea lemonade. What am I gonna do?!? #IGuessWater :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 04:02:36	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim when are we going to that other place with Ian?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 04:11:32	@ReneJHerrera Spoiled, entitled, everything handed to her, immature. Shall I go on? That came from somewhere... Still insufferable tho.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 04:18:21	@ReneJHerrera btw narcissists generally lack a sense of self so look outwards for validation/mirroring. Often defend vs deep wounds
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 04:18:58	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim she's the only dark horse on #nitsirk
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 04:20:09	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim No Morgan for lunch. LJ is good. Woo. Oh, no J'Tia either.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 04:21:25	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim or the chips.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 04:22:44	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim let's do Dex's bday elsewhere in case it takes a while for all of our scheds to fit.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 05:18:02	@SurvivorWiki @Survivor_Tweet it's fake. But you're supposed to know that right ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-13 20:02:51	@Lyndzzz Really nice meeting you this weekend!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-12 23:47:44	Volunteered today. Wine and mingling tonight. And best of all got to see @goofygal1171 in person! #RealityRally http://t.co/8dR53R9JCL

36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-13 06:45:15	@ReneJHerrera @goofygal1171 Haha. Or maybe we just diagnosed you ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-13 06:48:55	Damn @goofygal1171 we look cute as he'll and I'm taller than you ;) http://t.co/TGEIJQnttO

36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-14 17:12:54	@Hayden_Moss Missed seeing you at Reality Rally. Maybe another time. Hope you're well.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-14 17:13:57	@KassMcQ Hey hope your happiest cruise on earth was awesome!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-14 17:17:04	@TinaWesson Very nice to meet you this weekend Tina. http://t.co/duj2Rgyqqi
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-14 17:20:21	It was awesome meeting some of my favorite Survivor players, but being able to volunteer was the most rewarding. #RealityRally @realityrally
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 17:22:41	@DaltonRoss Survivor has been good. But I assume Idol most likely sucks.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-14 18:27:36	@KassMcQ Awesome! Pays to know peeps in high places, lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 18:15:25	@BrandonFederow2 See you then Brandon! Looking forward to it!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-14 01:44:03	@robcesternino Hey Rob, Dex and I had a great time chatting with you last night! Hope you and your bro had a great time. @dexterleekim #RHAP
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-14 03:48:15	@bmstapley O'Hare seems to always suck. Btw, Dexter and I loved getting to meet you and chat with you a bit.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-14 03:54:39	@goofygal1171 Yes, finally :) Had a great time catching up with you in person too and getting to meet Brad.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-14 03:55:05	@goofygal1171 what can we say? We clean up well ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-14 03:55:58	@goofygal1171 @TinaWesson @dexterleekim @bmstapley Very fun! And super cold!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-14 03:59:16	@goofygal1171 btw, I posted a couple of pics on your fb page, but have some that you may want that I'll send you
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-10 21:45:40	@robstaboobuzzer mine too. *ashamed* but thanks for the heads up :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-11 20:39:37	@goofygal1171 does that mean no breakfast that morning?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-11 22:47:04	@KatieCollinsSur Yay. Get to meet you and @TinaWesson tomorrow.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-15 21:04:22	@PSheppardTV fun and interesting discussion with you Sat. night. :) Maybe I'll run into you on the Westside sometime.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-15 21:08:49	@Lyndzzz I'm actually in Culver City, but I was thinking of West Hollywood when I said that ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-15 21:12:18	@Lyndzzz yeah I figured ;) I'm not far from West Hollywood and Beverly Hills.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-11 23:05:22	Volunteering at Reality Rally tomorrow. Looking forward to meeting some of my favorite #Survivor players.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-12 01:42:55	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim wish you were coming with us Deb!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-12 14:47:43	@robstaboobuzzer come out and say hi. I'm headed there now :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 03:06:54	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim since you have the majority left it was bound to happen. And of course Tony at the head.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 03:16:48	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim proving why he's a threat. Doesn't look good for him tonight so far.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 03:21:25	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I believe that's called the hantz phenomena
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 03:26:31	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim one of tsokolate may be in trouble. You nervous?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 03:33:43	Geez their brains really must be fried in that color challenge. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 03:55:50	Well that sucked :( Bye LJ. Guess there wasn't enough story arch in his edit. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 03:56:15	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim that was poopy. Coming from poop stains himself.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 03:57:48	@JeffProbst Cool. Than I still have a shot. Real desire is not a problem.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 03:59:16	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim did you see previews. Uh oh Woo eeek
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 04:01:13	@ReneJHerrera so not enough story arch for winners edit. Maybe Tony, Spencer... Anyone else?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 04:03:52	@ReneJHerrera will depend on if they find our his lies. Which should happen at Ponderosa but maybe not before.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 04:08:27	@ReneJHerrera yeah it's kinda nice not completely knowing at this point. Crazy season.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 04:09:43	@JeffProbst as long as they aren't overdone or would get voting. Once in a while is fun to play along with.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 04:12:02	@GirlPakProds @DIRECTV probs?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 04:21:38	@GirlPakProds @DIRECTV ugh. They sound nearly as bad as Blue Shield who's ripping everyone off.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 04:23:57	@GirlPakProds no. Your insurance rocks. :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-15 21:05:39	@Lyndzzz you up in my neck of the woods? Come down below the hill and you might even see more celebs ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-17 18:18:35	@robcesternino turning too much to the hantz playbook. Jury won't be happy with all the lies.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-16 03:23:35	@ReneJHerrera Completely awesome! Crushed a 6-pack on her forehead.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-18 05:16:14	@GirlPakProds I can drive one too.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-18 05:17:28	@GirlPakProds I just realized that was on tonight. Missed tv. Barely know what day it is.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-21 22:17:35	@robstaboobuzzer will do.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-20 03:21:32	@KassMcQ @idkconner who's the queen? Seriously curious.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-20 03:24:40	@idkconner @KassMcQ aha. Interesting.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-20 03:28:07	@idkconner @KassMcQ aren't they bff's now? Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-22 19:47:54	@KassMcQ love how CBS spells "losing" as "loosing" on the caption. Ugh. #petpeeve
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-20 04:59:23	@KassMcQ @idkconner well actually if you look at my twitter handle... Haha
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-26 23:23:14	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim who were you really looking for?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-26 23:26:59	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Ha. I guess you weren't the only one. Find any good pics ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-24 03:38:50	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim If winning the million was just based on challenges, Tasha would front runner. She's killing it.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-24 03:55:13	Good call at reading Spencer @KassMcQ
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-24 03:57:35	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds yes but at least that one has a chance. A small one, but still a chance.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-27 15:46:29	@ReneJHerrera you sure that wasn't the booze?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-24 15:55:22	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim worst idol ever.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-24 19:48:33	@FindMyNervous awesome. And no need to apologize.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-29 14:46:19	@goofygal1171 My heads been swimming as well ;) Where u off this weekend? Hope you're well too :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-28 21:32:50	@meehand definitely not a fan of the single ply.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-29 17:33:51	@goofygal1171 @ToughMudder Cool. You'll have to let me know how the conf goes. And I bet you're looking forward to some down time :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-29 17:34:49	@goofygal1171 Doing ok mostly... Some tough moments of course ;) Thanks for asking :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-01 15:06:11	@goofygal1171 @missfoxytasha guess you were human then. And hungry.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-01 15:06:44	@GirlPakProds certainly your game to lose.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-30 18:52:10	@FindMyNervous that's why she can fill us in on all the BB scoop. Insomnia serves a purpose ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-04-29 05:53:16	@goofygal1171 It feels like it's been a while since I've talked to you, tho it hasn't been that long. #timewarp
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-01 21:28:47	@JustinFWalter @jerrimanthey @ABTVSurvivor @RyanACarrillo Why is it your last?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-01 21:38:52	@RyanACarrillo @JustinFWalter @jerrimanthey @ABTVSurvivor Bummer. But I guess it's quality probs ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-01 21:58:22	@JustinFWalter @jerrimanthey @ABTVSurvivor @RyanACarrillo hmmm. When will that be?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-01 03:16:41	@ReneJHerrera yep. The gigs up.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-01 03:17:42	Food porn on Survivor. Is that a first?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-01 03:20:56	@KassMcQ what kind of pie?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-01 03:25:59	@KassMcQ yum!! That could get messy.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-01 03:27:18	@goofygal1171 he's such a surfer dude. Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-01 03:33:16	I feel like this is d√©j√† vu. Do they even try to get creative with hiding the idols? #survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-01 03:39:50	Tasha has earned the title Challenge Beast! Wow!! #survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-01 03:42:42	@goofygal1171 @missfoxytasha Difference Denise is did you feel you were going home? Or was syrup that powerful? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-01 05:33:29	@KassMcQ It's called self-respect and not putting up with that bullshit from the peeps who hide behind a screen. Good for you!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-01 05:57:17	@truedorktimes his luck can't be that bad if he's still there. Or I suppose you can attribute that to good game play.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 00:37:50	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Although I love #1 and 2, #3 made me literally lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-09 00:45:12	@alliepohevitz :( sorry it's rough
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-09 03:06:58	@TBMWolverine yes. No AJ moves here! Phew!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-09 03:15:54	Welcome Jason Verrett to the Bolts! Definitely need a player at corner. #Chargers
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-09 03:18:30	@TBMWolverine nightmares
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 03:21:18	Hard to tell the dynamic between Spencer and Kass, but they work well together in challenges. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 03:34:21	Maybe they should've helped Woo come up with a cover story. Terrible liar. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 03:57:42	@KassMcQ @tony_vlachos good on you for admitting when you're wrong.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 03:58:01	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Fierce
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 04:02:55	@alliepohevitz @YungWoo23 there is a dreamy quality about him
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 04:04:15	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds @kallenqueen do you have any left? Oh and wrong twitter acct
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 04:05:09	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I've been riding my 1 player for weeks!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 04:09:49	@GirlPakProds @SpencerBGM @tony_vlachos @YungWoo23 @dexterleekim many chips and tacos
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 04:10:19	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Tasha was definitely a threat. Proved her worthiness
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 04:17:11	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim if there's a final 3. But Spencer wins if he's in finals
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 04:18:45	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds maybe you wouldn't. He was dispicable
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 04:35:47	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Ha. Love it! And I think you may get your wish.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 04:37:35	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Phew. At least you have your standards, haha
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 16:20:14	Yahoo Mail wtf did you do? You just broke my email and I need to send something. Suck much?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 17:55:22	@TBMWolverine editing setting up the winner?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 17:57:00	Felt good to sweat. #hitthegym
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 17:57:47	@Lyndzzz @YungWoo23 So is this you watching it real time?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 18:03:31	@missfoxytasha Sorry about your boot. You said you made Survivor on your 3rd try. Had you gotten a call back with your 1st two apps?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 20:26:10	@JeffProbst I'm not knocking it yet, but it would mean no finale weekend :( Plus work gets in the way
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-08 20:27:53	@salomey5 what have I missed?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-09 21:02:21	@gordonholmes although it's not surprising, it's still a bummer.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-09 21:04:35	@ReneJHerrera my guess is David. One of the few I saw
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-09 21:10:53	@ReneJHerrera I didn't think so but she seemed either annoyed or uncomfortable.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-09 23:08:14	@ReneJHerrera @robcesternino @nofate1991 @JohnMCochran I thought that was all resolved at the finale? You're still blocked... Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-09 23:11:01	@UTKevinAcee Yep. Seems a lot more sincere than Roby. Like where his head is.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-11 15:27:35	@KassMcQ Hey see you went spring cleaning and I'm the goodwill box. I was wondering when I wouldn't make the cut, lol. Happy Mom's Day :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-11 15:46:51	Happy Mother's Day to those who still live and those who are gone from our lives. You're still remembered and cherished.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-10 17:55:08	@robstaboobuzzer Been there. Done that. Hope it helps.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-11 03:04:12	@GirlPakProds Jordan or Bananas? Which team are you on?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-11 03:06:20	@CherylStrayed Wish I could've been there. Would've been with good company :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-14 14:44:57	@realityblurred Most recent rumors suggest season 30 won't be returnees after all. Have you heard that recently?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-14 14:46:09	@KassMcQ 2 weeks left! And then...normalcy?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-14 14:52:22	@realityblurred Prob 1-2 weeks ago. So maybe they've decided to go back to returnees. They def seem to be a fickle bunch ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-16 01:16:04	@Lyndzzz is this her last episode?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 03:25:16	Of course Tony knows how to speak  llama. Lmfao. #survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-16 05:14:12	@Lyndzzz @IamSandraOh One of the best characters on TV, of course played by an amazing actress. Goodbye to Christina :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 04:02:21	Spencer wins right? David and Goliath. Underdog. Has to be... #survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 04:02:54	@ReneJHerrera which part are you questioning?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 04:12:46	@ReneJHerrera I'm bummed I have to watch west coast airing :( too early on a weeknight to get home to watch earlier
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 04:21:08	@truedorktimes I'm up in LA so we're fine. Grew up down there and have family, but they're ok
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 04:24:29	@ReneJHerrera prob won't be happening for me this time either. Come back for the fall season
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-16 21:07:47	@robstaboobuzzer not sure what to think of this ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 03:39:11	Advice. Learn how to do slide puzzles before going on #Survivor. #ouch
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 03:57:50	Woo made a move! And @KassMcQ is the last woman standing!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 03:58:13	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds Yep. Last one to pick. First one out.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 04:00:23	@ReneJHerrera yep. My team is out as of tonight. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 04:08:37	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds @missfoxytasha anything can happen if Tyler Perry suggests it
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 04:10:05	@ReneJHerrera that is weird. Anyone know why?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 04:11:30	@KassMcQ been fun watching you play this season. Unfortunately I won't know who wins until 10pm next week cause can't watch early feed :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 04:15:30	@truedorktimes you're down in SD right? You ok where you are?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 04:20:30	@ReneJHerrera I thought about it for a min ;) Wish it was Sun. Prob won't be going to the parties either. Next time maybe...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 05:39:26	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim 3 vs 1. I think the odds are in your favor.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 05:43:23	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim what you want it all?!? Haha.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 05:50:09	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim funny how it made no impact in the game (except for just being an extra idol)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-17 04:03:25	@alliepohevitz Aha, you found a place... Where you moving to?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 15:04:02	@GutULykaFish @KassMcQ Oh funny man.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 15:04:52	@GutULykaFish @KassMcQ agreed. Kass did the work, but with Woo, you never know...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 15:21:24	@truedorktimes I'm glad the TP idol didn't influence the game. Foiled their own plans, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-15 16:21:20	@DaltonRoss @truedorktimes no nice weather right now. He's battling fires and I'm melting from the heat!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-18 15:18:12	@TrishHegarty Hi you said you applied several times before you got on Survivor. Had you gotten call backs from casting in the years prior?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-18 18:57:25	@KassMcQ Hey if I don't talk to you before, try to have a blast at the finale! I'll be watching west coast time so you'll be done by then ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-17 15:23:48	@FindMyNervous happy birthday! Which decade are you going to choose?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-16 01:16:51	@Lyndzzz one of the few left. Lol. But I won't see it til later
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-16 01:47:14	@jerrimanthey and you come on twitter? You should know better, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-18 03:37:23	@JeffProbst I assume just east coast right?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-19 15:35:00	So I really did hear "fuck" on Mad Men last night. Couldn't believe the networks left that in.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-19 03:11:20	@ReneJHerrera that sounds dirty
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-19 05:34:37	@JeffProbst Looking back is there anything Kass would have done differently in the game?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-19 21:18:47	@theronster yeah thought about that. But not HBO type cable. Still surprised.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-20 03:39:15	@GirlPakProds @JohnMCochran Ha. I already figured with amount of episodes he was ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-19 22:46:17	@GirlPakProds @robcesternino @JohnMCochran Yay. What was the context? Cochran being a member? Is he yet?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-20 03:32:38	@JohnMCochran @GirlPakProds Congrats! Which is better? Winning Survivor or paying dues? Ha. I'm tagging along on the tour. Deb's the best ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-20 04:10:48	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds and Deb will quit Survivor then and there
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-20 04:10:02	@JeffProbst @stephenfishbach you really can never win, can you?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-20 00:27:52	@sophieGclarke Hey Sophie, did you apply for Survivor? If so, did you get on first try?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-20 02:17:04	@GirlPakProds @robcesternino @JohnMCochran depends which website. The one I work on or the one Rob works on? #RHAP #WGA
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-20 03:48:59	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim emailed back. And something goes very wrong of Tsokolate doesn't win.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-20 15:33:33	@KassMcQ Drive safe. Have fun. And no fights ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-20 22:26:15	@truedorktimes will you be the only person left watching west coast time tomorrow?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-20 22:27:36	@truedorktimes well, I'll be here with ya. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-20 17:38:22	@meehand Awesome! That's part of what has always attracted me to #Survivor and why I've wanted to be a part of it.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-20 16:04:36	@meehand Awww, bringing you treats. Tell CityKitty, next time chocolate would suffice.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-20 16:09:52	@meehand A year later. Does time heal all wounds?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-20 20:25:02	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim @tony_vlachos Yeah. Happened earlier this year. Weird the story comes out now
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-21 17:10:22	@meehand Lol. But you did get second place prize money ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-20 22:17:14	@KassMcQ Welcome to LaLa land! I'll wave to you from afar ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 22:27:39	@JohnMCochran @SpencerBGM well you still have 100k more followers than Spencer, so at least give him that ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 22:36:02	@Lyndzzz Although I was rooting for Spencer, I think Tony is a good winner. He played hard and earned it. You?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 22:39:22	@Lyndzzz Yeah Woo is awesome, but not so cutthroat. Definitely awesome season! Here's to newbies ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 22:44:23	@Lyndzzz hanging out for season 30s cast? You mean here?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 22:48:04	@Lyndzzz haha. Yes, it will be a while. Maybe eventually you'll see me play ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 22:51:21	@Lyndzzz just a couple of times. Probst liked the tapes, but no call backs :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 23:00:04	@Lyndzzz I know it sux! And I fit a very small demographic But there's no reason I shouldn't be on, so they need to get their ass in gear ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-21 16:53:35	Why does @SpencerBGM have at least double the twitter followers as the rest of the cast? Everybody love the underdog? #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-21 17:16:56	In exactly 7 hours and 15 min I'll be on social media lockdown. Oh the sacrifices. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-21 18:37:26	@robstaboobuzzer yeah you gotta coms out next time! Need my buds!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-21 21:02:00	@realityblurred Simple. They're reactionary. 29 is BvW &amp; 30 is now newbies cause they were hits. They change their minds often &amp; last min.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 03:22:54	Everybody really does seem to get along, says @JeffProbst Uh, not so much. They must be on their best behavior #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 03:46:04	I absolutely love Woo when he's tired and hungry. #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 03:59:14	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim ok. 1 down. You've got 2 left
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 04:08:26	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim now you're just bragging.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 03:10:21	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim for 2 hours and 5 min
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 03:11:56	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim truly awesome!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 03:36:55	Omg! What a kick-ass comeback. @KassMcQ Never give up!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 03:37:42	@goofygal1171 @Survivor_Tweet you really did climb him. One of the coolest moments on tv!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 03:53:30	Ah @SpencerBGM I thought you were gonna take the whole thing. Sorry man. You played a good game.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 04:35:01	I love that certain people were wrong about the final 2. Those who think they've got all the info for spoilers. :) #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 04:35:41	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim winning all around. Good job
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 04:47:46	Worst part about @KassMcQ not making final two is we didn't get to hear her lawyer her opponent. #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 04:59:50	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim @TrishHegarty that was intense. But I get it. I feel ya Trish.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 05:03:12	@SpencerBGM Love your respect for the game. Love em or hate em, Tony played his ass off. Good speech. #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 05:05:58	@goofygal1171 @Survivor_Tweet any PTSD symptoms for ya? Haha
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 05:13:31	Congrats @tony_vlachos!!! You played your ass off and earned this win. #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 05:15:12	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim stupid part is I tried to give you Morgan for Tony and you didn't budge. Guess you knew what you were doing
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 05:17:22	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim poor woo. And Tony is nervous right now.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 05:27:54	@alliepohevitz I'm with ya. It's painful for those who want to play so bad...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 05:40:08	@wochnick @YungWoo23 yeah that's a tough one. But hey, he gets 100k
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-21 23:29:05	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera @jeremywoodsbb Yes please. Gotta come out cause I need my buds!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 04:12:45	Wow. Nail biter. Congrats Woo! I bet your psyched! Sorry @KassMcQ  #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 04:12:51	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I think both your teams won. Damn
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 04:17:20	Last episode foreshadows a Woo win. What about all the episodes before? #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 04:29:02	Wow. I thought taking Kass was in the bag! Love this season! Never know what's gonna happen. #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 04:30:34	Sorry @KassMcQ Thought you were making the final 2 for sure. Damn I bet that 1/2 sec haunts you. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 04:31:08	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Well congrats is in order! You should get bonus pts for having both players in the final.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 04:51:35	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim let's do it! Woooo
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 05:33:48	Respect @YungWoo23 Can't argue with your beliefs. #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 05:42:17	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer Ok. It's much better watching early and going to the finale party. Next time #NoPrisoners
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 05:46:17	@truedorktimes it wouldn't be a survivor finale without a silly waste of a segment
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 05:51:46	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds Haha. It's so very true. You and Woo have so much in common.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-22 16:20:53	@alliepohevitz @ThisIsSurvivor it's super easy for the web person to change that language. It hasn't been updated for months! Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-24 04:02:05	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim So I have met Ian's wife before. Must've been a while ago. Next up. Your sole survivor lunch!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-24 14:51:56	@robstaboobuzzer @GetOnSurvivor it's legit. I saw pics from last year. A ton of Survivors. And 2nd year that Denise is taking her family.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-23 18:04:02	No #Survivor. No football. What's a girl to do? #getoffthecouch
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-25 01:57:33	@KassMcQ Hey Kass, you home safe and sound? How was the finale? Seemed like a whirlwind! You looked great btw!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-25 15:49:30	@mikeskupin if it smells bad time to part ways.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-28 03:34:59	@KassMcQ Happy Summer to you Kass! Does your practice tend to slow down in the summer?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-26 21:57:54	@KassMcQ @robcesternino I love the feet at the bottom of the photo, lol. :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-26 22:09:26	@FindMyNervous can't go wrong with REM :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-26 21:55:48	It's a lazy Memorial Day. I almost don't know what to do with myself. #IGuessI'llManage
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-28 16:20:11	Maya Angelou was one of the first "serious" writers I liked as a kid. RIP and thank you for sharing your gifts.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-29 15:49:25	@SP4fan @meehand Tweeting someone you don't know about their children is beyond low class. How bout looking in the mirror at YOUR behavior
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-29 15:51:31	@meehand @ReneJHerrera Dawn you kick ass and it's clear you weren't taking in the vitriol in a way you may have before.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-29 16:12:58	@ReneJHerrera @meehand Lol. Dawn don't listen to that Renee. He's nothing but trouble, haha.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-29 16:16:45	@meehand @ReneJHerrera Of course :) My brother Rene's just upset that I don't get blocked on twitter like he does. Lol. #troublemaker
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-28 22:53:23	@SpencerBGM Are you the type that keeps track of exactly how many followers you have?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-29 22:20:35	@KassMcQ Fun facts by Kass. Keep 'em coming. :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-30 04:35:13	@cohuttaMTV you really are a sweet soul. Nice to see in this day of reality tv.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-05-31 01:18:33	@goofygal1171 @SK848 Denise you should read non-work related fiction to decompress! Lol. I have the same problem...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-02 21:31:16	@alliepohevitz @EWMandiBierly Crazy it's happened on both BvW seasons. Bummer for the duo who couldn't play :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-03 01:52:32	@GirlPakProds @east_of_west_la Plus she was kinda whack.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-03 00:32:09	@ashes2ashes13 You are my feed ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-05 07:05:31	@ReneJHerrera If she's making fun of Mexican candy, she's making fun of you ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-05 07:10:07	@KassMcQ @tony_vlachos Tony brought notoriety to the llama. Love the llama!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-12 16:24:12	@KassMcQ Wordpress.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-12 18:35:10	@SpencerBGM @MalcolmWHW Is that really an indication of cool?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-13 18:42:53	First time I've had a good workout in a while. Damn that feels good. Maybe ready for mud run next week? Maybe not.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-13 20:57:41	@BBGossip @ashes2ashes13 She's just gearing up ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-13 21:26:03	@ashes2ashes13 @BBGossip Isn't that how it is every year? And then we get sucked in...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-16 00:48:20	@ReneJHerrera Ha. Love it
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-16 01:07:58	@KassMcQ you ever choose a blog? Hope all is well and you're enjoying the summer.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-16 22:22:25	@goofygal1171 2 peas in a pod :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-18 05:48:19	@KassMcQ @robcesternino Ah damn. You were down here? Should've come say hi. Guess I'll have to listen to the podcast ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-17 05:08:22	@DaltonRoss Funny. I was just talking about that being like Utopia where it was supposed to go on indefinitely...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-18 19:19:16	@ashes2ashes13 Geez. Convoluted.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-18 19:27:43	@KassMcQ @prAna Wow. Did you know that's where your wedding ring was?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-18 20:02:37	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Mozza tomorrow. And then we need to plan your victory lunch, or our losers lunch ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-17 19:48:53	@goofygal1171 @DolfinSwim For someone who didn't have sun for nearly 6 months, how are you so tan?!?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-20 15:29:13	@robstaboobuzzer @TheRealKBlack25 @KatySulfridge @KatEdorsson @RHAPfan21 Happy Friday to you buzzer :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-20 17:22:03	@teetomterrific Congrats!!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-22 05:38:59	@ReneJHerrera weird that it's happened again. Guess they do it on purpose?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-22 05:40:44	@RHAPfan21 who knew he'd become a favorite of mine.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-22 05:43:03	@RHAPfan21 Lol. That was a fun season.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-20 05:30:41	@UTKevinAcee Interesting how our perceptions are of certain players. Thanks for the facts.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-20 05:34:55	@ReneJHerrera so marriage is soon. Honeymoon after?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-20 05:40:38	@hamsterwatch Ugh. Frankie kind of reminds me of that character if Parks and Rec.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-20 05:43:13	@ashes2ashes13 Seriously ugh. Insufferable. #bb16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-20 05:45:40	@ReneJHerrera Definitely post pics. Before and after :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-23 15:13:00	@FindMyNervous lol at that episode
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-22 23:34:57	@ChadKincaid1 how did you meet?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-23 18:21:40	@LT_21 Happy Birthday LT!! Hope you're having an awesome day.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-25 20:33:12	@ColtonCumbie My heart goes out to you. Please stay close to family and friends.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-23 23:21:38	@FindMyNervous what do they stare at? You?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-23 23:24:22	@FindMyNervous Ugh. Creepy. Take a pic of them and post here ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-25 21:53:29	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Yes. Terrible and heartbreaking. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-24 16:45:09	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim When would you like to celebrate your win? I can do next Thurs (not this one)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-26 04:01:48	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim sounds good. I didn't realize it was the 4th next week. Crazy!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-26 04:12:33	@teetomterrific what you think so far?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-26 14:56:53	@KassMcQ @CBSBigBrother it's addicting and good during the summer when nothing else is on.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-26 20:12:35	@ReneJHerrera if you want to post them here, I'll critique ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-26 21:19:04	@BBGossip inflated ego?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-26 23:22:08	@teetomterrific definitely already annoyed by the Asian girl.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-26 23:51:55	@teetomterrific yes! I actually like how they split it cause we got to know each person more
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-25 01:54:24	@ChadKincaid1 reports are he died. Not sure anything more. :( terrible
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-25 01:57:05	@ChadKincaid1 yeah I hope it's not true too. So sad if it is.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-25 02:14:06	@mikeskupin thx for posting :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-25 02:17:51	@salomey5 @mrsredsox0923 @L_Ho_2012 very sad. My heart hurts.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-24 21:18:23	@UTgehlken @JasonLaCanfora Love it!!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-25 02:45:13	My heart goes out to @ColtonCumbie and the rest of Caleb's family. May Caleb RIP.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-25 03:20:39	@RHAPfan21 it unfortunately is. Extremely sad.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-25 03:23:24	@RHAPfan21 yeah it seems it was a work accident. By all account he did seem like a lovely person.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-25 03:29:13	@SurvivorPenner yes per multiple sources. Very sad.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-25 00:28:35	@BFlowers24 Welcome to the Chargers! So excited!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-27 05:22:06	@ashes2ashes13 the oldest is always a target :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-27 05:24:43	@ashes2ashes13 hopefully the girl is the target. Are these Caleb's or Frankie's noms?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-27 05:28:18	@ashes2ashes13 I would've favorited this but then it would've looked like I was happy with Caleb. And oddly Frankie isn't killing me yet
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-27 17:06:51	At #Survivor open casting call. It's gotta go better than last time. #choke Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-27 17:12:48	@robstaboobuzzer thanks! :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-27 17:15:21	@robstaboobuzzer yeah we just have 1 minute so I have to keep it concise ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-27 17:15:36	@RHAPfan21 thanks!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-27 17:16:27	@robstaboobuzzer yeah it's super fast
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-27 17:18:57	@robstaboobuzzer now I'm getting nervous!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-27 20:30:18	@sophieGclarke you may have to travel a little farther than the airport. Not much around there.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-29 22:15:26	Love this. #LikeAGirl http://t.co/KB3BiIETBT
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-28 22:25:52	@hamsterwatch Has Caleb made any racist remarks since the first week that you know of?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-27 14:13:12	@ReneJHerrera have a great and amazing wedding my bro!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-28 00:28:10	@ashes2ashes13 woohoo!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-28 00:29:49	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera @danacomiskey Wow. Beautiful. Both of you :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-28 05:17:23	@RHAPfan21 cool. what do you live about him so much?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-28 05:29:07	@alliepohevitz so I went to an open casting call and kicked ass while shaking like I was on speed. Does casting actually watch these? #ihope
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-30 04:09:53	Big Brother rules according to Devin: Rat out your alliance the first day it's formed. Ugh. #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-30 04:17:49	I'm actually very surprised about how much I like Frankie in the BB house. Don't judge a book by its YouTube videos. #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-30 04:20:20	Am I the only one who thinks Caleb looks like Jeremy Renner? #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-30 04:30:09	@ashes2ashes13 miss the old method. More suspense for the houseguests.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-30 04:34:36	@sophieGclarke stay off twitter
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-28 15:45:36	So serene before we ran like scared little girls from the water. ;) @dexterleekim http://t.co/kSAcMmRsVI
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-01 05:38:09	@ashes2ashes13 @BBGossip why is he so popular on the feeds?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-01 16:58:30	@ashes2ashes13 weren't you supposed to go to sleep?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-01 17:03:45	@ashes2ashes13 Omg. Do you function for the 3 months? I would be a zombie. And not a fun one, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-01 19:41:45	@ashes2ashes13 watched some BB After Dark. Starting to see why Donny is loved.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-01 19:44:01	@meehand bummer :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-01 19:45:13	@ashes2ashes13 Seems to me #BB16 has a much better cast overall than BB15 from the little I've seen. What's the thought out there?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-03 03:33:26	I officially love Donny! Oh, and Devin is a tool. #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-03 03:51:46	I'm not sure I've ever seen anyone who knows less about the game than Joey. Yeesh. #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-03 05:10:52	@MalcolmWHW awesome!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-03 05:13:52	@gordonholmes definitely more nutrients.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-03 05:31:18	@alliepohevitz Funny, I think she was already approached about this show, but didn't have friends who would do it. See I know talent ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-06-30 21:50:13	Woohoo! Community is saved! #SixSeasonsAndaMovie http://t.co/XQhnayEp3m
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-02 05:18:11	@sonnyjohl @KassMcQ Love the woman inadvertently photo bombing behind you Kass. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-02 05:21:03	@ashes2ashes13 Right. Wasn't he the one that didn't know what cardio meant? But he's good to look at :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-02 05:45:44	@KassMcQ @sonnyjohl hopefully she gets a copy of the pic too!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-02 05:54:18	@playdots Love this game. Two levels left and I'll be going through withdrawal! ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-04 04:14:05	I certainly am all for fighting to stay in the house, but "Alex" just makes me uncomfortable. #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-04 04:56:51	Although I hate the concept of Team America, I love that Donny was chosen. #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-04 05:12:45	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Hey, so what about next Fri or the following Monday for lunch?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-05 19:06:19	@robstaboobuzzer Lol. Didn't your mom say if you make a face it will stay that way? #nicelook
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-02 17:13:30	@alliepohevitz does it matter if they're "sane" or not?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-02 17:25:05	@alliepohevitz haha. Very true. I'll send her the info!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-05 01:12:03	@goofygal1171 @theabimaria Wait Denise, you were watching sports?!? ;) Happy 4th!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-05 04:02:30	@dribbleglass fun patriotic drink, but what's in it?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-02 18:36:04	@alliepohevitz does she need to get friends to do it with her? She def would be a reality tv personality.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-06 05:55:28	@ashes2ashes13 @hamsterwatch @prettyplainjo Unfortunately a lot of psychiatrists prescribe addictive meds to addicts...It's def a problem.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-03 17:35:18	@alliepohevitz Turns out she did message you. Be on the lookout. She goes by MC :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-03 18:51:22	@ashes2ashes13 oooh. Fun. Bummer I missed. So does Frankie not drink now?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-03 18:54:52	@ashes2ashes13 it's not a problem until he starts drinking. Lol. But, cool if it's really not.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-07 14:55:52	@BBGossip Damn. On both accounts.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-06 20:00:42	Biggest surprise of the season is Frankie. He's not all persona and I actually like him. #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-04 01:52:46	@ReneJHerrera much better than last season!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-06 22:49:37	@MalcolmWHW @WayfaringLive you found your home ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-07 00:08:32	@goofygal1171 what does he have to do for this one?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-07 21:27:59	@MalcolmWHW well if you love me forever...ok. #WFAstronaut
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-07 21:32:20	@hamsterwatch exactly. Good question.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-07 03:54:58	Love that a lot of the cast aren't just one note. And love that these men aren't afraid to show emotion. #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-07 23:07:41	@ashes2ashes13 F'ing love this season. Everybody's freaking out. Except Donny ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-07 04:23:12	@ashes2ashes13 As a feed watcher do you think it dramatically changes the story?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-07 04:25:29	@ashes2ashes13 that sux then. I wonder why they do that :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-08 01:35:09	@alliepohevitz @TkicksAss Awesome. Then you can watch mine Allie... If I'm so lucky ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-09 06:34:05	@ashes2ashes13 lol. These boys with their footwear. :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-09 14:32:14	@ashes2ashes13 Lol. I wake up to read a slew of tweets by you... "OMG Devin, STFU Devin, You're killing me Devin..." #TorturedByDevin
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-09 15:55:27	#WFGorilla ... Of course
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-11 04:43:18	Even after I was reminded she was on the show, a Victoria sighting still shocked me. Is she the equivalent to purple Kelly? #BB16 #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-11 06:09:38	@CherylStrayed :) you rock
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-09 23:30:52	@ashes2ashes13 BB feeds are like that commercial "this is your brain on drugs, any questions?"
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-10 03:54:26	No sleep and all slop makes Zach a dull boy. Or at least on the block :( #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-10 04:02:09	@BBGossip when did Devin get word? Today? It's a full time job just trying to keep up with tweets!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-10 04:02:26	@BBGossip btw, thank you for all you do :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-11 21:24:08	@BBGossip BB rule 101: Don't play with your emotions.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-12 15:50:57	@Lyndzzz can he solve level 461 of candy crush. That level is the death of me.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-12 15:52:25	@RHAPfan21 if you're 14 in the 1980's
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-12 15:56:07	@RHAPfan21 @robstaboobuzzer Donny!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-10 22:29:51	Exactly! ‚Äú@Chargers: All you need to know about the one and only @Keenan13Allen. http://t.co/Z7Y8MuaX99 http://t.co/X5W9xt4w6a‚Äù
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-12 19:50:58	@ashes2ashes13 Yep. IV will do it. Miserable.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-13 23:20:49	@RHAPfan21 why is it looking so bad?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-13 23:22:31	@RHAPfan21 hopefully something will change by then. Was it the Americas thing that screwed him?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-14 03:33:35	Love you Donny, but loose lips sink ships. :( #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-14 00:01:42	@RHAPfan21 that makes me sad :( I don't think I can handle Donny being upset.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-14 00:03:29	@ashes2ashes13 So how is Donny's position in the house? Read that things have turned for the worse with him. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-14 00:04:26	@ashes2ashes13 ok good. :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-14 04:10:06	@Hayden_Moss Yep. BB 101: Don't play with your emotions!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-14 04:29:43	@ashes2ashes13 damn. They caught me. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-15 14:57:02	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim You won fair and square! Llama, llama #survivor http://t.co/moLjfwZAKz
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-15 15:06:28	@robstaboobuzzer good luck!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-15 21:30:09	@BBGossip Dreamy. Does he shave his armpits too?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-16 15:19:28	@goofygal1171 Hey Denise! You have any boundary pushing clients lately? It's been a while, I almost forgot how they can seep into the psyche
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-16 18:01:53	@goofygal1171 Ha! Beer=good. Yes totally worth it :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-16 18:02:21	@ReneJHerrera @goofygal1171 Lol. You weren't supposed to out yourself! I was trying to keep it confidential ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-16 17:51:40	@goofygal1171 Good  remedy :) Crazy job we have sometimes, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-14 21:18:35	@Hayden_Moss @DivvieApp can you tell me what it is?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-16 22:12:09	@ReneJHerrera @Hayden_Moss @DivvieApp I'm wondering what it is too!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-17 03:47:02	#oldmanbeatdown Lol. Donny killed it! #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-17 05:23:11	@ashes2ashes13 A lot of potty talk in the house.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-14 23:58:36	@hamsterwatch memories :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-17 02:44:20	Started watching Derek on Netflix. Surprised at how tender and heartwarming it is. Well done.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-17 21:55:03	@alliepohevitz Yeah. Your old. Rolling my eyes. Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-18 04:48:22	Devin had to go but I respect his exit. #goodsport #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-19 02:29:13	@BBGossip She has really imploded. Not built for the game?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-19 03:19:10	Ok I know I'm now being snarky, but you would think the studios in LA could book a better cover band. Sorry. Eh, not sorry.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-20 22:02:34	@FindMyNervous Personal question... How do you have time for the feeds and no sleep? Thankfully you do for people like me :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-20 18:56:44	@BBGossip why do people think it's abuse? If that's the case then solitary with the crazy music is abuse too.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-20 19:36:09	@ashes2ashes13 I'm impressed that she's keeping at it. Prob won't help her but shows heart.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-21 00:25:02	@ashes2ashes13 Gotta give props to Brittany! Something to be said about not quitting! #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-18 19:48:57	@ashes2ashes13 good. Keep the heat off backdooring Donny.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-20 04:14:51	@ashes2ashes13 I was hoping he's have to kick himself in the ass.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-21 19:04:25	@robstaboobuzzer oooh, good choice!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-21 21:06:24	@ReneJHerrera yuck. He's getting more f'ed up as the years go by.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-22 00:11:35	@ashes2ashes13 do they all shave their chests? I can't imagine the crap Derrick will get from his cop buddies.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-22 00:14:53	@ashes2ashes13 is that a BB thing or a younger generation thing. Of course here in LA it's an everyday thing...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-22 00:18:12	@ReneJHerrera sorry bro, you're not getting rid of me anytime soon ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-19 02:28:20	Ugh. Listening to a "band" outside my window murdering a Smiths song. Please don't sing it, if you can't do them justice.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-22 17:06:20	Nervousing.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-22 15:11:05	@meehand Seriously. In some ways we've come so far technologically, in others... Not so much.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-24 23:41:41	@BBGossip holy shit, that's Donny? I saw a pic earlier without the beard and I agree, he looks much better!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-25 02:34:58	@truedorktimes did you bow down and praise Community? Love that show.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-26 19:38:23	One of the biggest surprises of #bb16 is how much I like Hayden. He's much more than a goofy pedicab driver. #goodguy
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-26 19:41:15	@OneLonelyCloud Exactly! At first it seemed like they cast a clone. But nothing like David ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-26 19:46:26	@OneLonelyCloud I noticed the same thing. But, yes, very different cast. To me, much better.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-26 19:49:05	@OneLonelyCloud Don't people complain every year? I'd rather have people I like and can root for, rather than the insufferables
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-26 19:54:11	@OneLonelyCloud Funny. But I agree with you. I don't find it boring. Plus the game will change up.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-26 19:26:46	What I really want to know is why Netflix refuses stream The Outsiders?!? Do it for Johnny!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-26 19:49:21	@OneLonelyCloud Lol. Exactly!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-27 00:02:35	@ashes2ashes13 I would think. Maybe the stress gets her.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-28 00:52:17	@MartyCaswell question is, do we worry about Rivers or get excited about Weddle? I know it's early ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-26 00:48:55	@KassMcQ @SU2C @Survivor_Tweet @JeffProbst High praise from Mr. Jeff Probst :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-26 03:56:16	@ashes2ashes13 Wow. Weird timing. Tough times :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-26 21:08:59	@UTgehlken should this be a concern or do you think they'll acclimate?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-27 00:01:17	@ashes2ashes13 does she not drink enough water? It prob gets hot in that backyard...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-30 17:57:40	@BBGossip I don't know how they stay up all night. Reminds me of my 20s... Oh... ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-31 03:05:31	@GirlPakProds it was exciting! And I replied :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-31 04:15:31	@goofygal1171 funny thing is I saw it was out and I thought of you watching the first one. I've never seen...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-31 04:17:41	@ReneJHerrera get a nanny cam ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-31 04:43:19	@ReneJHerrera I was wondering that too. So who's the real Zach?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-31 05:08:37	@ReneJHerrera Ha. Who hasn't other than Caleb recently?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-31 00:56:24	@UTKevinAcee how do you think Keenan will be with the D's keying in on him?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-31 01:22:07	@GirlPakProds good to know. How was your bday?!?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-31 01:24:05	@GirlPakProds Sux about the cold. No. No email :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-31 17:02:14	I might piss off some on here, but you're not a star just cause you played yourself on TV. #sorrynotsorry #stillloveyou
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-31 02:35:43	@GirlPakProds Yeah that's happened before I think. Will check now
36507049	kqueen123	2014-07-31 05:13:14	@ReneJHerrera how'd you guess? Eating a pickle is an impressive feat. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-01 04:47:05	@ashes2ashes13 exactly! I was really impressed with her... And then, uh, not so much. But she did exit with a great attitude.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-01 04:57:36	@BBGossip Yep. Between that and turning down Americas Task, I'm sure production not too happy.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-01 05:03:04	@ashes2ashes13 oh my eyes. Didn't need to see that, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-03 05:14:55	@hamsterwatch seriously? Wow. That can't be good.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-03 05:36:59	@ashes2ashes13 damn. It will def be more boring if Zach leaves.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-03 05:48:12	Celebrating with the birthday girl @GirlPakProds http://t.co/7CNtZGHvrV
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-02 05:42:04	@habesla1 6 tweets! You're rollin' ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-02 06:16:19	@ashes2ashes13 yeah kinda lame. If it's supposed to be shaved, this is nothing.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-04 05:09:13	@ashes2ashes13 wish there was some DR interference :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-01 19:32:06	@ashes2ashes13 problem is her heat stroke issues every time she has to compete.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-02 18:58:08	@ReneJHerrera @stephenfishbach Agree. Enough with all this "stars" business.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-01 22:30:35	@ashes2ashes13 who's Victoria? You mean Veronica, right? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-01 23:30:13	@ashes2ashes13 and how does that make sense at all? Ugh.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-02 20:24:05	@SpencerBGM @TinaWesson Love Tina!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-04 15:19:34	Saw the Giants playing last night and thought it must be an old game. Didn't realize preseason is here. Which only means 1 thing: Football!!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-04 15:32:41	@AndyHerren @robcesternino goal is to get to the end and win the game. If that's accomplished, doesn't matter how you get there.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-04 17:23:22	@daxshepard1 Yay! Love the show and happy you guys get to end it on your terms :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-04 20:51:58	@jodiwincheski I'll take a kiss on the cheek by @Hayden_Moss any day ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-03 20:15:12	@FindMyNervous You have any idea when Sunny in Philly is coming back?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-05 01:32:06	@sbear198 @KassMcQ @hanzikinzz You definitely should've said something! Kass can play nice ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-05 18:12:50	@robstaboobuzzer @JeffProbst yeah that would be a way to garner viewers...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-07 05:55:50	@ashes2ashes13 does he really have no idea? :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-07 05:57:31	@ashes2ashes13 Really?!? I'm trying to catch up. Lol. I'm still an hour behind.  #SaveZach
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-06 02:58:13	@ashes2ashes13 @ronzcakes2 @KraziliaLove #FOOL I suppose you've been called worse...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-05 19:22:56	@daxshepard1 Love the Braverman family!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-07 23:45:47	Already downloaded ;) ‚Äú@Hayden_Moss: I'm FOLLOWING everybody that downloads @DivvieApp and RTs! #ReadySetGo https://t.co/qnfjirs3H1‚Äù
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-07 23:46:46	@Hayden_Moss haha :) You're fast
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-07 23:48:34	@Hayden_Moss That may not be a good thing, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-07 23:55:21	@JulieChen looks like it will be airing at 10pm in LA.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-08 05:17:35	Love watching the last minute #SaveZach campaign. Crazy game.  #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-08 05:45:43	Donny saves himself!!! #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-10 19:41:56	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera I think I helped with that ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-10 19:43:16	@robstaboobuzzer heard it was amazing. Haven't seen it yet.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-12 19:21:28	@ReneJHerrera @Deadline Hmmm. My bet is it won't and it's a negotiation tactic. But I could be wrong...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-11 12:56:32	Back to school for many sad kids across America. What happened to starting after Labor Day? #tooearly
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-14 20:44:34	I'm at the doctor. I've gained weight and shrunk. Wtf? Getting old sucks! Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-15 04:53:16	What happened to Cody's hair? I guess Derrick shouldn't quit his day job. #bb16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-15 15:22:42	@ashes2ashes13 amazing how little booze they've been given this season.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-13 20:00:35	@ReneJHerrera @Hawk_941 @Bhara99 blasphemy!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-18 20:02:44	@ashes2ashes13 How are you holding up today?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-18 20:22:05	@BBGossip Always working the jury vote. But at same time hopefully he's sincere
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-18 22:43:33	@robstaboobuzzer Or you can even do both.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-17 18:56:17	Whenever you don't feel like getting off your ass and working out, do it anyway. It's better. I promise. #nocouchpotato
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-17 00:27:50	@BBGossip @ColetteLala @bigbrothrgossip @bcSharonZ @ashes2ashes13 @bigbrothernet Is it bad that my first reaction was to cringe?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-17 00:28:53	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Hey are we on Thurs for your post bday lunch?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-17 19:33:50	@BBGossip Seriously made me laugh out loud.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-17 20:51:12	@BBGossip uh cause maybe you're trying to get rid of your own.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-19 02:48:42	@ashes2ashes13 I heart Zach so much. Sux he will be leaving :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-18 04:03:36	Why do Christine and Cody get a pass when they say they don't want to go on the block? It's all about attack Zach. Ugh. #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-18 04:14:54	@ashes2ashes13 in all seriousness does Caleb really not like Zach? And if so, why?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-18 04:16:19	@RHAPfan21 Lol. They have no idea how misleading the actual show is.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-18 04:32:53	Yay Donny! Even though this will hurt Zach's game I love that you foiled their plans. And I hate when people throw challenges. #bb16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-18 04:36:20	@BBGossip I wish they would show that stuff. Makes it so much more interesting.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-17 06:08:03	Why is it every time Facebook makes a change everyone thinks they are trying to invade their privacy? There are privacy controls. Use them.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-17 06:08:57	@ashes2ashes13 Yuck. Always Zach. Why is he such a target? Scapegoat?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-17 06:52:11	@ashes2ashes13 @08Jayhawk This is the Frankie I thought we'd see in the beginning. He seems to have gotten worse with every passing day.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-19 19:52:59	@BBGossip that's her biggest move all season.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-19 20:04:59	Victoria is so out of her element. No clue. #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-19 19:16:13	@BBGossip I assume that's why she was allowed to do it.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-20 22:57:24	@ashes2ashes13 #BB16 is an exercise in group think.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-20 01:34:00	@RealitySeth @robstaboobuzzer Huntner? smh
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-21 03:23:27	I don't understand why #BB16 isn't edited how things actually went down. They were gunning for Zach all week. So show that!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-20 05:51:53	@RHAPfan21 almost an old timer.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-22 15:19:51	@ashes2ashes13 I think it's safe to say Cody will Never be called back. #projection
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-22 15:22:28	@realityblurred and got a new haircut ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-20 15:43:24	@ashes2ashes13 he's even hurting Devin's daughter.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-22 15:30:08	@goofygal1171 When u got back and saw clients right away, how'd u explain your appearance? You couldn't tell them where you were yet, right?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-20 19:23:46	@ReneJHerrera @mrsredsox0923 obsessed is the key word ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-22 19:34:06	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer @TabooBuzzer LMFAO
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-22 04:51:10	Victoria is so proud if herself for festering the hat. Maybe she should put that much effort into playing the game. #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-22 05:16:10	@salomey5 Exactly. I don't really get the negativity from some regarding it.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-22 05:16:49	@AndyHerren @BBGossip LMFAO!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-22 05:21:03	@JeffProbst Haha. Yes. Social media really highlights a idiotic side of humanity.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-22 05:27:53	@KassMcQ @JeffProbst @robcesternino Looks like they'll implement rules what contestants can and cannot say/interact on social media.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-22 05:31:39	@ashes2ashes13 ugh. No reason to watch feeds for you this week. Unless they actually get smart and take out Frankie.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-22 05:46:22	@KassMcQ @JeffProbst @robcesternino Definitely rethink. Social media can add to the show and experience. So as you imply #adapt
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-24 22:26:00	@ReneJHerrera @NatalieHorny @robstaboobuzzer Lol. Love the extra effort. Top that buzzer  :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-24 22:29:19	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera @NatalieHorny Hmmm. I'm sure there are plenty of peeps you can think of. @mrsredsox0923 is one choice ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-24 22:47:19	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera @robcesternino @NicoleLuvsShoes @theabimaria @ColtonCumbie Edit? No editing. Straight shot! ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-24 22:49:00	@robstaboobuzzer Ok. Good for you for getting it done :) Why didn't you go to DC?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-25 03:57:43	I know she's just a kid basically, but it's painful anytime I have to watch Victoria. #fishoutofwater #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-25 03:59:35	@ashes2ashes13 just like the only reason they voted out Zach was cause he didn't volunteer to go on the block
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-25 04:42:09	@GirlPakProds Have you checked your Facebook today? Don't throw rocks at me. #DucksHead ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-23 06:11:41	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Aha your Halloween costume. Or you can be the Drunk Jellyfish Passing Kidney Stones. Pepper spray is fun.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-23 23:45:26	@BBGossip @SpiritsAngels pretty sure she could've been hooked up to an IV in the amount of time she was gone.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-24 00:13:22	@ashes2ashes13 @BBGossip My guess is people let their personal feelings for the houseguest cloud their perception. Not based on any facts
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-25 06:12:32	@darrenhabermft @habesla1 How'd you do that? Haven't you only been on twitter for a minute?!?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-24 01:33:20	@BBGossip @SpiritsAngels @SheSaidNo467 You do realize people have diff medical experiences, right? Let it go...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-24 01:33:52	@ashes2ashes13 gross
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-25 20:11:52	@GetOnSurvivor @robstaboobuzzer Was it awesome?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-24 03:09:05	@RHAPfan21 the first couple of weeks we thought it has promise.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-25 21:06:11	@GetOnSurvivor @robstaboobuzzer hmmm. Food for thought :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-23 16:43:37	@robstaboobuzzer @robcesternino it all depends on how it's regulated. Basically all or nothing or ???
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-23 16:50:59	@robstaboobuzzer @robcesternino Btw, wtf is enstarz? They just picked up Probst tweet and a former quote. Would love to know specifics.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-26 00:02:38	@L_Ho_2012 Love that show. :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-26 03:47:10	@GirlPakProds That's cool. You don't have to do a video. You're not obligated to do anything. Nice of you to give $ to her grandfather tho
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-26 04:41:48	@ReneJHerrera I never watch. But sounds like Breaking Bad kicked ass. Happy about that.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-26 23:43:45	@ReneJHerrera gotta get your workout on
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-26 15:24:21	@ReneJHerrera @nofate1991 @robstaboobuzzer I did too and still haven't gotten a response from my brother. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-26 15:26:57	@robstaboobuzzer it's ok if he doesn't do the challenge, but at least acknowledge. Just means I have to kick his ass ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-27 16:26:10	@truedorktimes Damn. No wonder I didn't get a call back. Pfft. Next occupation: Gladiator
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-27 16:27:28	@KassMcQ @SpencerBGM Ahhhh, memories...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-27 16:24:11	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds Cast is out. #Survivor starts 9/24. 18 players. (1 team had to drop out last min.) When shall we draft?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-27 17:22:14	@ReneJHerrera @alliepohevitz My guess: Kass, Tony and Spencer...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-27 17:35:31	@ReneJHerrera @alliepohevitz Yeah the tweeting can be fun. If someone is afraid of being spoiled by the context they don't have to follow
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-27 17:36:52	@ReneJHerrera @alliepohevitz But I can see where producers would be freaked. Hopefully it's not all or nothing...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-27 18:25:56	@robstaboobuzzer I reserve judgement about all of the cast til I watch. Plus, I ding even know who the guy is, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-26 17:06:44	@ReneJHerrera @RHAPfan21 @robstaboobuzzer You expect us to believe you REN?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-26 17:17:05	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera @RHAPfan21 Has he taken down the fake profile yet? Lol. #GoodGuys #Buzz and #REN
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-26 18:25:30	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds LOL...HIS sources. But that is the rumor. I'm thinking maybe I won't poo poo snake draft this time. #survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-26 18:30:00	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds sounds good to me ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-26 19:21:18	@UTgehlken Wow. Never thought I'd be worried that Geathers is out. But I am...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-28 23:24:33	@ReneJHerrera you smelt it, you...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-26 20:49:05	@mrsredsox0923 @L_Ho_2012 Perfect bed mate :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-29 05:19:10	#BBOverwhelmingNo LMFAO!!! Sorry, not sorry.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-28 19:51:40	@RHAPfan21 why so down?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-26 23:50:08	@ReneJHerrera once you get started it gets easier ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-26 23:51:01	@nofate1991 @ReneJHerrera No arguing there. I'm not sure why Rene hasn't sent me some!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-28 22:50:35	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds oh D, too far...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-29 05:41:39	Love your sincerity and you're heart Donny. Fairly rare on a reality show. #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-29 06:00:45	@ColtonCumbie yes they are. Thinking of you.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-28 20:17:41	@nofate1991 @Survivor_Tweet @JeffProbst @ReneJHerrera How did you get Jeff to block you?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-28 20:21:44	@nofate1991 @Survivor_Tweet @JeffProbst @ReneJHerrera That is weird :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-29 19:15:41	@RHAPfan21 uh. Yes it would be.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-30 00:42:40	@ashes2ashes13 Ha. Tell that to Zach.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-30 00:45:06	@nofate1991 did it work?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-30 03:23:15	@RHAPfan21 will u be watching?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-31 01:57:01	@ashes2ashes13 What did he say that everyone is reacting to?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-31 02:08:20	@ashes2ashes13 he really is a classy guy. Ugh.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-08-31 18:57:00	Draft day today. Am I prepared? Not really. But I did keep #1 pick Charles. And it does mean real football starts soon! #chargers #nfl
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-01 19:00:47	@MartyCaswell route running is the key. Brown seemed to have trouble with that.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-02 01:43:06	@robcesternino @lifetimetv omg. You're serious. I thought you were just having flashbacks or something. #screech
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-01 21:13:57	@GetOnSurvivor @Hawk_941 I'm considering it ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-03 18:49:08	@KassMcQ @SpencerBGM Spencer's motto: When in doubt, blame Kass.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-04 00:29:13	@dexterleekim that's the last time I listen to your posts :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-04 02:09:24	@FindMyNervous how are you not freaking out?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-03 02:27:25	Seriously, how is Cutter still alive in the competition? #masterchef
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-03 04:51:31	So excited! Flight of the Concords will be back for a 4 episode encore. Love me some Bret.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-04 03:54:27	@ReneJHerrera how long did it take you to get into it?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-03 20:32:26	@dexterleekim so what was the dumb article then?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-05 05:27:54	@ashes2ashes13 what were the boos about? It's not like she talked about taking V virginity. But seriously, any ideas?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-05 05:42:05	@RHAPfan21 @BBCandice she's far from the worst houseguest, so yes, I was surprised.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-05 00:38:17	#BB16 media mogul's sister meets #NFL. Ariana Grande singing opening nights national anthem.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-05 19:29:15	@truedorktimes why sad?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-05 19:29:38	@truedorktimes aha. Got it ;(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-05 22:31:52	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim FYI, Survivor preview on TVGN Mon.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-06 00:16:01	@teetomterrific feel better soon :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-07 21:44:35	Patience... is what's required from me on the 1st weekend of football. #Chargers don't play til tomorrow. Saved the best for last. #GoBolts
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-08 22:44:28	Unicycles do not look fun.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-08 00:28:07	@ashes2ashes13 no Utopia for you?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-08 00:28:30	@teetomterrific let me know if I should watch. Thinking of it...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-08 00:31:59	@ashes2ashes13 Yeah I hear ya. Surprised you haven't given up. It's the first time I don't even care to watch the regular shows.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-08 00:32:14	@teetomterrific is that good or bad? Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-09 02:36:24	@Chargers touched the ground. Incomplete.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-08 03:49:16	@KassMcQ Lol. How is Utopia? Worth checking out?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-08 03:59:49	@KassMcQ Damn. If you're happy to see Frankie, that's telling. Lol. Got both recording and not watching either at the moment.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-09 03:37:52	@UTKevinAcee was mad at Wright. But love his effort the next couple of plays.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-09 04:02:37	@UTgehlken maybe they should target Green and not Royal. He's off his game tonight.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-09 18:02:40	@robstaboobuzzer @mrsredsox0923 Pfft. I come to you for the news Buzzer!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-09 18:12:16	@robstaboobuzzer competing with the other large screen phones?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-09 19:03:46	@robstaboobuzzer can't connect :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-09 19:12:21	@robstaboobuzzer I don't think it's available in US iTunes stores yet
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-09 19:20:21	@robstaboobuzzer Yay. Downloading right now :) #U2 #Apple
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-09 21:06:46	@UTKevinAcee what's your take on it?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-10 19:42:01	@KassMcQ I just watched the BB16 episode. Call me a sap, but it was a heartwarming moment. :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-09 21:09:03	@DaltonRoss I have conflicts with recording. Which one should I choose?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-09 16:10:53	@UTKevinAcee @RooneyRuleBlues The worst part about being a Charger fan is the other fans. Blah.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-09 16:17:32	@RooneyRuleBlues @UTKevinAcee No satisfaction with mediocrity. There may just be other solutions than reactionary "tear it down..."
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-09 16:51:39	@RooneyRuleBlues @UTKevinAcee Yeah. I hear ya. It will be a test this year for the coaches.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-08 18:27:19	@UTKevinAcee @Ravens Easier to justify or rationalize his actions before. But agree... It was terrible to begin with.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-10 02:58:01	@BBGossip I can't record both BB and Utopia tonight. Which should I choose?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-08 19:50:19	@mattandtodd @goofygal1171 Yay. Will this be more unfiltered talk Denise?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-08 20:01:24	@goofygal1171 @mattandtodd Hehe. I'm right there with ya ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-11 03:46:51	@ChadKincaid1 why can't you do both?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-11 04:24:02	@ashes2ashes13 reveal what? This is the time. Ugh.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-11 04:28:54	@MartyCaswell Are we really surprised about Goodell? Terrible. He needs to go.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-11 04:31:12	@MartyCaswell Cycle of violence. Much psychology behind it... The patterns are very similar even though each case may be individual.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-11 04:33:13	Best part of tonight's episode was Cody's face when he learned he had to wear the dinosaur suit again. Lol. #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-11 18:30:15	@JulieChen I would've freaked out!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-11 19:50:46	@ashes2ashes13 you know the season has gone to shit when they have to bring in the jurors who we'd rather watch.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-11 19:54:52	@SpencerBGM @KassMcQ It's nice to see your relationship is still going strong.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-12 19:58:14	@BBGossip Wait! Julie doesn't write her own tweets?!? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-14 22:24:16	Seriously D, get your heads out of your asses.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-14 23:38:26	Awesome win #Chargers! And good job D stepping up in the 4th!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-15 00:38:11	@robcesternino sorry bro. My #chargers won so I can enjoy the week.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-14 01:39:49	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim @robcesternino did you watch the tvgn preview? I assume #RHAP is more informative?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-15 21:03:11	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera ok. Now this is getting creepy.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-13 18:19:15	@goofygal1171 Skimmed through this &amp; caught the part about Syd, the F word and playdough at 4. Lmao Interesting to hear your approach w/her.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-16 21:24:38	@mrsredsox0923 Happy Birthday!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-16 02:45:33	@realityblurred seriously seeking attention.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-14 20:38:11	@UTgehlken what's the point of New York reviewing if they are worse than the officials on the field? Disgusted.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-18 02:31:37	What's the point of hyping who wins the veto and if it's used when you show who's sitting in the eviction seats the entire show? Fail #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-18 04:04:20	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera How far have you gotten? This shouldn't take as long as fantasy football ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-18 04:06:59	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera who will be last pick? Hmmm. Now you're getting into the scrubs.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-18 04:09:29	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Lol. Josh? Why do you hate him so much? What about Jaclyn?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-18 04:11:01	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera a little Frankie Grande like?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-18 04:13:11	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera who was first pick? Did REN pick Rocker?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-18 18:09:36	@UTKevinAcee but who keeps talking about it? Chargers have moved on.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-18 18:12:16	@truedorktimes @JeffProbst wasn't it just part of the tvgn preview?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-18 18:13:44	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Buzzer + REN in NY = Scary
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-18 18:14:04	@truedorktimes @JeffProbst oh cool. Good to know :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-18 18:23:34	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera They change locations for finale or would it be for another NoPrisoners venture?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-19 22:59:36	@ReneJHerrera who's on your survivor team?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-20 00:05:13	@ReneJHerrera 2 cute girls and a douche
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-20 00:12:28	@FindMyNervous I've done it. Will see what happens.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-20 00:13:40	@FindMyNervous you can turn off predictive typing
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-20 02:05:15	Ugh. Anyway to keep Twitter from showing other people's favorites in my timeline? If they wanted to share it, they would've retweeted!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-17 23:18:46	@mrsredsox0923 @robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera @danacomiskey @Hawk_941 @RHAPfan21 who has first pick?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-17 23:22:46	@robstaboobuzzer would you really reveal that beforehand?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-17 23:28:43	@robstaboobuzzer Ha. I still understood. And good to be safe!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-20 21:25:14	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim When do we start drafting? I forgot.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-20 15:48:59	@mrsredsox0923 @robstaboobuzzer Ah yes. Teenagers. Isn't that their job? I don't envy you.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-20 16:15:36	@robstaboobuzzer @Hawk_941 its that imposter. Did he ever take down the account btw?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-20 16:20:12	@Hawk_941 @robstaboobuzzer you missed out on the fake account Hawk? It is still there, but the posts were short lived.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-20 16:20:45	@robstaboobuzzer @RHAPfan21 @Hawk_941 I know. It's enabling by even bringing it up.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-20 16:21:45	@Hawk_941 @ReneJHerrera @nofate1991 @robstaboobuzzer @KatEdorsson some things are better kept to ones self. Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-20 16:22:38	@robstaboobuzzer @RHAPfan21 @Hawk_941 You and Frankie can hang out. Ick.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-20 22:10:54	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds we have to get on the stick!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-21 20:22:50	Great win #Chargers! On the road, with key guys out. You got it done!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-22 17:21:57	@robstaboobuzzer Yep you can fully turn off or minimize
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-22 17:23:43	@realityblurred are all these posts set up to have to do a survey to read further?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-22 19:05:14	Love you Trader Joes, but not selling sunblock cause it's no longer "summer" is a fail. Sunburns happen year around.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-22 20:29:55	@robstaboobuzzer that must be a complimfbr
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-22 21:29:57	@KassMcQ Hey Kass! You have any particular favorites you're rooting for this upcoming season? Or will you wait til episode one?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-22 05:58:56	@Keenan13Allen Yep. Team player cares more about the wins than personal stats! :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-23 15:20:16	Finished our #Survivor draft. Number one pick went to me. Go @ValCollins_
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 01:52:52	@FindMyNervous Libra here.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 03:03:51	@daxshepard1 I love you Bravermans!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 03:05:56	@alliepohevitz Allie, hope you had a great vacation! Do you know when casting starts up again? I see the app has been open all year...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 04:17:02	Will tomorrows #BB16 finale be the most anticlimactic yet?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 04:19:25	#Survivor premiere tomorrow! May tribe #Abigarrado be the sole survibor. @GirlPakProds @dexterleekim
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 04:21:11	@ChrisTaylor8859 I'm hoping for either Zach or Donny for AFP. I can't imagine Derrick not winning. At least he's earned it though!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 04:21:59	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I can't favorite your tweet #MonoGordo
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 04:29:02	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds shaking in my boots.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 21:59:50	@KassMcQ Kass will you be watching east coast time or west coast? What do you think it will be like now that you've played?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 22:11:33	@salomey5 I still don't believe it. Or at least I hope it's not true.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-22 20:30:56	@robstaboobuzzer lol. Compliment.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-22 20:31:57	@robstaboobuzzer just read some of his tweets. Doesn't seem like he's changed a bit.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 23:09:13	@teetomterrific for you yes. I still have 4 hours!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 23:10:31	@teetomterrific the cold hearted truth!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 23:11:35	@robstaboobuzzer east coast bias. Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-22 22:48:48	@robstaboobuzzer hey do you where it shows how many tweets you've tweeted on the new app?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 02:07:25	@NatalieeAnd @robstaboobuzzer not even to say hi? That sux :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 03:01:02	Finally #Survivor!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 03:08:49	You're about as mentally strong as that rock. Keith says to son Wes. Lol. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 03:23:46	Wow emotional decisions right away. And my pick @ValCollins_ may have a rough road ahead being sent to exile. But she's tough. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 03:24:33	@alliepohevitz definitely my favorites
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 03:36:55	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim How is it that the first 2 people sent to exile were from my tribe?!?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 03:38:51	@realityblurred I didn't interpret it that way at all. I wonder how @ValCollins_ felt.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 03:46:58	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim hahahaha. They do have that going for them.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-23 15:22:52	@goofygal1171 @Survivor_Tweet Now you can just enjoy the show. I'm afraid to miss to much by live tweeting ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 04:14:41	@mikeskupin you hard on the newbies Skupin?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 04:26:55	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim and voted out first! Who was the Baylor vote?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 04:28:32	@mikeskupin She already outted herself. Doubt he would've said anything if she hadn't.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 04:32:33	@mrsredsox0923 Yep. That's what happens with recruits. (Of course I assume it's a recruit)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 04:42:46	Happy with who won #BB16 and AFP. Realize I can wait til tomorrow to watch. It hasn't been must see TV for weeks.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 04:44:14	@RHAPfan21 fortunately you have 9 months off.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 04:45:34	@Glynis_in_WA @hamsterwatch omg. He's shocked he's not loved by everyone.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 04:47:48	@JohnMCochran @JeffProbst You know the rules. Stay off social media until you've watched ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 04:55:47	@KassMcQ why so blurry in between?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 18:10:35	@ashes2ashes13 is Zach tweeting yet?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 18:28:34	Why is Frankie on The Talk? He wasn't in the top 4 nor top 3 of America's Favorite Player? #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 20:24:01	Love Zach's reaction to Donny winning America's Favorite Player. Great sport. #BB16
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 16:25:55	This #Survivor Twitter ban sucks :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 16:56:47	@parvatishallow @drdrew @CBSNews I guess this is why you're too busy to do SurvivorLive? Congrats Parvati.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 17:25:55	@Derrick_L13 you played a flawless game! Well deserved. Congrats!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 22:29:37	@ReneJHerrera Oh Rene. I'm so sorry. My heart goes out to you. Love the pic. Such a cutie.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 22:48:07	@joshuacanfield Looks like a fun season. I'm rooting for you and @thereedkelly!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-25 22:50:29	@ValCollins_ Was so happy to see you survive the wrath of exile island!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-26 00:24:27	@sophieGclarke @joshuacanfield @thereedkelly Love them. And love Jeremy and Val.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-26 00:26:07	@sophieGclarke you're not the 1st to question that. Did it bother you? For some reason I wasn't offended.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-26 00:34:24	@mikeskupin I think one of the twinnies said it first.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-26 00:37:35	@mikeskupin I hear ya. I'm harder on newbie recruits too :) #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-26 00:38:56	@BBGossip not disagreeing, but how do you think he played us?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-26 00:43:12	@BBGossip Yeah the diary rooms were full of bs quite a bit. From Frankie too.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-26 16:30:41	@ranceypants Yay!!! So fun watching you this season!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-26 16:31:23	@robstaboobuzzer people were offended by that.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-26 16:32:30	@ashes2ashes13 we're just so excited!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-26 16:33:14	@zach622 @robstaboobuzzer I actually thought it was funny.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-26 16:36:41	@thereedkelly Sunday football :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-26 16:39:07	@thereedkelly San Diego Chargers. Lifelong fan :) You watch?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-27 20:57:00	@Lyndzzz What time is there? It's Saturday afternoon here.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-26 05:24:40	@SurvivorPenner A Caucasian man went first last time, right? Would be interesting to profile all the first boots.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-27 05:48:18	@RHAPfan21 now he just needs to join Twitter.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 15:14:33	@truedorktimes Woah. You mean someone other than Rocker is on the show?!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 15:16:17	@goofygal1171 @bmstapley Awesome! Happy birthday Brad! Being dead does sorta suck ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 17:59:37	@farmguy69 @RHAPfan21 Uh oh. Are there clear guidelines? Drama before the game? Here we go... ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 18:02:08	@ashes2ashes13 @FindMyNervous thanks for all your coverage and no sleep this season!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 18:09:19	@robstaboobuzzer @JeffProbst I'm ready too! Let's go!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 18:09:58	@JeffProbst east coast or west coast Jeff? Or both?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 18:54:17	@robstaboobuzzer how come everyone is blocking you lately?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-24 19:34:12	Didn't realize how much I've missed #Survivor and how much I want to play until today when it's finally back! So excited!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-29 02:01:07	@goofygal1171 have you always watched TAR? I've never seen a full episode.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-28 16:02:34	@BBGossip thanks for all your work!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-28 16:06:34	@RHAPfan21 unless the girlfriend set it up?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-28 16:10:07	@bekkieg @RHAPfan21 damn. I think she's right about the card. Unless he used the back of it. Find the same image and you will know.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-29 19:12:47	@JeffProbst so you're saying you like over the top and not believable? He prob is interesting, but you don't think it's forced?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-30 16:16:27	@JeffProbst Sounds good Jeff. Is there a deadline?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-30 17:08:38	@truedorktimes it's actually been open all year.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-30 17:44:27	@truedorktimes yeah I think in a couple of weeks probably.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-30 02:39:18	@DjFluker76 I 100% agree with you!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-30 04:14:21	@FindMyNervous Lol. But seriously every update I do kills the battery. I have to drain it, reset network settings etc to fix.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-01 03:52:11	@FindMyNervous has he added anything to Instagram? Seems fans are flummoxed he's not tweeting more.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-01 03:58:34	@FindMyNervous Lol. I just checked out replies. I think he has the preteen market down.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-01 04:07:36	@KassMcQ @ChannonSarah Yep. This topic is so pervasive and ingrained. Would be interesting how other female survivors view this.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-01 01:48:44	@JeffProbst When does casting start watching the vids? Is there a deadline? Need to know if I have time to get their attention!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-01 01:50:40	@JeffProbst East coast bias again :( Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-01 03:27:52	@ReneJHerrera @FindMyNervous I'm worse than you Ash. I don't even understand the point of snapchat.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-28 20:38:57	Again Chargers D makes a 0-3 Jags look like the Broncos. Seriously f'ing frustrating.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-28 21:55:02	@ReneJHerrera great question. I think fans are annoyed with 1st half. Also there were 6000 seats available.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-28 21:59:54	@ReneJHerrera not I ;) But definitely some fair weathered fans.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-28 22:02:52	@nofate1991 @ReneJHerrera It's the Norv Turner effect. Fans don't trust them yet.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-28 22:03:08	@nofate1991 @ReneJHerrera I'll be there next week though!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-28 22:08:46	@ReneJHerrera @nofate1991 yeah the argument is there is a lot more to do year round in SD. But I would rather they always be sold out.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-28 22:21:53	@UTgehlken great effort. Will be ruled non catch I fear.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-28 23:02:57	Ok #Chargers, great second half adjustments! Thank you for not being the old team that loses to bad teams.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-29 00:24:08	@RHAPfan21 that's cause they let go of the guy who composed the music for years. That's why I suspect they don't do the intros anymore.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-29 04:12:17	@ashes2ashes13 it's really bizarre. She's obsessed.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-02 03:17:19	Love it! Julie sends John to exile island! (A girl) #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-02 03:23:21	No easy bargaining on #Survivor with @JeffProbst running the show. Lesson: don't lose your flint.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-02 03:37:53	Gut wrenching hurting your child even if it is just a game. Clearly Missy backed down. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-02 03:58:18	Bummer. Val got caught up in a web of lives :( #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-02 03:59:16	@ARTIS_Survivor yeah. Way too suspicious.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-02 04:01:46	@ReneJHerrera please tell me you're kidding.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-02 04:04:11	@ReneJHerrera have you read his tweets? I wonder if it's for show...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-02 04:09:50	@ReneJHerrera @ranceypants read all the responses to his tweets. Fan girls/boys LOVE him...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-02 04:13:45	@joshuacanfield not sure about your reasoning for voting for Baylor last ep, but love that you're observant and thinking about the gamr
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-02 04:25:08	@ValCollins_ Sorry to see you go so early :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-02 04:28:15	@ReneJHerrera sicko. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-01 19:32:19	@hamsterwatch @EvelDick fortunately it's not the death sentence it used to be. Still scary tho I'm sure.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-09-29 19:07:33	@JeffProbst @TimBoucher33 have to keep asking that! It's the best!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-03 00:45:06	@RHAPfan21 @DonnyThompsonBB This is for sure legit?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-03 00:46:55	@DonnyThompsonBB this is really you Donny? So happy you're on Twitter. Been waiting ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-03 01:16:54	@ranceypants As much as we love you for your entertainment, we also love you for you. Your love for your family. Your compassion. Stay you.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-02 16:19:00	Ha @JeffProbst says to @DaltonRoss that he hasn't been as wrong about his predictions w Val in a long time. What about Spencer? #shortmemory
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-03 20:31:30	@DonnyThompson It's photoshopped! Lol. Love that you're on here Donny!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-04 02:51:01	@joshuacanfield @thereedkelly let us know how you feel tomorrow.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-04 03:47:12	@jodiwincheski Ha. Have a great birthday!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-04 19:33:17	@joshuacanfield Yuck. Unfortunately social media brings out the idiots who wouldn't say it to your face.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-05 22:30:57	Who said #Chargers can't run? Brandon Oliver!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-05 23:08:55	@MartyCaswell wtf. Is this even real,
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-05 23:10:05	@UTgehlken do you know what happened? I'm in the stadium where we get no news.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-06 20:37:49	@Chargers I don't think I've ever seen anything like this.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-07 02:34:55	@Lyndzzz @mikeskupin makes me hungry and I just ate!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-07 20:28:43	@GirlPakProds Ahhh. We miss you Deb!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-07 21:23:42	@GirlPakProds fancy!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-08 05:38:40	@RHAPfan21 who's going that you wanted to see?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-08 06:18:28	@RHAPfan21 where do you live?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-08 06:40:17	@RHAPfan21 just a weekend trip ;) Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-08 17:16:24	@KassMcQ you're going this year? Awesome!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-08 17:48:56	@KassMcQ definitely a good cause that has impacted many.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-08 18:52:43	@FindMyNervous @ReneJHerrera Makes sense. Normal that it stays with you. Anniversaries can be tough. Thinking of you.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-09 03:39:24	@ARTIS_Survivor So would I! I gotta get cast ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-09 03:39:53	@ReneJHerrera still one of the most hilarious moments.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-09 03:41:06	@SurvivorOz Jaclyn = purple Kelly?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-08 21:00:13	@robstaboobuzzer Their name is Chargers?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-09 03:56:16	Not sure if it's a good idea to get rid of muscle when you're tribe can't win, but happy to see Rocker voted out. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-09 03:58:46	@Softball2411 good point
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-09 04:03:19	@ReneJHerrera who else has promoted applying? I was wondering too.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-09 04:05:47	@ReneJHerrera Kass did too.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-08 23:35:58	@KassMcQ seriously?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-09 17:03:36	@GetOnSurvivor @SpencerBGM interesting the push to have former players tweet about applying.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-09 20:46:03	@joshuacanfield sounds like an awesome day! ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-11 04:44:07	@jeremy2collins before it gets soggy. But not too crispy. How long is that?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-12 22:03:40	#Chargers are killing themselves. Seriously, stop playing down to your competition. #baddecisions #poorexecution
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-12 23:40:39	Phew. Always good to beat the Raiders. A win is a win. #Chargers
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-14 19:53:29	Just listening to #RHAP and found out @robcesternino and I have the same birthday! #libra
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-15 17:09:37	@robstaboobuzzer that's how I used to feel about Twitter. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-17 05:21:25	@FindMyNervous donate $10 and Zach will follow you. And then you can scream like a preteen fan girl ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-15 23:00:10	@parvatishallow depends what time you are watching. East coast or west?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-18 05:46:08	@FindMyNervous @RenegadesMel @crackmyribsopen Happy Birthday! Another Libra!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-16 03:33:00	Wait. Why is Alec so pissy? Cause his dad made him get up and do the chores? Keep that at home. This is #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-16 03:53:09	"I'm honestly so confused what name I'm supposed to be writing down right now." Eek. Not where you want to be at tribal. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-16 03:56:22	LMAO at Drew, the kingpin of throwing challenges being voted out tonight! #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-16 03:59:06	@salomey5 I think a lot of people did. Hilarious.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-16 04:03:09	@salomey5 Haha. Yeah I'm sure we did miss out on the smh moments, but this was too perfect.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-16 04:03:48	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds How is it that Deb's tribe is still fully intact?!?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-16 04:06:11	@thereedkelly enjoy. It is hilarious.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-17 23:20:24	@mrsredsox0923 @KenKaminesky is this real?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-17 23:21:36	@mrsredsox0923 @KenKaminesky I think it's a hosx
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-16 15:06:55	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim yes! D's tribe has lost 2 in a row. You're sitting pretty ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-19 23:25:01	Tough loss against a divisional opponent. Regroup and get ready to play your best game this Thursday. #Chargers
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-20 00:44:33	@MartyCaswell that and penalties.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-16 20:43:44	@truedorktimes yeah I really don't get it.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-16 20:48:15	@truedorktimes True cause they aren't on Netflix either. But all of it adds up quickly.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-20 02:41:33	Omg. The last scene of The Walking Dead!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-22 19:13:34	@GirlPakProds Welcome back!!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-22 19:15:24	@ValCollins_ Seriously? Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-22 19:47:55	@ReneJHerrera @RHAPfan21 how would you know if you like the season if you don't watch? Get on the stick! ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-22 21:55:28	@GirlPakProds you better catch up ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-22 21:57:28	@GirlPakProds haha. @dexterleekim and I are rooting for one your players to go home tonight! üòõ
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-23 03:57:26	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Not even Vegas would've bet on these odds. Mathematically impossible! Ugh.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-23 04:02:47	@goofygal1171 What?!? She broke her nose? Poor kid.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-23 04:03:40	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I think we need to inspect the books. Seems like some insider trading may have happened ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-23 04:05:04	@SurvivorPenner I hope there's a big penalty. Otherwise, what's to stop any tribe from overeating?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-23 04:10:27	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Hahaha. And Morgan from last season.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-21 02:46:39	@ReneJHerrera Thanks brother! :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-24 17:13:13	@RHAPfan21 identity crisis?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-24 17:20:32	@RHAPfan21 hmmm. Maybe a good thing?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-28 16:59:52	@FindMyNervous just start doing it!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-30 03:20:41	Interesting choice by Natalie volunteering to go to exile after Reed already picked Julie. Strategy? #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-30 03:21:16	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Eh. We've already predicted you'll walk away unscathed tonight.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-30 03:30:11	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim not looking good for me.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-30 03:31:38	Who else is a meat collector? #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-30 03:36:22	@ReneJHerrera Lmfao!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-30 03:55:57	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Finally! Dex and I are celebrating tonight! Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-30 04:04:15	@KassMcQ no bailouts for you guys, huh? Even after rice-gate...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-30 03:11:41	@JeffProbst Agree. But was precedent does that set for future seasons?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-30 03:23:09	@ARTIS_Survivor @JeffProbst Agree. Penalty has to be big enough to dissuade future players from doing it.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-30 17:42:24	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim when do we get to see you? Lunch...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-01 21:02:43	@jerrimanthey done. Waiting for verification email.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-31 03:16:46	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim sounds goof
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-31 03:17:03	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim oops. I meant good.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-02 05:12:45	@RHAPfan21 why are you trying to unfollow?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-02 05:14:42	@RHAPfan21 there's a follow limit? Crazy.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-10-31 18:48:55	@robstaboobuzzer Does that mean you don't like it? Would you ever not watch?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-02 18:39:37	It's official. Whatever mojo #Chargers had in the beginning of the season is gone. Terrible.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-02 19:09:45	@UTKevinAcee unfortunately it's starting to remind me of the Norv years. I had hoped McCoy was different. Not so sure now.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-02 19:45:25	@UTgehlken do you have any idea why they have gotten so bad?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-02 19:57:58	@robstaboobuzzer tell me about it. Totally ridiculous. Not the same team as earlier in the season.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-02 20:05:00	@TBMWolverine shit.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-02 20:22:01	@dexterleekim @Chargers I think this means DH Kim is sickened.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-02 20:24:09	@UTKevinAcee what has happened to Fluker?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-02 22:21:09	@jerrimanthey I've tried a couple of times and never gotten the verification email. Not in spam either :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-04 20:07:57	@truedorktimes what is it normally?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-04 20:08:48	@ReneJHerrera @truedorktimes that sux :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-04 05:19:46	@RHAPfan21 I had Zach on Twitter but unfollowed him. It was a bit insufferable.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-03 17:30:37	@jerrimanthey Just went through this time. I did it on the desktop rather than the phone. Maybe that was the difference.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-05 02:35:40	@goofygal1171 Had a good day at work today. Helped me take my mind off of other things ;) #therapyrocks
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-05 03:49:06	wait, what did I miss?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-05 03:51:13	@teetomterrific which people?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-05 03:56:08	@teetomterrific oh yeah. Like half the country ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-06 04:11:12	Lol "I could care less about Missy and Baylor." Spit. -Keith #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-06 04:23:40	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim big influencer
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-06 04:32:58	Rule #1 in #Survivor: Don't steal the trail mix. #goodreasontovoteyouout
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-06 04:33:33	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim haha. Just don't steal my trail mix.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-06 04:40:42	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim a member of my tribe actually won immunity!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-06 04:46:46	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim ha. I can see that.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-06 04:56:45	Ugh. Shaking my head. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-06 04:57:15	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim or Valentines! Snnoyed
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-06 05:00:39	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim seriously the worst luck ever.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-06 05:11:43	@robstaboobuzzer @ARTIS_Survivor didn't that all happen in the same day? Things may have changed a day or two layer
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-05 07:21:21	@jerrimanthey Oh wow. The number jumped up a lot today! :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-07 05:07:11	@GirlPakProds well sleep does depreciate over time, right? Ugh
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-08 05:28:33	@ValCollins_ @jeremy2collins @jeremy_val Happy birthday!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-06 15:43:02	@eorlins you're watching again?!?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-06 19:39:25	@Chargers Weddle!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-06 19:54:29	@JeffProbst Jeff, curious if your perspective on quitters has changed over the seasons? Is it more accepting or ?? #noshade #trulycurious
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-06 19:54:52	@gordonholmes @Survivor_Tweet wait what?!?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-08 16:21:23	@KassMcQ Happy birthday! Have a great weekend.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-06 21:54:58	@UTgehlken woohoo!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-08 16:59:27	@robstaboobuzzer another event or ??
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-08 17:25:44	@robstaboobuzzer Have fun! Eat some good pizza!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-08 19:16:22	@kclark168 you're wrong. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-08 19:18:37	@kclark168 about everyone being right and justified from their own pov. It was a joke ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-08 19:30:06	@kclark168 did you see my text and responding here?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-08 22:09:54	@robstaboobuzzer that's it?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-10 00:26:19	@ChadKincaid1 :( Sorry Chad
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-10 00:28:49	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Wish the finale was on a Sunday. I miss my bros :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-10 02:10:18	@ChadKincaid1 Ouch. Sorry. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-10 20:46:37	@GetOnSurvivor @SpencerBGM how was S30 cast before?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-10 21:03:18	@GetOnSurvivor @SpencerBGM Ok. I read your blog. Hopefully casting will continue that trend.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-10 22:15:55	@Lyndzzz Monday here :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-10 22:43:20	@RedmondSurvivor @SurvivorWizard Who comes up with how good it is before it airs? People who work on the show?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 20:18:14	@ChadKincaid1 @mrsredsox0923 if you deactivate your account you're giving that person power.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 00:27:59	@FindMyNervous I think that part has been happening for a while. At least on the iPhone app
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 00:28:51	@FindMyNervous or was it just replies before?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 04:25:33	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim "Who raised that kid?" Lol. #Survivor #RHAP
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 04:32:13	Seriously Alec sucks. At least @jeremy2collins has manners. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 04:39:54	@ReneJHerrera @jeremy2collins Alec is a punk. He has been all season. Little bro syndrome.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 04:41:31	@ARTIS_Survivor my mind was playing tricks on me on the couch!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 04:45:16	@ReneJHerrera Ewwww. Lol. Too young!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 04:57:37	Tribal was hilarious. And they actually got out a strong player! #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 04:58:03	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I guess that's what season 30 is for.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 04:59:25	I love @joshuacanfield and @thereedkelly, but happy the other cocky boys got burned. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 05:02:18	@ReneJHerrera Don't forget the burping too. Haha.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 05:04:00	@joshuacanfield Loved watching you. You played the game out of the gate.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 05:12:25	@ReneJHerrera and season 30 doesn't start til Feb. 25
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-14 17:28:51	@DaltonRoss Hint. Individual/family plans are just plain worse than a lot of the group plans out there.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-14 19:10:36	#workout #sweat Better than sitting on the couch. I'll save that for Sunday ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 16:21:36	Thank you Twitter for the "turn off retweets" function.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-13 16:24:05	@jeremy2collins @ValCollins_ Haha. Is she putting you to shame? Dig deep ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-14 22:30:07	@realityblurred Oh man. So sad :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-15 00:35:48	@GirlPakProds I saw this earlier. Sad :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-12 19:56:20	@MartyCaswell how do they look out there? This could make a big difference.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-12 19:57:19	@FindMyNervous seriously? That's terrible. Are they trying to minimize how much we tweet? Annoying.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-17 04:17:12	My favorite pair on tv by far are @mcbridemelissa and @wwwbigbaldhead of The Walking Dead. Love them!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-17 04:20:13	@robstaboobuzzer they seem to be slowing down the storyline for a couple of eps. At least the entire season isn't like SJDS
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-17 04:21:13	@KassMcQ they can't all be winners I suppose.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-17 04:22:50	@RHAPfan21 loved him on the show. Not so much on twitter
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-17 05:38:38	@joshuacanfield Omg. I love you even more! Too many players like the attention they get from him... Ugh.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-17 05:45:15	@ReneJHerrera @MischNImposible They all just realized this. But better late than never.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-17 06:43:51	@ReneJHerrera @kelleywentworth You know REN if you weren't before, you're blocked by him now üòÆ Try not to lose sleep.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-18 00:05:58	@UTgehlken Oops. Loose lips...
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-18 02:56:31	@SpencerBGM LOVE it. He threatens and bullies non-contestants too!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-18 03:52:16	@ReneJHerrera what the hell is Surge? Is that like a pre Redbull?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-16 01:26:20	@RHAPfan21 you ok there?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-17 17:23:10	@fymaxwell @TheWesRogers Did you read the rest of his tweets? They were ugly, rude and uncalled for.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-17 22:02:26	@MartyCaswell why wasn't he more involved then? To bring him back slowly?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-16 21:12:22	@TBMWolverine Sorry about the traffic. Just missed a nice TD. Where are you driving from?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-16 21:17:34	@TBMWolverine Wow. Accident? It takes us less from LA usually.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-16 22:02:04	@MartyCaswell Penalties are killing us. You would think they would've cleaned it up.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-17 00:00:43	@UTKevinAcee makes up for penalties earlier!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-19 20:48:30	@goofygal1171 Uh, yeah ;) My favorite new show! Glad you found it.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:18:30	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim which part? The food?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:21:18	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim more specific?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:56:02	Point proven. Giving away your reward doesn't buy loyalty. Ugh. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:56:22	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim oops. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 05:03:58	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim oh and Abig... Shit. I don't remember my tribe name.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-21 18:23:18	@robstaboobuzzer Meaning: Get your ass off the couch. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-21 18:25:15	@robstaboobuzzer "Studying"
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-21 19:32:24	@robstaboobuzzer btw how are you watching BB? CBS access?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-21 19:33:29	@ReneJHerrera @nofate1991 @DearFranny @robstaboobuzzer REN you need to get out more!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-21 19:43:17	@robstaboobuzzer hmmm. YouTube? Cool. I've never seen Dr. Will's first seafon
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-21 20:53:06	@joshuacanfield Josh what's your favorite pizza in NY? Whenever my boyfriend and I go to NY, all we want are pizza and bagels #carbs
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-21 20:58:19	@joshuacanfield @TwoBootsHQ Hmmm. It looks like they have some in LA. May have to try :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:15:51	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim All of them?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:17:54	@ReneJHerrera are you trying to say one moment of food that you're going to barf up anyway doesn't equate to 1 million dollars? #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:19:28	@ReneJHerrera Yep. People have given away cars. Don't matter.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:20:56	Giving away food that people will get sick off anyway won't win you a million dollars. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:22:46	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Yeah. But he doesn't owe anyone. Contestants have given away cars in the past and that didn't matter.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:25:22	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I hated the kissing weeks ago! Reed does have nice eyes ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:27:31	@robcesternino @ReneJHerrera Lol. I love the bluff calling.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:37:01	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim what time lunch Mon?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:40:11	@robcesternino @GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I think Deb may be referring to Jeremy as the "giganti-bulge" shot.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:40:22	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim either works.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:57:13	Not happy @jeremy2collins was voted out. Who can trust the couple that's been flip flopping all game? #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 04:57:45	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds why is everyone trusting that couple?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 05:03:02	It's bizarre that Jon and Jaclyn have been given so much power by the rest of the players. Stop that! #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 05:06:52	@ReneJHerrera that would be the smart thing to do.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 05:17:04	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Ha. No, not similar to meatballs. Something like Abigarro. But I'm missing letters.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 05:18:56	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Lol. You should've tagged her in this. She would've been like, wtf?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 05:21:02	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim the last 2 eps have been pretty good imo and I like them both too. Didn't see Jeremy going tonight.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-19 00:49:03	@Hayden_Moss Bagels. Pizza. Must eats.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 22:39:42	Wow Twitter is ageist! It asks me to fill out a survey to make the experience better, but when I put my age it says I'm disqualified.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 22:47:36	@FindMyNervous I agree. Every time I do, my battery life freaks out.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 22:50:21	@FindMyNervous ugh. Do you update through wifi or computer? I hear it's better to do through computer.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-20 17:10:56	@UTKevinAcee Was reading your article. Why do you think Keenan has been slipping so much? Is it the way he's cutting or planting his feet?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-23 22:01:14	@UTKevinAcee Why do you think they pull Mathews inside the 20? Seems nonsensical pulling the most effective player on the field.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-24 23:02:56	@UTKevinAcee Is he a bit surly? Not sure what he expects.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-24 23:08:18	Don't we look sharp in our brand new #RHAP shirts? As @GirlPakProds says, X-mas came early :) @dexterleekim http://t.co/mBZ8L5b9uU
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-24 23:20:11	@robstaboobuzzer Yep. Gotta represent.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-25 00:22:28	@robstaboobuzzer good job :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-24 00:19:51	@MartyCaswell No. Miami will hold that honors for a long time to come.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-24 02:38:08	@jeremy2collins I knew I made the right decision playing him on fantasy today!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-25 05:18:18	@teetomterrific why friend? :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-25 05:24:41	@teetomterrific sorry to hear that.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-26 18:17:21	@robstaboobuzzer thinking of getting the 6. How do you like yours?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-26 18:26:06	@robstaboobuzzer I definitely don't want the plus. @mrsredsox0923 Is the regular much larger than the 5?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-27 03:40:56	Watching #MasterChefJuniors always puts a smile on my face. Those kids are amazing &amp; I love how they support each other.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-27 22:27:22	@ReneJHerrera Happy Thanksgiving!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-27 22:28:55	@ReneJHerrera uh thanks? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-27 04:14:30	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim what?!? Where are your priorities?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-27 04:15:51	Stop giving away rewards! #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-27 04:26:01	@ReneJHerrera what'd it say?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-27 04:56:10	Natalie saved Jon big time! He had no idea he needed to play the idol. Smart player. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-30 04:06:41	I love how on old school Big Brother, they didn't all dress up when they knew they'd be on tv. Krista's in a robe w/a towel on her head.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-30 20:10:12	Penalties and turnovers are killing us. For several games now. Clean it up please. #Chargers
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-30 20:49:19	The way to not get called for PI is to actually turn around towards the ball. Football 101. #Chargers
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-30 21:26:14	Gritty win #Chargers!!! Love that you never give up!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-11-30 23:29:05	@sdutCanepa @MartyCaswell I love Weddle too, but he shoved him way after the ball was thrown. Hopefully he changes his tune when he see tape
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-01 00:21:40	@goofygal1171 That didn't take you long #bingewatched #metoo ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-01 00:27:18	@daxshepard1 @IMKristenBell Love your commercial together! Especially the pups at the dinner table. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-01 19:00:50	@ReneJHerrera Damn. I wish!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-01 19:03:20	@ReneJHerrera why is it on a Wed?!?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-01 19:08:29	@ReneJHerrera That's what we can say about you coming out for finale üòù But you never know. #finances #sched You in 4 sure?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-01 19:12:44	@ReneJHerrera I love NY! How long are you going for?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-01 04:09:11	Beth's character has come such a long way. Sad to see her go. #TheWalkingDead
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-01 05:07:36	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim He is totally getting a hero edit.  I think Keith is gonna win. Haha.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-01 05:08:30	@thereedkelly that was a rough one when Daryll's walking her out :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-02 16:54:49	@robstaboobuzzer what did you do to get blocked?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-03 03:27:52	@goofygal1171 Hey D! I had no desire to go into work today, but it was exactly what the dr. ordered. Helped my head a lot! :) #loveourwork
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-03 16:19:24	@goofygal1171 Aha. I love Jax :) Be warned that it can get pretty violent esp as series goes on. Did you watch Breaking Bad? #mustsee
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-03 18:25:55	@goofygal1171 Love/hate is good way to put it. Love his body ;) (tho he is young then) Yay on Breaking Bad. Truly 1 of the best shows ever!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-03 18:30:16	@goofygal1171 Btw, for a totally diff type of show, but very well written, acted etc is Mad Men. Put it on your list if you haven't seen.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 04:17:06	@robstaboobuzzer @JeffProbst @MarkBurnettTV he seemed pissed they were at each other's throats. But order revealed itself anyway.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 04:18:02	@ReneJHerrera @thereedkelly Such a brat ;) Lol. Love it.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 04:33:40	The meat collector likes his cream cheese. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 04:51:31	Exile takes its toll. Jon's crabby. Jac is mad he won't talk to her, yet she walks away when he tries. Couple fighting. BvW. #survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 04:58:33	@robstaboobuzzer @TheGameSurvivor what?!? The rest of us got blocked forever ago!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 05:03:35	@thereedkelly bummer seeing you go. I was really hoping you could pull it off!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 06:01:09	@ReneJHerrera Omg. Seriously? Is that even legal? #escalation
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 06:02:15	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Deb, I'm not really sure how you feel... haha
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 06:02:49	@robstaboobuzzer winners edit
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 06:05:37	@GirlPakProds @USPS at least you get your mail. My postal carriers get it wrong almost daily.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 06:46:48	@MischNImposible @JaclynMSchultz Unfortunately there are a lot of idiots out there who hate just to hate. Sorry this is part of it :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 05:15:16	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim so much hate Deb. What happened? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 05:40:30	@ReneJHerrera and I was thinking I hope you ordered the xtra bed for me when I just show up
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 21:27:57	@Survivor_Tweet $500,000? Wrong show.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 21:28:35	@joshuacanfield with those amazing blue eyes... @thereedkelly
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 06:24:21	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Exile really does take a toll ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 06:27:21	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim do you get wine too?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-05 01:07:47	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera I'm rooting for Cowboys kicker. #FantasyFootball
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-05 01:08:41	@FindMyNervous somehow I didn't picture you with a Barbie doll. But if it's Ken, I guess it's ok ;) #cute
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-05 01:39:48	@jeremy2collins already?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 18:11:20	@robstaboobuzzer you really hate this season huh?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 18:12:57	@robstaboobuzzer what're you trying to sway?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 18:15:34	@robstaboobuzzer That's what I thought. And I agree. They can do better. And should.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-04 19:28:25	I'm kinda pissed off. But it just makes me more inspired to be magnificent and not ordinary!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-06 19:59:49	Going to the gym after a night of flowing wine = me having aged 20 years. No stamina.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-06 22:11:27	@robstaboobuzzer my favorite season!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-06 23:25:39	@GirlPakProds nice
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-05 19:40:42	@CherylStrayed Hi! Check out the WGA article on your movie and the screenwriter Nick Hornby! http://t.co/3HFCo7nFwa
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-08 04:37:29	Never feels good to lose, but I'm proud of the Defense. They gave us a chance. #Chargers
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-06 07:25:28	@goofygal1171 this hurts my heart deeply
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-06 18:00:53	@KassMcQ Ha. I'm curious who or what motivated this tweet. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-08 22:31:01	@UTgehlken it's really not that hard to understand. Not sure what the fixation is on that of all the pts to fixate on
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-08 22:32:29	@UTgehlken then ask why the play calling went away from what had been the only thing effective.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-08 23:19:50	@UTKevinAcee Yep. Chargers fans kinda suck. Nothing new unfortunately.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-09 03:42:08	@dribbleglass it's akin to offering to take someone to the airport
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-10 20:07:25	@goofygal1171 Series finale was last night. What season are you on? #junkie
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-10 20:14:07	@goofygal1171 Ha. Just what you need to keep you warm: violence, sex and outlaws ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-10 20:24:06	@goofygal1171 I still can't wait til you watch #BreakingBad. Walter White, Jessie Pinkman... You'll get to know them well :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-10 23:45:17	What's the point of a unicycle?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-11 04:16:10	Rule change. No more giving away rewards to whomever one wishes. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-11 04:18:02	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim where are my peeps? This giving away rewards is killing me.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-11 04:24:43	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I'm with you on that one!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-11 04:30:05	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Probably more. You think?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-11 04:30:34	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim yeah if she has to go that sux. Terrible.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-11 04:34:41	Props to Missy for being a tough momma and not giving up. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-11 04:41:50	@tomtumillo @ReneJHerrera so does Eliza
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-11 04:45:18	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds didn't read the synopsis. Don't spoil us :0
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-11 04:55:16	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds Well that was anticlimactic since my boyfriend spoiled us!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-11 04:57:43	So I go to great lengths to not be spoiled on social media, and my boyfriend spoils me on social media. Ugh. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-11 04:58:48	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds No excuses. You flat out spoiled us. You're cut off.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-11 04:59:21	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Ahem I got 2 solid contenders, lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-11 05:01:00	This is the season the winners edit died. At least it's not been obvious. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-11 05:03:08	@ReneJHerrera maybe you'll find out in the March?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-13 21:54:50	@RHAPfan21 where you going?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-13 19:00:57	@JeffProbst typical couples fight. But she held onto her anger longer while he was trying to mend.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-15 19:29:40	@UTgehlken it really sux that our fans can't be a factor :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-15 19:30:56	@UTKevinAcee That's noble, but charger fans are just fair weathered. Always have been.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-16 04:04:40	@jeremy2collins Ha. Where are you that happy hour started at 3pm. Need to get myself over there, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-16 04:09:26	@jeremy2collins Ah yeah. Been there many a time back in the day.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-14 21:47:52	Come on #Chargers offense. You gotta get something going!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-14 22:31:16	@UTKevinAcee absolutely. But wtf that holding wasn't called?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-15 02:32:23	@MartyCaswell Ah. Poor guy. Not even close to his fault.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-16 01:32:16	@ReneJHerrera weird
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-16 20:56:19	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Omg. So right and so wrong at the same time! Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-14 18:24:12	@robstaboobuzzer @JeffProbst yep. Been there :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-17 01:22:28	@FindMyNervous Abby is such a sweetie. And I adored Oona.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-17 01:26:04	@FindMyNervous Not my fav either... I'd be surprised if he doesn't.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-14 20:30:29	@UTgehlken you may like the kid but it does seem others are able to play through injury more than he's able.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-14 20:35:37	@UTgehlken Of course not broken bones. And not earlier injury this year. But what's the prob today? Do we not have enough info to judge?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-14 20:36:13	@UTgehlken For the record, I like the kid. I just wish he'd be able to stay on field cause we need him.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-17 06:24:31	@ChadKincaid1 @ReneJHerrera I've met her a couple of times in the last year and she wasn't very nice. So either she's changed or its me, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 04:11:24	@fymaxwell @teetomterrific that's the most airtime he got. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 04:12:39	@salomey5 seriously. I love Survivor. And I'm really ready for this season to be over.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 04:42:19	Wow. Huge advantage paid off. #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 04:43:24	Haha. All their faces - looks of bewilderment. Keith wins immunity with huge advantage. And patience. #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 04:46:22	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim it's really distracting me!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 04:57:33	"Cons, you have no one you can 100 percent trust." -- says Jax with 4 days to go. Can't wait til BvW is no longer a thing. #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 04:57:58	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim exactly!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 05:03:27	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds actually good sport
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 05:05:39	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds I'm coming on strong. Keith for the win. #spit
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 05:11:58	Lol. Who would've thought in the beginning of the season people would be saying Keith is scary? #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 05:15:54	Are they all moving in slo-mo on this final challenge? #SurivorFinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 05:23:00	@SpencerBGM who you calling goon? Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 05:34:32	Seriously. Is Alec stoned or is that really his look? #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 05:36:04	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Yep. Looks like MonoGordo for the win.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 05:36:22	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim not John Rocker?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 05:36:55	@skraz Lol. Ugh.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 03:27:50	Great winner of #MasterChefJunior. He truly has great spirit and a wonderful attitude.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 04:14:37	@salomey5 I just started watching. On west coast. I won't check your tweets ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 04:24:14	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Does Jeff look weird to you guys?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 04:27:20	@SurvivorWiki @JeffProbst Survivor isn't just about competing in challenges. Criteria is about persons health
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 04:35:14	@robstaboobuzzer 1 year ago was my first #SurvivorFinale party :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 05:21:46	Damn. Goes to show never give up! Nice comeback Jaclyn. #SurivorFinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 05:51:38	I feel like I deserve to win the million dollars cause I've had stuff happen to me in my life. #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 05:55:31	Lol. @thereedkelly face every time Missy speaks at final tribal. #survivorfinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 06:02:33	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim funny. But kinda coming across as pretentious. He definitely has a bite.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 06:05:06	@ReneJHerrera About female winners? Or the caliber of the female winner?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 06:06:19	No offense to any of the cast, but please no more seasons of blood vs water. Thanks. #SurivorFinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 06:06:39	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds he's got eating to do
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 06:13:31	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Damn. Congrats Mono Gordo
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 06:23:49	How many blackouts did Natalie have in Survivor? Lol. #SurivorFinale
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 06:25:05	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim at least I had a shot this time.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 06:38:15	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Gloating isn't attractive. Haha.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 06:40:19	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Where do you want lunch this time? Should we all wear our #RHAP shirts?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 07:25:08	@ColtonCumbie heart
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-17 18:35:16	@FiligirlFu @JeffProbst you should ask if he cares that he was showed spitting every episode. I assume not.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-17 19:19:49	@robstaboobuzzer I really am not. Tell me why?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 16:42:37	@Brown17Keith Let's hope so!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 16:45:56	@GetOnSurvivor @truedorktimes I would still rather hear from any of the players than ransoms in the audience.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 16:53:35	@ReneJHerrera ahem, do tell. Or at least why conflicted? Cause of the players or theme?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 16:54:30	@robstaboobuzzer you have a change of heart?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 22:55:52	@FindMyNervous what about season 4?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 18:12:17	@RHAPfan21 or maybe cause it's not season 29 ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 18:13:08	@NatalieeAnd Congrats on your win! You earned it.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 18:13:48	@RHAPfan21 yeah. It was a long season. But good winner.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 18:14:35	@SpencerBGM Love Penner. How long are you in LA?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 18:33:00	@gordonholmes @JeffProbst Love that they didn't just settle for what would've been obvious all stars season. It can be fun, but also lazy
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 22:57:29	@FindMyNervous Yeah. Terrible ending. It does put a damper
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 20:31:58	@goofygal1171 @DaltonRoss @MsMelissaMaerz Good read. Hadn't thought about the double bind. Just thought he was being pretentious and petty
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-19 21:28:00	@jodiwincheski Costa Rica is a great choice. Love it there.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-17 21:10:58	@robstaboobuzzer @GutULykaFish Yes Jt! Buzzer, you have to come out for season 30!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-17 21:20:11	@robstaboobuzzer @GutULykaFish yeah not sure it will go back to Sun, but sounds like it will be a good season and worth it hopefully :)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 00:14:35	@SpencerBGM and I see you went to the Brazilian place in the farmers market. Been there several times.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 00:16:36	@ReneJHerrera Was gonna say something snarky. Then I decided not to.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 02:53:23	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Abigarrado for the win! Go Keith (or muffin)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-18 02:56:51	@ReneJHerrera Will you and Buzzer please come out for season 30? Gotta do it right!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-21 22:25:16	@robstaboobuzzer awesome. But will you let your kicker kick some field goals? I need the points! #FantasyFootball
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-21 23:05:06	@robstaboobuzzer grrr. Negative pts :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-21 23:08:51	@robstaboobuzzer Ha. Right now he has 3pts total. But yeah keep scoring TDs too. Gotta win the championship
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-21 23:47:34	@JohnMCochran *hugs* though you probably don't want to be touched. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-21 02:23:03	@UTKevinAcee should Rivers sit? Seems like a liability with his injuries :(
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-21 03:01:41	@UTKevinAcee and we can't even blame Norv.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-21 05:17:57	Omg!!! I can't believe the #Chargers pulled it off. I'm still shaking.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-21 05:30:50	@hardwina @dexterleekim In Hardwick we trust!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-22 01:15:12	@UTKevinAcee Don't stop being you. At the very least it's entertaining! ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-22 01:15:44	@robstaboobuzzer congrats. when's the last time they went?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-22 03:14:37	@robstaboobuzzer @Hawk_941 Sorry Hawk. Chargers fan here. You watch last nights game?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-22 17:30:03	@thereedkelly @MalcolmWHW What did the others attack her for? Lack of gameplay or the "mother" role? Wonder why they didn't include it.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-21 19:47:22	@thereedkelly do you get tired of people asking to follow you?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-23 04:47:30	Who cares about my #Survivor league... I just won #FantasyFootball!!! #moneymoney
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-25 05:55:31	@robstaboobuzzer Merry Xmas Buzzer!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-27 19:24:47	@MartyCaswell Are you the most unlucky traveler ever?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-28 19:28:34	@UTKevinAcee yeah. Worth a shot though.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-28 19:39:23	@hardwina @EddieRoyalWR @AntonioGates85 @Chargers you got a feeling Hardwick?
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-28 01:18:18	@robstaboobuzzer I've heard it's amazing.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-28 21:30:10	@MartyCaswell huge injuries on O line didn't help.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-25 00:28:36	@meehand Adorable. Merry Christmas Dawn!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-28 23:22:32	@MartyCaswell Yep. Plus Hardwick, Clary, the list goes on. Obviously disappointed, but only so much the team can overcome.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-29 05:41:07	@CherylStrayed Read Wild a while back and it spoke to me on so many levels. Now just saw the movie. Captured the essence beautifully.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-29 02:08:10	@UTKevinAcee Those who are reactionary are missing the bigger picture. Too much to overcome from very start of the season w key injuries.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-29 17:28:50	@robstaboobuzzer Janie blocked you? Hahaha. Love her, Kaysar and Howie!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-29 17:50:24	@robstaboobuzzer cough. Of course you're an angel.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-29 22:07:17	@goofygal1171 Oh cool! I never heard back from them. If I had known they were gonna send you what I wrote, I would've been more eloquent! ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-29 22:20:45	@goofygal1171 Lol. And after all your Viagra junk mail!
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-30 04:31:17	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I don't.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-30 20:46:06	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim hmm. He should try back. Hopefully they're not in the middle of moving.
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-30 21:16:43	@ReneJHerrera I unfollowed him months ago ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2014-12-31 06:22:45	@Lyndzzz Ha. That's probably what I average too! Happy New Years!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-02 21:10:26	@ChargerTalkLine hope that's true! He'd kickass as a guard.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-01 01:45:38	@ReneJHerrera sisters :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-01 21:12:57	@drdrew @Firstladyoflove Yep. Woke me up too! And then we walked over to the parade.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-02 00:48:39	@joshuacanfield @thereedkelly beautiful pic!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-03 20:26:12	@RHAPfan21 you gonna share?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-05 21:09:18	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim We need to set up a time for your victory lunch.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-06 01:10:56	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds lol. Just got this.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-05 00:38:29	Nfl playoff rule #1: if you intercept the ball with with 2min to go, go down.  Bad memories :(
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-05 00:39:34	@FiligirlFu exactly!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-05 00:46:52	Well at least Lawrence got to redeem himself. Sorry Lions. #NFLPlayoffs
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-05 00:47:25	@robstaboobuzzer congrats. I picked them to win in the pickem pool so I'm still alive ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-06 04:45:33	Gerardo's a plant, right? #CelebrityApprentice
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-06 05:19:17	@IanZiering so fun watching you on Celebrity Apprentice! Hope you go far!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-05 00:50:12	@FiligirlFu yes. My team lost a big playoff game to Patriots years ago cause the dip was didn't go down! Still mad. Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-06 20:50:59	@WriterRickBarry happy bday!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-07 02:52:52	@RedmondSurvivor hmm. What rules were broken?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-07 16:46:31	"I can see my words written on your face" @CherylStrayed said to @RWitherspoon after seeing Wild. I couldn't have said it better myself.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-07 18:57:28	Lesson learned. Always go straight to promotions/retention dept for discounts on services. Just got amazing deals for Internet and phone :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-08 00:11:51	@GirlPakProds what's their opinion been?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-08 02:53:02	@jodiwincheski @kevinjonas I was almost wondering if he was a plant. Does anyone truly act that way? Ugh.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-09 00:01:39	@drdrew any more celeb rehabs in the future?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-09 18:20:47	Ok, I admit it. I suck at Trivia Crack. But I still want more!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-11 00:59:07	Omg. There it is. Terrible way to lose a playoff game.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-11 00:59:38	@MartyCaswell painful
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-12 00:52:02	I actually like Peyton, but I'm not unhappy that the Broncos lost. #NFLPlayoffs
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-12 22:53:01	@UTKevinAcee seems familiar. Hopefully it bites them in the ass.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-12 04:30:56	@lenadunham Awesome start to #Girls. Already jonesin' for next week's episode.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-13 04:45:36	My eyes! Geraldo pumping iron in his underwear is a sight I can't un-see! #CelebrityApprentice
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-13 20:45:18	@realityblurred do you know why Bastianich left?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-15 04:11:40	@FindMyNervous Where's Dee? She took a ride on the carousel. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-14 01:24:54	@FindMyNervous Seriously? Best news all day!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-16 04:56:03	@salomey5 good luck.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-15 16:29:22	@FindMyNervous that's what I feel about the movies this year. I thought a lot were very good, but were they best pic quality?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-15 16:49:54	@FindMyNervous what did you think of the episode? It was good to see the gang back, but maybe a bit lacking?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-15 16:55:13	@FindMyNervous always love the gang :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-15 20:44:15	@realityblurred great interview. It answered a lot of questions I had.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-18 01:24:41	@goofygal1171 very good choice! "What's happening hot stuff?"
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-17 06:47:45	@robstaboobuzzer Happy Birthday Buzzer!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-16 23:55:34	@ReneJHerrera omg. Not a compliment! Lol
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-17 03:54:05	@goofygal1171 Are you talking to anyone in particular or has the beer gone to your head? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-18 21:09:29	Seriously Seattle. Pathetic. Glad you're not my team. Pissed I picked you for the pickem pool though.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-18 21:13:11	@FiligirlFu Lol. Going with the odds. Money is at stake. Fyi, I had Jordy on my fantasy team this year and I won! Hmmmm
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-18 21:22:01	@FiligirlFu this has been a season long pickem. I'm still in it, but possibly not for long.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-18 22:08:37	Wow! What a fake! Go big or go home I suppose. #GBvsSEA
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-18 23:10:07	Omg! Lynch does it again! #GBvsSEA
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-18 23:30:37	What a come back Seattle! Back to back Superbowls! Congrats!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-18 23:30:50	@FiligirlFu sorry :(
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-18 23:51:00	@FiligirlFu totally agree with prevent D. Never works.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-21 05:07:41	@RedmondSurvivor as long as you argue and talk trash to those who ask you questions or disagree with you.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-22 04:43:46	@marissamayer @theshirin Love to hear about those who finally make it after trying out for years
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-21 19:23:38	@RHAPfan21 Is Max being your number 1 a homer pick?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-21 19:24:44	@RHAPfan21 Ah yes. You and the beards ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-21 19:25:43	@ReneJHerrera you getting your flight ready for the finale? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-21 19:54:45	@ReneJHerrera Yay! So much fun to be had...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-21 19:57:14	@robstaboobuzzer Haha! Of course Buzzer! No take prisoners finale without you!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-21 19:59:12	@robstaboobuzzer yeah I 100% relate nowadays. I feel the samd
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-21 20:02:39	@robstaboobuzzer that just shows the passion. Definitely tough.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-21 20:09:47	@robstaboobuzzer @fymaxwell Hi Max, glad to hear a huge fan got on. Congrats!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-21 21:50:28	@truedorktimes perhaps it's an argument to cast actual applicants? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-21 22:05:24	@Kirblar024 @truedorktimes I agree they need longer to cast BvW, but I'd be happy if they don't for quite a while. Not my favorite premise
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-21 23:56:07	@Hawk_941 @robstaboobuzzer Not exactly, but some version of buzzzified recently.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-22 00:03:53	@Hawk_941 @robstaboobuzzer thanks. I can still hold out hope for the future. :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-22 16:26:10	@fymaxwell Ouch. That's actually funny.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-22 22:37:55	@ReneJHerrera @fymaxwell REN was just a baby back then.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-23 05:30:36	@fymaxwell @theabimaria do you spend all your time in Topanga or do you venture out east a bit? Btw, love kale
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-23 05:59:33	@fymaxwell Lol. I'm just a bit east from that and as far as I go generally is probably Fairfax. But I get it. You have hikes and beach :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-23 06:02:55	Just ate my way through the Best New Restaurants in LA. I must be a traditionalist at heart cause I loved Scopa Italian Roots.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-29 20:15:26	@daxshepard1 Will miss the Bravermans! Excellent show and enjoyed watching you embrace the role of Crosby.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-28 23:00:29	@GetOnSurvivor which alums?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-31 05:28:05	Goodbye #Parenthood. Great show. Tearjerker of a finale.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-30 16:24:26	@robstaboobuzzer Lol, welcome to adolescence.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-01-31 16:24:05	@RedmondSurvivor what were the finals in Dec? Or did they not happen?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-02 00:57:36	@SpencerBGM question is will you pay up and honor your deal?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-03 01:29:10	@SpencerBGM you should make Pete Carroll pay up for not running Marshawn down there. At least he can afford it.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-02 03:13:05	I don't hate Seattle, but for all the smack talk Richard Sherman does, I'm not sad to see them lose. #SuperBowl
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-02 03:24:46	@SpencerBGM I am not a Pats fan, but gotta run Lynch down there. Fail.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-03 04:59:19	Kenya = The Worst #CelebApprentice
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-03 06:02:14	Wtf? Trump fires the whole team and Ian doesn't even get an aired exit statement. Way to finagle that final 3. #CelebrityApprentice
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-03 16:35:36	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim are you suggesting that isn't fun?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-03 22:21:28	@Hayden_Moss it truly is a dark day.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-01 17:06:53	@RHAPfan21 wash your mouth out with soap! ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-05 00:16:09	@salomey5 she's the worst. Kenya that is.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-05 16:21:04	@SpencerBGM Ha. Love it. And until now, I didn't care at all about Mr. Survivor.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-05 17:25:37	@ReneJHerrera Weird. Maybe it's a recruit thing?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-07 04:13:04	@fymaxwell Shit, I think I'm friends with survivor superfans. Who is it?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-05 17:09:13	@ReneJHerrera what did you say? Love drama early in the morning.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-06 05:31:44	@SpencerBGM @ReneJHerrera @kelleywentworth That's all REN knows how to be ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-08 04:41:50	@spic298251 did your account get hacked?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-06 16:28:43	@goofygal1171 picturing that made me laugh out loud.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-08 18:24:15	@goofygal1171 Denise, The Walking Dead starts back up tonight! Whew! It's been too long...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-08 20:48:51	@FindMyNervous @ChocoIatePie Fiona has definitely morphed over time. I used to think she was the stable one.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-08 20:50:27	@FindMyNervous @ChocoIatePie Yeah, definitely. Especially considering how young she was and having to be the parent.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-09 03:44:40	@DaltonRoss I liked seeing the internal process of his dying. It said a lot about the life they're in.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-09 03:45:05	@FindMyNervous about to watch :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-10 03:36:08	@FindMyNervous is it creepy?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-11 03:47:27	@ReneJHerrera @robcesternino uh oh. What did you do now?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-11 03:49:00	@RedmondSurvivor you know Early was claiming both would be returnee seasons months ago. And these that are airing. Gag. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-11 05:17:25	@FindMyNervous If you can watch Shameless early this week, it's worth it. On Showtime Anytime.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-12 16:20:28	@FindMyNervous You can use Showtime Anytime through a device like iPad, iPhone, computer... I do that and cast it to the tv.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-12 22:03:57	@SharLiu they came out nice!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-15 01:35:45	@robcesternino At least she doesn't want to see it with you. Awkward.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-15 22:19:44	@GirlPakProds That's like "Ew, this tastes gross. Here you try." Uh, no...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-16 05:34:45	@NinaPoersch Have you read the book? It's amazing.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-16 16:50:41	@ejsnyder333 I hope you will be doing something amazing and that I'd be jealou of ;) Enjoy!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-16 17:16:04	@SpencerBGM Aha. You've learned my young friend. Maybe that alone will earn my vote.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-16 17:16:49	@SpencerBGM Done.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-16 18:19:01	@robstaboobuzzer Yeah. I thought it was worth watching and interesting, but also a small story. If that makes sense.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-16 18:13:15	@robstaboobuzzer did you watch Night Crawler?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-17 00:35:19	@ReneJHerrera @alliepohevitz questions like that ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-17 00:51:10	@ReneJHerrera @alliepohevitz Hehe. You know I'm joshin' ya. Plus Allie seems to have a thicker skin than some of the others :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-19 01:39:58	@RedmondSurvivor any idea when they start filming 31?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-17 06:07:37	Great winner @LeezaGibbons #CelebrityApprentice. Classy, smart and kind.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-20 16:34:57	@UTKevinAcee How is it a betrayal? They've tried for years to stay. SD hasn't stepped up.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-20 22:36:21	@UTKevinAcee Interesting response from the Mayor. Would think he'd not air all this out in the public. What you think?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-20 17:33:04	Finally started watching #Survivor cast videos. Soooo much better. Thank you, thank you!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-20 17:47:04	@UTKevinAcee True, you did say feels. I do agree it hurts. It really sucks. I just get that Chargers pov. I suppose you do too.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-21 02:44:30	@fymaxwell I've had that wellness formula on the counter. Works amazingly well.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-20 21:13:49	@MartyCaswell that's exactly my point.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-21 02:43:17	@meehand Hi Dawn :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-21 05:51:25	@goofygal1171 all for you or to share? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-21 21:51:01	@UTKevinAcee Been a fan since I was 8. I don't understand this type of b/w response knowing they've been trying to stay for years.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-23 05:10:15	@salomey5 really? I think it went long.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-24 05:56:34	Wonder who I should follow from season 30 #Survivor. 2 more days...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-23 01:45:25	"Call your mom. Call your dad." JK Simmons. Love it. #Oscars
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-23 02:09:35	@realityblurred did you like his intro?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-23 03:38:40	@realityblurred I agree. Lost some of the connection we have to them.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-22 17:49:15	@robstaboobuzzer glad you're still with us buzzer. :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-22 18:47:41	@fymaxwell could be helpful for my survivor draft?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-24 17:02:43	@GirlPakProds how do you like your tribe? Did Dex tell you how I missed Tyler was still on the board? Stupid Mongrels. Name change to come
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-24 17:44:24	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Ok. The official name is #ChokingCollars
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-24 18:06:17	Will the #Dirty30 live up to the hype and surpass Cagayan as one of the most exciting seasons of #Survivor in years? Or is hype just hype?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-24 20:52:53	I wanted @remington231 for my draft, but she got swooped up fast. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 06:47:46	@GirlPakProds now you just need to quit social media ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 17:00:43	@goofygal1171 what's happening out there?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 17:02:29	@goofygal1171 Geez. Does that mean it's a snow day? Or does everyone still have to go in? I can ship you some sun if you like.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 20:59:27	@ucantdothat121 SoCal. But I have to wait for the west coast feed.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 03:40:08	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Rumble from the fear of being choked by the #ChokingCollars ;) #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 06:29:07	@MalcolmWHW @So_Kim looks like you're enamored.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 16:35:04	@truedorktimes Oh I see. Well good news is they continually change their minds if true. Terrible idea.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 17:08:19	@RynoHammond @truedorktimes really? I didn't see that...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 23:36:39	@ReneJHerrera @fymaxwell @truedorktimes @clamperls That's where knowing so much about the game can backfire?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-27 00:09:29	@meehand @ReneJHerrera Now I'm just jealous. Everyone's met Dawn in person and gotten bread :( Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-27 00:22:07	@ReneJHerrera @meehand Maybe you and I could split a loaf ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 03:47:18	@ReneJHerrera she seriously won? How?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-27 01:27:31	@meehand @ReneJHerrera Yep no shade on my part either. You're awesome Dawn.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-27 01:28:02	@robstaboobuzzer @LauraJHolz @meehand yummmmmy
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 01:20:56	@fymaxwell excited and jealous!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 01:26:16	@fymaxwell Are you like a kid in a candy store with the season starting tomorrow? The second half of the Survivor experience...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-27 04:34:42	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim will it ever get old?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 17:12:14	@goofygal1171 all evening activities except for Survivor. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 17:12:46	@fymaxwell I assume you found an east coast feed.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 03:49:05	@ReneJHerrera yeah I guess that's obvious.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 05:33:40	@truedorktimes they do love themselves it seems
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 05:39:30	@chxdigme Love that you never gave up applying. Did you make it to finals other times before you were picked? Looking foreard to tomorrow!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 05:40:39	@truedorktimes Yeah. And we'll love them for it. But for now I have a little bit of eye rolling going on, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-27 05:51:35	An original Melanie Random. May she rest in peace. http://t.co/RSQHk6gYCS
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-27 05:54:07	@So_Kim @DearFranny Kindred spirits. Good sports.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 07:11:19	So the Twitter ban for #Survivor players lasted one season? Lol. Not that I'm complaining...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 00:31:53	@fymaxwell Yep. Big fan too. And I have those who've told me not to give up. Hopefully I'll be in your position. Enjoy!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 00:35:26	@ReneJHerrera @fymaxwell REN is so sad :(
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 16:21:18	@JeffProbst It's been a while since you've hyped a season so much. I attribute it to casting  a bunch of diehards.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-25 22:04:02	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Enjoy #Survivor hours before me tonight :( I'll be there on the flip.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 04:26:11	So (who calls herself the devil) feels like she's making a deal with the devil, Joaquin. Fitting? #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 04:39:27	@ReneJHerrera so no collar of him.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 04:47:33	Uh oh. Jealousy and #Survivor aren't a good combo.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 05:06:55	Damn. White collar outsmarted themselves. Should've been a gimme.  #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 05:19:09	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim underwear by far
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 05:26:42	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim So much for #ChokingCollars starting strong. No pun intended.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 05:28:06	Loved how calm @fymaxwell was during tribal. Just sitting back watching... #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 05:28:55	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds you did not! You're just like So and Joaquin! Liars.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 05:29:17	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds plus the pun was "So" went home... ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 05:30:20	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Lol. Exactly.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 05:31:10	@mrsredsox0923 me too. I'm pissed :(
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 05:34:27	@robstaboobuzzer @JeffProbst my guess is no. You could always ask your buddy.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 05:36:56	@meehand what if we got cut right before finals? Still worth trying? Or has casting made up their mind?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 16:32:26	@truedorktimes @JeffProbst where is this rumor coming from? It is a real possibility? Definitely no bueno.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-26 17:19:22	@JeffProbst Just read your @DaltonRoss article. Sorry Jeff, white collar it is. But, hey, that's exactly how I felt too...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-28 02:50:06	We have to go to the #Survivor exhibit at The Paley Center. We can play with the challenges! @GirlPakProds @dexterleekim
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-28 04:31:35	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim you know you want to. Btw, it's free through May :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-02-28 06:19:49	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Half body hug?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-01 02:48:32	@fymaxwell @Janglim21 best reference ever!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-01 03:44:45	@alliepohevitz Just heard your interview from this week on the new cast. Love hearing casting insights :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-01 16:59:49	@RHAPfan21 it's a human condition for some :( Here's to a great March!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-01 20:53:12	LA is absolutely gorgeous after it rains.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-05 04:15:44	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I know! I'd be much more concerned about my bottom area!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-05 04:16:51	Why go nude on the bottom and not the top? #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-05 04:25:24	@ReneJHerrera wonder how long my hug will be?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-05 04:37:45	Love that any tribe can win these challenges at either time. And Dan backed his words up! #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-05 04:38:32	@ReneJHerrera I was just thinking if I ever play I really need to learn how to.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-05 04:42:54	@ReneJHerrera it just may not look pretty.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-05 04:44:13	@ReneJHerrera I can swim. Grew up sailing and by the beach. My dive just isn't the most beautiful thing you've seen. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-05 04:47:18	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim It really is. Like how the f' did it come back to my people?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-05 04:50:45	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim it's looking bad for ChokingCollars. Unless it's ShockCollar.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-05 04:57:47	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim @robcesternino he actually does come across as coherent and sound at times.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-05 05:21:01	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds and it was one ShockCollar voting out another!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-04 22:01:40	@jerrimanthey so you saying you'd play again? :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-05 00:22:44	@So_Kim @Joaqsworld Welcome to my world. West coast. At least we have sun :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-05 16:02:33	@RHAPfan21 I like it :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-05 20:59:57	@gordonholmes Great interview. Allows us to see Vince in a way we didn't on TV.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-06 17:14:26	@FindMyNervous sometimes I call texts, tweets
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-04 01:01:46	@TheEllenShow @JaredLeto I've been waiting for this moment ever since Jordan Catalano :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-07 16:34:29	@Lyndzzz awesome. What's hens night?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-07 18:57:55	@robstaboobuzzer @robcesternino Good reminder to vote #RHAP. Done :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-07 20:13:30	@Lyndzzz Aha. Bachelorette party here!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-08 03:49:15	@RHAPfan21 it gets better as it goes along too.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-08 05:42:21	@ReneJHerrera @RHAPfan21 REN don't spoil him. He just started watching season 1 ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-08 17:53:17	@ReneJHerrera lmfao!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-09 02:25:07	As always, do not cross Carol. Toughest woman on TV. #TheWalkingDead
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-09 02:25:59	@truedorktimes any idea when the finale will be?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-09 22:37:25	Love the song Teenage Talk by St. Vincent premiered on @lenadunham Girls. Awesome music on the show.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-09 23:47:15	@ReneJHerrera what'd she say? Is it really a big deal?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-10 02:15:56	@ReneJHerrera is she just a troll?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-10 19:19:48	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera Hey Bros, enjoy NYC #RHAP tomorrow! Will be jealous ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-09 21:43:30	Half way through the #RHAP podcast with @KassMcQ. Hilarious and right on point. @robcesternino
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-11 17:10:34	@ReneJHerrera you sang. You drank. You got naked. You passed out.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-11 21:09:43	@ReneJHerrera You're staying til Fri? What's on the agenda?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-11 21:14:17	@robstaboobuzzer how long are you staying in NYC?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-11 21:17:46	@fymaxwell @ReneJHerrera Especially with the play by plays. But hey, in 2 months plenty of partying to be had here in LA :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-12 03:30:09	@robstaboobuzzer agree, but I'm sure production encourages it
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-12 03:32:04	No way this cast is as chummy as they appear to be in recent pics etc.  #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-12 03:32:50	Cool. Calm. Collective. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-12 03:47:57	Will calling Nina deadweight is BS! Maybe he needs to look in the mirror. Winded half way through the challenge. Ugh. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-12 03:59:02	@NinaPoersch Love your exit interview. Sorry to see you go.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-12 04:01:00	@fymaxwell Purple Max? Lol. I kid...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-12 04:01:59	@RedmondSurvivor Really? Seems it's on par to me.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-12 04:27:14	@truedorktimes We also learned how much they hate (or annoy) each other. Wouldn't know it from seeing them all chummy together.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-12 03:41:34	No Collars strategy at tribal? Did they figure they have to go against the grain in everything they do? Less doesn't equal more. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-12 16:16:26	@robcesternino @stephenfishbach It sounds like it was an amazing time. Sorry to have missed it :(
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-12 15:56:34	@RHAPfan21 a less intelligent and socially aware version.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-12 23:49:26	@mrsredsox0923 @robstaboobuzzer @DeMarcoMurray I'm pissed my team couldn't get him.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-14 04:57:08	@UTgehlken Any idea why Royal didn't want to stay? Concerning to me.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-13 04:27:34	@ReneJHerrera You survive my bro?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-13 04:31:01	@ReneJHerrera not a youngin anymore, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-13 04:35:09	@ReneJHerrera Oh must've hurt letting Rob buy you shots, lol. You could've said no ;) Sounds like fun. Take some aspirin.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-13 04:35:33	@ReneJHerrera Does this mean you're gonna wuss out of Dirty30?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-13 04:38:08	@ReneJHerrera Haha. Gotta do what you gotta do!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-13 05:24:52	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim WoeToYe should be my new tribe name.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-15 00:02:39	@FindMyNervous she knows what's up. Btw, how you liking Sunny this season? I feel like they're caricatures of themselves at times.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-15 00:06:09	@FindMyNervous Yeah, it's a bummer. Recycling over and over. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-13 19:01:01	@Hayden_Moss I relate. Fortunately I got hooked on trivia crack lately so I haven't played CC in months. I feel free! ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-15 20:38:24	@RedmondSurvivor what types of girls were they looking for?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-15 21:41:07	@UTgehlken are they all bolting cause they don't want to play for the Chargers or is TT cleaning house? Prob is, we have no players.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-15 22:39:27	@FindMyNervous Have you been keeping up with The Jinx?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-15 22:42:04	@FindMyNervous Tonight's the finale. And when you get a chance, google Robert Durst.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-13 21:58:39	@robstaboobuzzer @mrsredsox0923 just say no.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-16 17:32:22	@realityblurred the interview on abc was confusing regarding when the audio "confession" happened. Made me wonder if events out of order
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-15 22:42:57	@FindMyNervous That is if you're caught up
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-16 02:59:01	@DaltonRoss Although it was obvious, it still stuns me and almost makes me sick. How can he be so careless after all this time? Wow.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-16 03:00:26	@FindMyNervous it's insane. Don't even know what to say.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-16 04:23:51	@FindMyNervous I know. Never seen anything like it!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-15 16:42:47	@robstaboobuzzer did you really just start this show?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-15 19:26:25	@realityblurred Makes you wonder why he agreed to do the documentary? Hubris?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-17 04:03:48	@UTKevinAcee @UTgehlken Geez. Why are we having such trouble signing a WR? Very disconcerting.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-17 15:35:39	@UTgehlken Really? Over the Pats? Great news!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-17 16:48:11	@realityblurred @annehelen Common editing for doc filmmakers. Nothing out of the ordinary. I just wonder when Durst really said the BR talk
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-19 03:16:59	Shirin running with Max in tow is f'ing hilarious. #SurvivorWorldsApart
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-19 03:54:39	Rodney. I have no words. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-19 03:56:07	@ReneJHerrera He's sure no Tony. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-19 04:27:35	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Bros over Hos
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-19 04:33:03	Dan is an authority on women and apologies. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-19 04:40:19	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim could be my guy. They showed him saying he's happy to go to tribal.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-19 04:59:04	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds she only lost one. #ChokingCollar lost one. But I'm ok with it
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-19 04:59:22	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds and you still have all 6?!?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-19 05:03:55	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds I only lost one person tonight. I didn't pick Lindsey. You've lost it
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-19 05:06:07	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds Choking Collar is still in good shape.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-19 05:07:14	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds No. It was clear that wasn't going to pan out. 1st pick is arbitrary anyway.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-19 05:13:35	@fymaxwell I think if someone's watched every season, they're a fan.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-19 05:28:29	@DakotaZulu @fymaxwell what about fans who watch once, but apply, and talk on forums etc? Varying degrees..,
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-19 05:33:16	@fymaxwell you may not have made the merge, but congrats for pursuing your dream!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-20 04:01:20	@RedmondSurvivor @fymaxwell finally someone agrees with me.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-21 05:38:20	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim @robcesternino ha. Need to listen.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-23 02:58:22	@DaltonRoss @EW Too far. Shouldn't have pulled the gun. Too aggressive for living within the walls. #middleground
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-23 05:10:30	@lenadunham love how you're character didn't go back to Adam. I like him, but shows maturity.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-23 18:22:45	@RedmondSurvivor out of a selection they give America?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-23 18:54:31	@UTgehlken best news ever!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-25 03:22:38	@SarahRiceMTV So very happy for you. A well earned win. At last! #TheChallengeBattleOfTheExes2
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-24 15:13:17	@Lyndzzz you'd know if it was annoying everyone though.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-24 17:58:32	@robstaboobuzzer I've heard it's great and definitely family friendly.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-25 15:29:15	@SurvivorShow @goofygal1171 Are you on this week?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-25 15:45:02	@goofygal1171 @SurvivorShow Hehe. Whatever it takes ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-24 16:12:54	@truedorktimes Hey. Any idea where Andy went on Twitter? Baby crying he wrote too much? Or an island far away?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 04:23:59	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds yet you say 4 of your 6 have no chance. #dotdothmmm
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 04:30:25	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim We still remember you're there. Don't think we don't have our voodoo dolls out.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 04:31:02	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds I was actually worried about those eggs that were laid.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 04:31:37	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Teah. And Dan.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 04:34:21	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim seriously just laughed out loud.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 04:37:50	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds he's writing a book akin to BR Rules.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 15:02:19	@goofygal1171 Oh boy. That will do it.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 03:01:37	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim previously on survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 03:18:20	Who said the women + Will couldn't win? #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 03:26:12	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim haha. I noticed that too.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 03:31:32	Ugh. Insanity is doing the same thing expecting different results. Throwing challenges are no bueno. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 03:38:29	Damn I've never seen anything like this. Mike spelling it out for Kelly. Most blatant ever? Still shaking my head. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 03:55:36	Maybe not a walk in the park Rodney and Joaquin. How'd throwing that challenge go for you? #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 03:56:07	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim exactly. Biggest tool out there.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 03:57:39	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds thoroughly enjoyed it even if it cost me.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 04:05:23	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim center part?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 04:07:57	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds so there's 12 left. And you have 50%. If you lose, will it be the biggest choke of all time?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 04:13:53	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds are you already trying to spin it? It's yours for the taking. Unless #chokingcollars, chokes you.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-26 20:11:12	The screaming child behind me on the plane is gonna kill me. Got 4+ hours of this.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-27 18:52:22	@robstaboobuzzer what's the diff in your opinion?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-03-27 18:54:47	@robstaboobuzzer ah yes. I hear ya.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 03:25:11	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim worst is why didn't anyone challenge that name?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 03:38:46	Too bad. Carolyn gave Joe a run for his money. Again, who said "old" people can't compete? #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 03:48:42	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim how is it that Collar me Maybe is still not a target?!?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 03:57:13	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim and how is he so pretty?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 04:01:10	Ah bummer @remington231 went home. The tribe swap seemed to screwup her game after all. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 04:01:36	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I still say they're worse for letting him.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 04:04:20	The tribe name #Merica was actually an April fools joke. Next week we'll see their real name. #Murica #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 04:09:59	@goofygal1171 @Lyndzzz "Wild" is overrated.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 04:14:09	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds Collar Me Maybe is getting cocky. You know what happens when that happens...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 04:26:02	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Carolyn does kick butt! I just learned a few days ago she does the tough mudder. It certainly shows.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 04:26:23	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds and so will the voters :/
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 04:29:33	@KassMcQ @SpencerBGM and the games begin...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 04:31:40	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I had no idea and didn't know the comparisons. I only watched the vids. But she's kept the edginess in control.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 04:32:22	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds they don't show much of his thinking.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 05:28:28	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim vision exercise is just as important.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 00:17:37	@RedmondSurvivor Ha. That was brilliant.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 03:01:48	@fymaxwell no idea. But absolutely adorable.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-04 04:34:42	@robstaboobuzzer already forgotten before we ever knew em
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-04 04:38:08	@ReneJHerrera @salomey5 how many block you Ren? It's gotta be in the 100s now right? And I love Kelly Wigglesworth being included.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-04 04:41:57	@ReneJHerrera @salomey5 what about others? Early doesn't block you?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-04 04:44:10	@ReneJHerrera @salomey5 lol. Who is PeppermintFatty?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-04 04:45:10	@ReneJHerrera @salomey5 No one messes with my bro. Just me and Rachel. And maybe Dana and Buzzer.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 21:26:45	@RedmondSurvivor would love if Kelly played again!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-02 21:27:45	@RedmondSurvivor problem is #Merica will probably screw it up.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 19:28:21	@DakotaZulu @RHAPfan21 What about Vince Sly?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 19:28:41	@salomey5 wow. Congrats.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 19:30:55	@DakotaZulu @RHAPfan21 Lol. Same can be said about Max from the viewers point of view that don't know anything about him.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 15:49:10	@RHAPfan21 no thanks.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 15:54:22	@DakotaZulu @RHAPfan21 You think? Hopefully Merica votes for players... Not just drama.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 15:57:17	@DakotaZulu @RHAPfan21 she was still responsible for her actions and reactions.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 15:58:03	@RHAPfan21 @DakotaZulu Ha. How'd that work out for you?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 15:59:30	@RHAPfan21 @DakotaZulu I didn't say 'real' whatever that is. But virtually giving up when things are bad is antithesis of 'player'
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 16:00:07	@RHAPfan21 @DakotaZulu ps I don't actually dislike her, I just don't need to see her play again. Or Angie for that matter
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 16:01:01	@RHAPfan21 @DakotaZulu Lol. See last tweet about Angie. But I still think there are 10 better options that J'Tia
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 16:01:32	@DakotaZulu @RHAPfan21 Eh. Not sure. Her flaw was more about the character that came out in the game.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 16:02:50	@RHAPfan21 @DakotaZulu which brings us full circle to Drama. Which is why Merica may vote for her.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 16:04:44	@RHAPfan21 @DakotaZulu Would you be sad if you can't vote?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 16:08:33	@DakotaZulu @RHAPfan21 yeah I hope it's that way actually. Really makes you have to choose your favs
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 16:10:50	@RHAPfan21 @DakotaZulu that would also be prudent.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 16:23:55	@DakotaZulu @RHAPfan21 unfortunately that's probably true.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-05 16:45:28	@DakotaZulu @RHAPfan21 Curious why Max? If one is a "casual" he didn't seem to impact the game and went out early. I could see the others
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-04 20:48:28	@TheGymAtHayden is the gym open tomorrow (Easter)?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-06 01:55:54	@GirlPakProds and why would you say that?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-06 01:59:39	@GirlPakProds were you singing along?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-06 20:29:22	@deitz_terry welcome to Twitter. Now you have to actually tweet ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-06 20:32:52	@deitz_terry You're a Charger fan? Awesome! It's a tough job, but someone has to do it :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-06 20:47:32	@FindMyNervous Hey, have you watched the Shameless finale?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-06 21:14:11	@FindMyNervous Yeah. How'd you like the season?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-06 21:29:29	@FindMyNervous Yeah I saw a lot of complaints too, but enjoyed it too. Those scenes with Monica were so unnerving in a good way.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-07 00:06:41	@Lyndzzz that means you had a great break!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-07 00:10:25	@salomey5 I have to admit all this Twitter hoopla from past Survivors is kinda fun.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:03:05	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim gotta do whatever it takes Deb
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:13:11	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim he wouldn't have to choose who to go with on reward.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:16:20	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim he really is. And Rodney keeps it real.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:16:49	I'm just keepin' it real like Rodney. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-10 16:27:58	My take on @theshirin is living with her may get old, but she'd be awesome to have a beer and hang with. She's hilarious. #Merica #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-10 16:29:45	And frankly living with most of us 24/7 while starving and cutting each other's throats would get old. #survivor  @theshirin
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:29:55	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Dan's just trying to be nice.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:31:27	Dan's just trying be nice with knives and daggers. #Survivor #NoSocialSkills
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:31:41	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim LMFAO!!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:32:15	@thereedkelly @Survivor_Tweet @bigwesnale at least someone talked him out of it.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:40:54	Omg. Dan twice thinks he has it. Wrong. Joe wins again! #Karma #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:41:20	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds that was the best example of karma ever. Or something. Oh and Joe is dreamy.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:41:42	Did I mention Joe is dreamy? #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:55:50	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds this is unprecedented. Does Collar me Maybe get a bonus lunch if he has all players at the end? F'ing rigged
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:56:16	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim :( That one is kinda a bummer.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:58:12	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim yeah it really I remarkable that it's gone on this long.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:59:12	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds if Jen quits next week I'm gonna have to slap someone.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 03:59:42	@ReneJHerrera I forget he's even there. We hear nothing about his game.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-09 04:17:39	@KassMcQ @truedorktimes We are in the look at me generation. I mean they invented a selfie stick. Wtf.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-11 04:49:14	@robcesternino @Zadck3 This is really bothering you? That's actually kinda cute. I give you a 5 for not just sitting there like a log.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-11 20:50:58	@robstaboobuzzer seems ok so far
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-11 20:53:08	@deitz_terry do you sail or are you with people who sail?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-13 02:20:33	@ReneJHerrera I've only watched the 1st half is season 1. Should I continue?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-13 02:29:29	@nofate1991 @ReneJHerrera Why does everyone love it so much?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-14 03:42:06	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Now I'm curious who didn't make the cut. Haha.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-15 02:52:45	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim how's your Twitter date?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 03:06:32	"I'm in the passenger seat backseat driving." -Shirin Better than in the trunk. Could work for a while. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 03:09:32	We haven't had good product placement in a while. At least is chocolate. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 03:12:34	I had no idea Survivor paired up with Wipe Out. Ouch. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 03:25:07	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim @robcesternino he was spot on!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 03:26:24	So I think all of #Merica is shocked at how spit on Rodney's impersonation of Mike is. Who knew? #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 03:35:48	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I forgot he was there.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 03:39:17	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds Who's Will?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 03:40:39	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim worried Jen is gonna sacrifice herself
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 03:43:20	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim ugh. She's killing me.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 03:54:21	Wow. Joe tried what he could. Would love to see him play again. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 03:54:56	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Sorry Joe left. But at least Deb and I are still 2 strong.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 04:21:33	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Ooohhh. Good point. All washed up and flowing.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 04:23:30	@GirlPakProds @robcesternino @dexterleekim Yes, please Rob. I'm certain us women (and probably some men) want to know. #dreamy
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 21:33:58	@ValCollins_ @jeremy2collins that looks like last nights Survivor episode...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 21:51:14	@robstaboobuzzer how old is he now?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 21:54:52	@robstaboobuzzer Ha. We're all getting old ;( But, yeah, 14 yr old boys = tough.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 21:58:18	@robstaboobuzzer Funny. Have you tried it yet? Curious his response.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 22:00:53	@robstaboobuzzer omg. Lol. Did he say anything?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 22:03:03	@robstaboobuzzer He must've thought you were crazy. Lol. Good news is around 16 it might get a little better ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 22:03:40	@robstaboobuzzer no "winning" now. But set up for later. But yeah, not really about "winning"
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 23:52:18	@meehand Love you Dawn. The underbelly of social media never changes, but you do :) üíö
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-16 23:54:41	@ReneJHerrera real hair or wig?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-17 00:01:00	@ReneJHerrera Ha! I can't decide if you were a punk (and not in a good way) or cool. Lol. ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-17 05:20:14	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim context?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-17 05:59:18	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim prob is she doesn't care. Hopefully that changes.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-17 06:01:46	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim that's true. They could all target her, but you're right, her vote is valuable.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-17 06:03:12	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim oh my. Just coughed as I was laughing.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-17 15:27:59	@JeffProbst have you missed it? At least you know people are passionate. Or just dumb.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-17 21:22:43	Love me some @Keenan13Allen And not just cause we share the same last name. #KA13 #Chargers
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-20 18:44:46	@fymaxwell Awesome cause it's totally unexpected and not lame like medallion of power v
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-20 18:45:22	@DaltonRoss @EW Wow. Can't wait to see how it plays out.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 03:05:15	Wow. Mixing it up in the auction out of the gate. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 03:09:21	Omg. Mike is a sneaky mf'er. Not sure how this is gonna turn out for him and whether he just blew any trust in the game. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 03:11:56	Still wishing washy doesn't seem like a great strategy. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 03:30:09	Damn, Will. Everybody's losing it. Not cool. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 03:32:40	Thing is Will's not really giving anything up cause he doesn't win challenges anyway. Sorry :( #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 03:33:53	Karma comes in the way of Shirin's hand going up. Ouch. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 03:34:32	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds Deb must not be watching right now. All I can say is holy shit.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 03:39:48	@alliepohevitz damn. Always want to hear you unfiltered.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 03:41:39	Popcorn out. Ready for tribal. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 03:58:43	@dexterleekim I think I'm in a bad spot for the rest of the season.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 04:02:13	@dexterleekim they did? Then why did it look like Mike thought there was a chance?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 04:05:30	@theshirin @jenncantdance @hali_ford @sierra_dawn_ @ucantdothat121 yeah there was a lot of gross behavior.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 05:41:24	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim yeah, #ChokingCollars has one hope left in one who's choking his game away.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 05:42:27	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim and Will.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 05:47:05	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Ha. I wonder if Kenwood's ears are burning right now?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 05:48:27	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I can relate to that actually. Not naming names ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 05:48:50	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds Yep. My empathy went her way.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 05:49:20	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim F'ing hilarious. Some parallel universe.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 05:51:34	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim it's clear she's unliked out there, but still doesn't need to get that personal.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 05:52:57	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Will was a seal. Now he's a bear. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 05:57:03	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I think you're just biased cause he's on #ShockCollar ;) Or maybe I'm biased cause we haven't seen much of him
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 05:57:52	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim yeah he wasn't lying so I understand his anger there.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 05:58:47	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim socially tone deaf people is more than half this cast. Guess that's why it's been a weird season
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 05:59:43	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds you have to admit his willingness to give up a chance for immunity was funny though. No way he wins.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 06:01:05	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim damn, who's Tracy Flickian? Yes, Deb watching Survivor is all game. Not real life. See you could play ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 06:03:51	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim the important thing here is #CollarMeMaybe still has majority with all his misfits. Rodney for the win.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 06:04:26	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Oh yeah. Old school reference.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 06:04:48	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim that would be amazing!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 06:07:00	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim yeah that was really weird actually. Also he's my only shot left so in a weird way I root for him. Biased.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 06:07:11	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds Tyler
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 06:07:45	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Mama C is still a strong contender.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 06:09:06	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim depends who she would sit with. But she does have people on the jury who dislike her.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 06:09:59	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Haha. Deb does it all the time with Ian and Chris in IT. That's how she's lasted so long
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 06:11:41	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim just not on Twitter about the cast.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 06:12:02	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Still love it.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 06:12:58	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds well she said nice things according to her tactic.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 06:15:15	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim my favorite: probably a kind loudmouth
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 06:17:37	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Ok. Nice chat over Twitter. (forget texting) Going to sleep. I'll try not to have Survivormares
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 16:17:11	@meehand @fymaxwell @theshirin Ah. Nice. From someone who knows what it likes to need an adoptive mom, that warmed my heart.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 18:06:10	Look out. I'm coming for ya. http://t.co/POUgXacQcJ
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-23 22:21:03	@GirlPakProds @robcesternino @dexterleekim which behavior?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-24 20:36:33	@RHAPfan21 it's actually really good for a few seasons.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-26 03:56:31	@RHAPfan21 you're already there?!?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-26 05:34:46	@ReneJHerrera Take a walk outside. Breathe.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-26 15:32:40	@KassMcQ Congrats. Only one person has ever blocked me. And actually it was in relation to you. Hmmm. Pattern? Both act like a-holes.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-26 15:49:02	@RHAPfan21 it's hard to accept that some people will only be in our lives for a limited period of time and that there's still meaning there
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-26 15:56:17	@RHAPfan21 I'm not very good at it either so I understand the feeling. Does time help?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-26 16:00:34	@RHAPfan21 I send you a hug.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-25 03:59:26	Why does Shonda Rhimes insist on killing off all the main characters (minus Yang) who leave the show? Seriously that hospital is bad luck!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-24 15:41:09	@Lyndzzz I haven't watched the last Grey's yet (scared), but if you want a kick, start watching the first season etc on Netflix. So fun!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-28 02:50:28	@robcesternino I heard you had an MFT on. I could've done that! Maybe next time...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-28 04:56:47	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim for when?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-28 04:58:42	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim hmmm. Tyler gets screen time?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-28 05:03:05	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim never swen
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-28 05:05:13	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim yeah that's possible. Still can't believe I thought he had been taken :(
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-28 05:08:11	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds go to bed. You're sick.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-28 05:08:22	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim how many pages?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-26 21:41:09	@ReneJHerrera you get I any fights last night?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-26 23:33:36	@ReneJHerrera @nofate1991 um. What he say? Is it not proper for Twitter?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-27 00:33:29	@nofate1991 C'mon. You're expecting fans to be level headed? Wrong show. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-29 19:31:48	@RedmondSurvivor Riggins forever.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:38:21	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim btw, how totally unfair was that IC? Girls had 1/3 chance.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:40:17	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I seriously can't watch him anymore.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:49:17	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I thought she had several good points.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:56:50	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim not sure I like everyone in real like. Haha.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:58:53	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds but now my guy can use his two votes
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:54:32	Wow. Well it did show who was on the bottom. Crazy move Mike. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 16:07:32	@GirlPakProds @robcesternino True. I understand the hurt. Was he a dick? Yes. Was it "abuse" in the context of a reality show? Eh.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 16:09:10	@GirlPakProds @robcesternino still think Dan comparing his being adopted was funny. That guy = insufferable.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 16:26:08	@RHAPfan21 define happiness
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 20:01:18	@iBenglish hey. Let me know if you didn't receive my DM back to you. Thx.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 15:25:39	@GirlPakProds @robcesternino interesting about bio.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 16:28:30	@RHAPfan21 ok. That's a lie. But happiness is definitely ever changing, not a constant. Sorry it seems you're having a bad moment :(
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 16:32:16	@RHAPfan21 yeah. But moments seem more manageable.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:06:07	@ReneJHerrera for one sec I thought he had a heart. Nope.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:23:30	Wonder how Dan feels when he's seeing how wrong he is? #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:24:28	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim @robcesternino right. No edit means, not so good. Except if you're on a terrible season #Natalie
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:24:36	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Dan drives me nuts.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:26:19	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim he would rival someone else who works at an unnamed entertainment labor union.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:29:07	Wow, the women got a lucky break. Bigger chance to win immunity. Not sure how that's ok at this stage in the game. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:34:41	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds Woohoo! Choking Collars still alive! And F' Dan.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:35:58	Mike wins! Dan sucks. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-01 03:25:44	@TBMWolverine @annieheilbrunn @Melvingordon25 can't help but be excited. Team is much better with a good RB
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:52:07	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds love it!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 03:59:38	@robstaboobuzzer not according to her confessional. She understood it b
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-01 05:29:12	@theshirin Hi read an interview that you were cut before finals and then later got a call for S30. Did you continue to send in vids between?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-01 06:15:23	@Lyndzzz I'm still pissed about Derek being killed off.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-01 06:21:30	@bill_weibel which part?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-01 15:19:25	@JeffProbst you were great confronting Dan on his parallel of adoption. Don't listen to the haters!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-01 15:20:01	@nofate1991 @JeffProbst did you get unblocked?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-01 15:21:36	@FindMyNervous I checked them out cause you tweet them so much :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-01 15:25:52	@FindMyNervous yeah! Found I let it just play.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 17:18:04	Interesting watching the @theshirin Ponderosa video. Good message there regardless of one's personal opinion. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 18:57:36	@RHAPfan21 hey. What are you doing right now?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-04-30 19:10:03	@iBenglish hi, can you DM me when you get a chance. Concerned about a friend of yours.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-02 21:07:32	@fymaxwell is it fun?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-03 00:12:59	@UTKevinAcee Definitely frustrating outside of the 1st pick. Will we find out what TT was thinking with the 3rd pick?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-04 00:34:48	@ReneJHerrera @nofate1991 should I know Ben Folds?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-03 02:25:27	@Celtic_Films are you on FB?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-03 02:28:15	@Celtic_Films if you're not of FB, follow me here so I can DM you
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-03 02:32:04	@Celtic_Films just sent you a private message on FB. Check your "other" folder
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-03 02:35:33	@Celtic_Films I also just requested you as friend on FB so if you accept you will see the private message
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-03 02:43:54	@Celtic_Films I did. I sent you a message. You have to check your other folder
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-03 02:46:28	@Celtic_Films ok. Just dm'd you
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-05 02:50:44	@ReneJHerrera at least he's a hot one.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-05 15:23:44	@FindMyNervous awesome! I've been looking forward to it.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 03:12:56	Totally shocked Will wasn't chosen to play in the reward challenge. School yard pickem. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 03:14:40	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim yep. And his 0.000 chance isn't a good sound bite for him
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 03:20:33	Birthdays don't matter on #Survivor. Cracks are starting to show.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 03:25:12	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim that's the first expression like that's from mama c I've seen all season
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 03:30:18	If they were smart they'd get out Tyler right now. He's always thinking and the true cool, calm and collective. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 03:35:27	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim that's what people were wondering last time. Must be tattoo?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 03:40:12	This was Mama C's to lose. She's a beast. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 03:40:22	@DaltonRoss always Will
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 03:54:11	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim I know. Editing has been a little weird.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 03:55:12	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds that's a big kbe
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 03:55:38	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim So let the game begin.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 03:57:00	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim the announcement was kinda flat. But gotta vote!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 03:57:26	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Ahem. #ChokingCollard
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 03:57:46	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim God. My tweets are full of typos
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 03:58:31	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim hehe. Love it.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 04:03:38	@SpencerBGM you know I'm voting for you and @KassMcQ
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 04:05:54	@kellywigles excited you're on the ballot! Will definitely be voting your way.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-05 19:49:15	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Look for Survivor announcement tomorrow during or after airing.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 04:09:16	@deitz_terry will do! Btw how do you like the Chargers draft? Kinda weird...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 04:37:43	@truedorktimes yeah. It's a fairly narrow window. And the. Who know if it will really reflect our votes.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 05:52:03	@KassMcQ @KikiFabo I feel like you are meta trolling. Trolling about trolling. Or just a troll? You should be on Community. :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 05:52:40	@TheWesRogers yes the game has (un)officially begun.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 05:58:08	@KassMcQ @KikiFabo Are you being sarcastic about your sarcasm? ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 05:59:14	@KassMcQ @KikiFabo Side note, if you haven't watched Community, there are some brilliant seasons. If you like a self referential show.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-06 16:40:11	@ReneJHerrera @SpencerBGM and here it begins...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-06 23:22:17	@ReneJHerrera what's the asterisks?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 15:23:28	@JeffProbst they'll always find a way to complain! This is gonna be fun...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-08 02:47:31	@JEFFVARNER your campaign vid sold me! #Survivor #SecondChance
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-08 02:48:15	@Lyndzzz uh oh. What happened?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-08 02:50:01	@kellywigles Really hope to see get on!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 18:32:26	@nofate1991 you trolling?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 18:36:39	@nofate1991 how come?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 18:43:03	@nofate1991 @ReneJHerrera that's weird. Maybe she's a tad too sensitive. If she's gonna play again needs a thicker skin
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-08 05:25:32	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim why aren't you able to? Is it your browser or something else?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-08 05:29:10	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim ugh. Can you try a diff browser?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-08 05:29:35	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim @Stephen exactly. How else am I gonna get on?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-07 21:43:18	My Twitter feed is eerily like a high school election. #Survivor #SecondChance
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-08 20:51:21	@ReneJHerrera I was waiting for someone to say that
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-08 20:53:44	@DaltonRoss @EW I knew it was a legal thing. Me smart ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-09 03:15:43	@KassMcQ does your dog get to go with you too? What a cutie.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-09 03:18:08	@RHAPfan21 my bday is later Oct and I felt the same way. It especially sucked when they were able to drink legally.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-09 04:53:43	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Spit. My selections haven't been the exact same either.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-09 18:18:40	@ReneJHerrera @AshsDreamboard he must be one of the few that isn't?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-08 15:38:53	@DaltonRoss It's very possible. Their web crew over there makes mistakes all the time. Or the copy people. Sloppy. Sorry CBS
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-08 15:40:00	@stephenfishbach I'll Ouse them. Glad you have a shot
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-09 18:20:50	@fymaxwell call me too.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-09 18:23:03	My biggest concern is old timers won't get on cause majority of voters don't tweet about Survivor. Boo recency bias. #SurvivorSecondChance
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-09 18:23:51	@fymaxwell these texts are actually funny. Where was this humor out there?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-09 21:55:14	Apparently I need to listen to @JEFFVARNER on #RHAP.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-09 22:19:37	@JEFFVARNER :) I've been voting for you each day.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 21:48:53	@ReneJHerrera so wtf is periscope?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 21:52:19	@ReneJHerrera interesting. All this shit to keep up with.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 21:52:53	@ReneJHerrera that's typical Shane yes? Which is why he'll make good tv
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 22:05:21	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera that's the prob. Who's available while they're live?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 22:06:37	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera and some of us have lives
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 22:10:36	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera I guess that just makes you a casual fan. ;) lol. Blah.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 23:00:39	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera didn't see it. Did you?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 23:05:35	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera that's why we need him on I suppose :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 23:09:39	@teetomterrific her art is so amazing.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 23:12:30	@RedmondSurvivor seriously? I want him on, but does he not learn?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 23:13:33	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera rather than all 10?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 23:15:01	@RedmondSurvivor Agree. There can be drama without the darkness. Best of both worlds.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 23:15:51	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera yeah, me too. Maybe they set it up to guarantee the others will get votes. Or too balance out recent bias?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 23:18:08	@salomey5 @RedmondSurvivor Huh. No way Tony was dark. The shit coming out of some S30 cast is dark. Tony was fun and seems like a good guy.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 23:18:44	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera That would be too easy wouldn't it?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-09 23:42:08	Whether you love her or love to hate her, gotta vote for @KassMcQ. Will she play nice? Or is she forever #ChaosKass? #SurvivorSecondChance
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-09 23:43:41	@BriceIzyah @fymaxwell @stephenfishbach hobos have cellphones these days ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-11 17:27:47	@Hawk_941 @nofate1991 @AriFerarri it does take up a lot of ones life for sure though. Just even with all the airing and possible backlash.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 02:28:38	@DjFluker76 There's always going to be ignorant people and assholes. Sorry you went through that.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-11 18:23:35	@Theshanepowers one more reason to vote for you.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-11 18:26:43	@KassMcQ @SurvivorOz well everyone thought you'd be first boost first time around. Look how that turned out.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-11 00:01:22	@ReneJHerrera @salomey5 I do want people out there though who are willing to play hard.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-11 00:02:39	@ReneJHerrera @pquaife Is Mama C campaigning?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-11 00:05:56	@salomey5 @ReneJHerrera I hope, but not knowing they have to or would even want to seems concerning. They both still have my vote, but...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-11 21:45:09	@UTKevinAcee @ESPNNFL don't you think then that their championship should be forfeited? What's the pt if not?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-11 23:13:21	@ReneJHerrera too much time on your hands?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-11 23:16:08	@ReneJHerrera haha. Never brother. Never.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-11 04:12:14	@KassMcQ @Janglim21 Very sweet. One of the most likable from S30.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-10 20:25:26	@TinaWesson Read your article re grief &amp; Moms Day. Thx for sharing your process, hope and the fact we can't think our way through grief. ‚ù§Ô∏è
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-12 15:26:37	@CORINSANITY @RHAPfan21 sounds common for casting who drop players at the last minute. At least this cruelty is transparent. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-12 15:27:26	@robstaboobuzzer it'll be marked as the downfall of something.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 03:04:06	This big monologue from Dan means he has to go home, right? Please. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 03:15:07	Has Jeff ever given out so many clues in any challenge? Wow. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 03:19:55	@ReneJHerrera back in innocent yimss
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 03:25:23	So Dan just spontaneously finds fruit that they didn't know was there before? Dot dot hmmm... #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 03:25:44	@FiligirlFu I'm sure he was dying out there.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 03:27:26	@ReneJHerrera yay for the emoticon.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 03:37:09	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim Whew. #ChokingCollars
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 03:37:59	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds like the 4th of july
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 03:54:44	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim woohoo!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 03:56:32	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds how did Deb and I become the power players left this season?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 04:00:36	Would @MamaC_14 have played her idol if Dan hadn't used his advantage? Karma baby. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 04:05:47	@truedorktimes God CBS sucks
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 04:10:38	@SurvivorPenner Ahem. When's my invite? All the cool kids watch from your spread.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 04:12:39	@truedorktimes still CBS yes? Either way I hate that's happened a lot more in the last couple of years.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 04:39:14	@ChadKincaid1 then stop drinking
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 04:39:44	@ChadKincaid1 oh ok ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 18:05:18	@TheWesRogers @JeffProbst funny I was gonna ask something similar.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 19:48:47	@gordonholmes bummer that he really doesn't get it. Maybe in time.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 19:49:17	@ReneJHerrera in a good way?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 19:58:04	@ReneJHerrera yeah I read some interviews. Doesn't seem to get it.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 21:31:15	@robcesternino @roundhoward @fymaxwell Easy. Kale chips. Yummy.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-14 21:58:34	So was the big happy family of S30 #Survivor cast a farce from the beginning or just when the show started to air?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-16 05:25:14	@JeffProbst Lol. I love you when you're snarky.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-15 23:59:02	@ChadKincaid1 what type of hate? Calling him unaware and delusional or something else?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-15 23:59:51	@KassMcQ I guess the hate came later?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-16 00:05:19	@ChadKincaid1 well he did give them a lot to work with, lol. I think people would a give him a break if he owned his stuff more.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-16 00:38:40	@Theshanepowers it's a clusterfuck isn't it?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-16 16:17:42	I'll throw a vote someone's way if they promise to name their tribe #Merica #SurvivorSecondChance
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-16 18:29:16	Maybe @KassMcQ can teach Dan (and possibly others) a course on How to turn your Haters into Lovers. #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-17 01:54:57	@Theshanepowers not baggin, but curious why you hate her so much?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-17 05:21:01	@Hawk_941 she has swayed a lot of voters on some of the survivor groups.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-17 05:26:15	@Hawk_941 she's just interacting with them and they're probably seeing a different side to her.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-17 06:00:25	@Hawk_941 yeah but they continue to say idiotic things, lol
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-17 22:49:39	@GetOnSurvivor I agree with a lot of what you wrote, but I don't think Spencer grew out there. I think he used a persona to get cast...
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-17 21:14:39	@ReneJHerrera @nofate1991 ouch
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-17 22:50:36	@FindMyNervous happy happy bday :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-17 23:58:46	@GetOnSurvivor I can see that. I always wondered what it would've been like for him if they hadn't kept losing.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-18 00:18:34	@DaltonRoss Damn spoiler! ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-18 03:25:13	@ReneJHerrera chills
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-18 03:30:29	Goodbye to a great series and beautiful ending. Perfect. #MadMen
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-18 23:10:01	@truedorktimes @realityblurred maybe the "casuals" are voting more than once?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-19 00:06:06	@ReneJHerrera @salomey5 @LauraJHolz and me! :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-18 21:56:27	@KassMcQ @realityblurred I still think you make it on cause the casuals will ignore the old schoolers.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-19 01:42:19	@Theshanepowers I think the casuals will remember you over many of the other choices. I really hope. So still a chance.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-20 02:01:24	@ReneJHerrera nerd
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-20 02:03:28	@JEFFVARNER good luck!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-20 03:17:52	@deitz_terry Hope you make it on!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-20 20:08:12	@robstaboobuzzer @JeffProbst not the right order
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-20 21:57:01	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim that sucks!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-20 23:04:33	@RedmondSurvivor no spoilers though right?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-20 23:15:30	@RedmondSurvivor yeah that's what I meant :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-20 23:24:39	Showtime starts soon and I will be on lockdown til 8pm. No phone. Just like the 2nd chancers. Except, really nothing like that.  #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-20 23:27:45	@robstaboobuzzer I cannot wait. You have to come out next season finale. We need a redo.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 03:43:24	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim #chokingcollars still in it :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 03:56:57	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds why not mama C? Cause Mike is loyal.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 03:58:50	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds yeah I don't know why he promised not to write her name down
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 04:09:14	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim #ChokingCollar final 3
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 04:35:31	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds Yikes. Worst loss ever in the history of survivor fantasy. Sorry :(
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 04:58:28	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds nervousing. Not sure about this.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 04:59:12	@robcesternino maybe they cut them out cause they were less interesting than the jury?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 05:06:23	Shocker Cochran is at the finale again. #SurvivorFinale
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 05:07:37	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds woohoo!!!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 05:09:46	Yes we knew for weeks Mike won cause of the edit, but damn he earned it. Congratulations. #SurvivorFinale
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 05:10:06	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds rode that horse for weeks!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 05:11:43	@dexterleekim @GirlPakProds it must've been the tribe name
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-20 15:09:02	Today is one of the only days it sucks to live on the west coast. #SurvivorFinale #SurvivorSecondChance
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 05:16:29	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim oh no. You shouldn't have done that :(
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 05:19:23	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim we still haven't found out about next seadon
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 05:19:47	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim when's lunch :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 05:21:02	I won fantasy football this year and fantasy Survivor. Maybe I should play the lottery.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 05:21:51	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim no charger?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 05:25:08	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim either.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 05:28:09	Jeff is not letting Dan off the hook. Wow. #SurvivorFinale
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 05:34:57	You criticize the show, Jeff will come out with the big guns. Raw footage. Almost as compelling as The Jinx. #SurvivorFinale #LoveIt
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 05:55:25	Rough night for Mama C. #SurvivorFinale
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 05:57:25	America fucked up not voting @Theshanepowers in. #SurvivorSecondChance
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 06:01:26	@Theshanepowers really shocked. Biggest disappointment of the night.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 06:12:15	@SurvivorPenner it's brutal.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 06:14:49	@Theshanepowers I don't blame you. Gut wrenching. Sorry you had to go through that.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-20 18:23:07	@robcesternino you going to the after party tonight?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 15:42:10	@JeffProbst that was rough. Dreamt about you and survivor last night. So sad I haven't gotten to play. Ugh.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 15:47:33	@nofate1991 hehe. Not the first time. Probably not the last.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 15:48:03	@nofate1991 don't you?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 17:17:23	@fymaxwell @idkmybffBrian it's gotta be rough this morning. You holding up?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 19:28:11	@ReneJHerrera @RedmondSurvivor Ugh. Insufferable. Prediction: he won't be as successful as Hayden.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 19:37:21	@ReneJHerrera @RedmondSurvivor exactly. He's gonna be terrible. And most likely delusional. Lol.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 20:40:34	@jamesloganrice @JeffProbst sorry it didn't work out. I saw how badly you wanted it and voted for you there on out.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 21:45:29	@salomey5 funny. I feel like any time I tweet about something non survivor related I lose a follower or more.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 21:46:55	@Lyndzzz can't imagine you would say anything harsh enough to be defriended
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 21:51:53	@salomey5 yeah probably. I don't even have my normal friends on Twitter. They're on FB.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 23:01:43	@Theshanepowers I guess I was delusional about it too.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-22 04:26:06	@FiligirlFu @Theshanepowers I'm itching more now to play than before!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 23:35:33	@ReneJHerrera you a bit retweet happy right now?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-21 23:38:57	@ReneJHerrera by your alter ego?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-22 00:01:19	@ReneJHerrera uh oh. Lol. I'll play nice brother :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-24 00:26:31	@fymaxwell @iqbalsiregar what was she snitching about? Though I guess you can't say.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-22 16:48:28	@RHAPfan21 stop that
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-22 23:21:07	@TBMWolverine @RedmondSurvivor they did film it. It was originally 31, so they will air out of order
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-22 23:24:03	@TBMWolverine @RedmondSurvivor yeah that sux for thrn
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-24 16:19:29	@robstaboobuzzer enjoy your day buzzer
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-24 16:19:52	@mrsredsox0923 @RHAPfan21 Sandi that's exactly what I was thinking!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-24 21:00:47	@ReneJHerrera @danacomiskey are you at another wedding? You're the Wedding Crasher.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-25 15:24:53	@RHAPfan21 do you know what you'll get?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-28 02:47:00	@Lyndzzz yeah I binge watched that show a while ago :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-28 17:11:13	@RedmondSurvivor that's a long time to not being allowed to talk to one another. Assuming that's the case.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-28 20:12:09	@GirlPakProds @robcesternino what podcast was it? And Dex and I decided our League name should be Boo Hoo, Go Home. @dexterleekim
36507049	kqueen123	2015-05-29 05:22:20	@Lyndzzz I would ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-02 21:13:42	@jerrimanthey thank you for posting on YouTube!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-04 18:52:53	@jerrimanthey Great tips for application vids. I like what you said about showing what you're passionate about in ones life, not Survivor.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-04 15:04:36	@FindMyNervous it must be preparing you for BB
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-05 22:01:20	@GirlPakProds @dexterleekim So I guess our league name should be called #RedWhite&amp;BooHoo? Who wants to create the logo? ;) #Survivor
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-04 16:50:03	@FindMyNervous Wow. You're skipping? How come?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-04 16:52:23	@FindMyNervous well that's "healthy" of you. Lol. Will you not watch at all or just not tweet about it?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-07 20:37:38	@robstaboobuzzer to where?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-08 02:51:22	@GirlPakProds @Rosagrazz @DevotionProj @dexterleekim making me hungry.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-12 01:43:46	@Lyndzzz @OITNB @TaySchilling omg! It's available here ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-12 01:44:33	@Lyndzzz @OITNB @TaySchilling woohoo!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-11 20:02:07	@RHAPfan21 @robstaboobuzzer what did I miss?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-11 20:03:12	@RHAPfan21 @robstaboobuzzer any good topics?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-11 23:23:55	@Lyndzzz @OITNB @TaySchilling I can't wait! But I have to til tomorrow.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-15 03:00:43	@teetomterrific killed me.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-15 03:03:59	GoT finale. Damn.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-15 04:07:31	"It's always 5 o'clock in prison." #OITNB
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-14 01:38:43	Orange is the New Black quoting Friday Night Lights! I adore you. :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-14 02:30:40	@Lyndzzz you're ahead of me. Only on episode 3
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-13 15:34:38	@robstaboobuzzer as long as you can still play scramble I'm cool with that ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-12 19:35:54	@meehand mmmm. That looks good.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-15 15:20:26	@robstaboobuzzer when's our friend come out of trolling? I suspect after cat reveal.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-15 15:21:24	@FindMyNervous love Nirvana's rendition of this.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-15 15:22:24	@robstaboobuzzer ha. Oops. Cat must be on the brain.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-15 15:55:16	@RHAPfan21 @ReneJHerrera I just want the ruse to be over cause I miss my bro. :(
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-15 15:57:14	@RHAPfan21 @ReneJHerrera It's called The Island of REN
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-15 22:39:08	@fymaxwell @ReneJHerrera agree. The troll is trolling. But he is disproving your theory that he can't keep a secret. hes been silent 4 days.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-15 22:42:44	@nofate1991 @fymaxwell @ReneJHerrera Ha. Truth will come tomorrow.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-17 01:57:12	Bummed for my bro @ReneJHerrera.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-17 01:29:42	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera miss my bro
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-17 14:59:31	@Lyndzzz I'm not there yet. Should I be worried?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-17 15:57:54	@RHAPfan21 You don't sound weird! Nice to hear your voice :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-17 17:45:08	@RHAPfan21 what did you talk about?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-18 17:28:59	@ChadKincaid1 calling what quits?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-18 17:33:59	@ChadKincaid1 what does that look like?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-17 19:57:53	@UTKevinAcee so are you saying the Chargers organization basically sucks at this point? Depressing.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-18 01:24:58	@FindMyNervous @ReneJHerrera Wow. Congrats!
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-18 01:26:06	@robstaboobuzzer @ReneJHerrera figured Buzzer would be on it.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-18 01:28:06	@ReneJHerrera @robstaboobuzzer that's like me peeing in a cup ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-17 23:04:34	@Lyndzzz how'd you like the season in general?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-17 23:09:18	@Lyndzzz still a good show though, right? Btw do you know if Wentworth is having a new season?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-18 03:27:31	#RodCocker LMFAO #OrangeIsTheNewBlack
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-17 23:19:29	@FindMyNervous is it fun?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-17 23:23:39	@FindMyNervous I'm addicted to Wordbubbles right now
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-19 00:09:12	@robstaboobuzzer @mrsredsox0923 definitely good for a while. And then you're sucked in ;)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-19 00:28:57	@mrsredsox0923 why not?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-19 00:30:12	@robstaboobuzzer @mrsredsox0923 Mad Men is awesome but very different show. But if you watch a couple of Mad Med you'll prob be hooked.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-19 00:30:42	@robstaboobuzzer @mrsredsox0923 Mad Men is a better show. But Sons is kinda of addicting too.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-19 00:34:21	@mrsredsox0923 yeah I get that.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-19 02:05:38	@Hawk_941 @robstaboobuzzer @mrsredsox0923 3 seasons? Why watch that long then?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-19 02:10:17	@Hawk_941 @robstaboobuzzer @mrsredsox0923 Have you watched Sons? Definitely bad people.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-19 02:15:17	@robstaboobuzzer @Hawk_941 @mrsredsox0923 both good choices :)
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-19 03:13:31	@ReneJHerrera @nofate1991 @robstaboobuzzer @roundhoward @AMikeBloomType @Hawk_941 @TheRealKBlack25 @josephcurrier what's Daredevil about?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-19 03:14:44	@ReneJHerrera ha. Serious question. Good?
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-19 03:49:51	@ReneJHerrera oh yeah. I've heard about it. Heard it was good.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-19 04:00:55	@ReneJHerrera Yeah foreign films and period pieces. Bleh.
36507049	kqueen123	2015-06-18 23:32:41	@mrsredsox0923 Orange is the new black
