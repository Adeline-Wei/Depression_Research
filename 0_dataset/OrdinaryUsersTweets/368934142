368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-13 03:42:53	@erictodd_jones ill be back Friday night
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-18 02:45:41	ANOTHER turnover by Sanchez. Get this idiot out of here. I don't care if its reversed still a stupid decision. Put in Shane Falco #heart
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-18 02:47:16	FACT: Nobody has turned the ball over more than Mark Sanchez since 2011. 46 turnovers. This is our future? #McElroy
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-18 02:48:12	@RealSkipBayless no, he just sucks.
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-18 02:52:08	Jets should just punt the ball on first down every time, our defense has a better shot at scoring than our offense.
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-18 04:40:13	You've got to be kidding me. There's no way any other QB the Jets have could be any worse. NO WAY.
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-18 04:41:24	Can't wait to see Sanchez outside building a new house next year...
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-19 04:54:09	@DatDudeBoZ you tell em
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-20 21:56:26	@VideoGamesFacts @sheehan32  @JMarino13 story of your life Joe
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-20 22:03:40	@DrunkCoachCal what's worse than taking an asteroid to the face tomorrow? Being a Louisville fan. #ApocalypticCal
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-20 22:11:39	People tweeting that the #Mayans aren't right because Australia and NZ are still here are retards. A) time zones b) who do you know there?
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-18 21:52:15	@evanbrunell just set you an email
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-18 21:52:25	@evanbrunell *sent
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-18 22:54:49	@RoyleRich oh so that's the result of sucking way too much D ha
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-22 03:27:32	$20 Mark Sanchez is still our starting QB next year
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-22 22:20:02	Harrow has got to keep being our guy. Playing great right now. Archie 2-12.
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-23 00:42:55	Tosh: Cheating is okay. Mary cheated on Joseph with God and that seemed to work out pretty well for all of us.
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-23 04:08:50	Jewpacabra
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-20 15:22:32	@evanbrunell they're probably counting on a Mark Prior or Kerry Wood return. And don't count out Zambrano either hah
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-22 13:44:17	@ccons23 not gonna happen
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-24 02:32:57	Bring back Alex Smith c'mon this is brutal. Who led you to the NFC title game last year?
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-25 05:47:50	That awesome moment when Kurt Warner comes out of retirement on Madden 13 and you sign him to the Jets #greatxmaspresent  #keepdreaming
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-25 14:22:01	That awkward moment when the dog get more presents than I do... #Ralphie

368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-29 15:45:11	@DrunkMarkStoops or three
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-29 15:54:10	This is the only day of the year where I actually wish I could be in Louisville #GoBigBlue

368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-29 21:30:51	Cardinal fans are just downright ugly. It's awful. I mean, even their cheerleaders look awful #figureitout
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-29 22:07:51	Some false information in that last Louisville commercial...
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-29 22:50:12	Oh Archie! As smooth as the other side of the pillow baby!
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-30 18:33:49	Sanchez... Again. Seriously.
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-30 21:49:51	So funny when the Bears were 8-2 or whatever, and were "so good" and now they are rooting for the Packers to win just to make the playoffs
368934142	salolivet50	2013-01-01 18:39:13	@DickieV 12 maybe. SEC not a shot too much talent in Florida, Tennessee, Mizzou and UK. Conference play will separate strong and weak in A10

368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-29 21:04:28	Look at those hicks wearing red on CBS. Way to represent yourselves well on national TV. #BBN does it better
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-29 21:08:28	Nice dunk.
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-29 22:28:43	Literally just stick Wiltjer on a wing and don't let him touch the ball unless he is wide open because he can't dribble and he can't pass
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-29 22:30:05	And no offense but you UK fans who were "expecting" us to lose, get out. We expect to win every game. I don't care who we play #BBN
368934142	salolivet50	2012-12-29 23:18:48	PROUD of my team. Hell of a comeback on the road against a top 5 team. Confident that we can get #9 this year in Catlanta

368934142	salolivet50	2013-01-23 05:19:17	People getting pissed at @12harrow? Some fans are plain idiots, he's one of maybe three that actually wants to win, not a payday next year.
368934142	salolivet50	2013-01-23 06:25:43	@MarandAnn18 worst show ever created

368934142	salolivet50	2013-01-28 04:17:11	The Blackhawks are having a great start to their year just like the Bears did...
368934142	salolivet50	2013-01-29 17:45:34	As a Yankees fan, A-Rod should be shunned. Absolutely pathetic. Come out with the truth. Stop with the lies.
368934142	salolivet50	2013-01-29 17:59:04	@sheehan32 at least Pettitte did admit to to. Bonds and Clemens need to next
368934142	salolivet50	2013-01-28 14:06:31	@THEVALDIVIA19 well the devils are first in their division... The Yankees are a given, and the jets do plain suck but still
368934142	salolivet50	2013-01-28 18:16:44	Why would we be scared of Indiana basketball when we've already proven we can beat them. We aren't scared of anybody #iubb #sucks #BBN

368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-03 20:30:46	@JenCompton1 too bad we won't be talking about them after the first round
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-03 20:32:38	@JenCompton1 yeah filthy shit it was
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-01 14:10:02	Cannot wait til the second round of the NHL playoffs and everyone can stop talking about the Blackhawks
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-06 03:54:56	@KySportsRadio here's another great Louisville story http://t.co/DnJTmbz2og

368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-09 19:09:18	Unbelievable. Held Florida scoreless for the final 6:30. Great D anchored by @WCS15timefor9 and clutch Uncle Julius #inwilliewetrust #BBN
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-09 20:59:10	Proud I stood by this team all year and didn't give up on them like most everyone else did #BBN now let's go dancing #inwilliewetrust
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-09 21:24:04	Why yes that will be me wearing my Kentucky jersey to an NHL game #gocats #DevsCanes
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-10 03:11:42	Every time Willow posts a tweet I automatically feel so much better about myself.

368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-12 01:55:40	@NathanSchwake bet you the other girl dumps him
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-12 02:00:31	@mo_forsee oh man this other girl is wayyyyyyyy more attractive #gocats
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-12 02:02:56	@mo_forsee jk just saw her face no thanks he should've chosen somebody else #hopeshesaysno
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-12 02:07:00	I hope a mouse runs in front of that elephant #bachelor
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-12 02:22:30	@MyLifeAsEmily3 negative. I got home from hockey and my mom and sister were watching it so I wanted to see who was more attractive.
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-12 02:45:09	@MyLifeAsEmily3 Lindsey no doubt
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-08 03:07:35	I'm feeling a loss to Florida. Grab a 6 seed in the SEC tourney, have Florida lose against Mizzou and have us beat the rest and go dancing
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-12 12:24:23	@MyLifeAsEmily3 yes they are! Hahaha
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-12 12:27:31	@Alex_TheGreat07 don't do it she smells 💩

368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-13 22:48:41	@Alex_TheGreat07 cause you're nowhere near my level
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-13 22:50:34	@Alex_TheGreat07 that's only cause you're dreaming
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-13 22:52:29	@Alex_TheGreat07 probably not the case
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-10 21:12:33	@KateUpton and there's Ralphie! http://t.co/MmnFKQlaGR

368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-10 21:59:12	@KentuckyyBabyy fine then you're missing out
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-14 13:36:53	@AdamSchefter jets going to do anything exciting? Or have they already jumped ship on next season? #2014firstpick
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-14 16:34:08	New catch phrase: "this ham is tasty"

368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-14 16:49:11	Random fact of the day: Costs about $750 to buy a sheep.
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-14 18:25:00	@SethDavisHoops Charlotte literally just made 8 free throws in a row with 5 seconds left down by 3...
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-09 04:33:21	Thank god the Blackhawks finally lost.
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-09 04:35:05	@TessQC friends off?
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-09 04:43:18	@TessQC yes. And?
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-09 04:44:10	@TessQC you do not hate me you love me and you know it.
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-15 15:34:30	@AdamSchefter as a Jets fan, shoot me. What are they doing? They cut everybody cause of salary, then sign this bum? He had 211 yards last yr
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-15 16:58:12	@JenCompton1 probably more like one video haha
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-15 17:02:45	@JenCompton1 instead of one step away, one video away.. Like Erin Andrews... Come on lol
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-15 19:34:40	One of the worst first halves I've ever seen with Michigan and Wisconsin. 20-17 is awful. And it's not because of good defense...
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-15 20:17:48	Trey Burke is TAKING OVER
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-17 14:31:01	Lexington bound
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-17 22:31:28	Boise State did not deserve a bid. Bullshit.
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-17 22:39:42	It's too bad the number 1 overall seed won't win in back to back years
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-18 03:08:20	@TheErinCalipari money talks
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-15 21:47:52	My dad is by far the best at striking up random conversations with the most random people. Right @andiirose23 ? #gasstationprobz
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-15 21:48:54	@ESPNLunardi go Cats
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-16 01:50:59	@ESPNLunardi MTSU has awful non conference schedule no way they get in
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-16 02:33:30	Shocked that we lost tonight. But with literally everyone else losing I think we are still in. A loss by Maryland and Iowa could help though
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-16 12:37:51	@SethDavisHoops what are chances Kentucky makes the field of 68 now?
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-17 21:48:12	Charles Barkley just said the PAC-12 is better than the BIG-10. I think he's on crack.
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-21 14:58:50	@cgrand14 saint Mary's
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 01:47:17	@The_bcal25 your dad is a hell of a coach #coachcalforpresident2016
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-19 23:36:08	It's nice how we are only favored by 4 whereas all the other #1 seeds in this amazing tournament they call the NIT are favored by 10+
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 01:41:37	Rushing the court in the NIT? Really? I remember our first big win. See you next year.
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 01:45:01	Lose today. Julius Randle tomorrow. #BBN
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 02:21:10	Archie is returning. WCS doesn't think he is ready for the NBA. Harrow not transferring. Five-six HS all Americans. 40-0? Buehler? #BBN
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 02:21:30	AND POYTHRESS
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 12:48:33	First day without the beard since Turkey Day 2011 wtf is happening...
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 17:41:57	This is ridiculous. Imagine the lineup:
1-Harrison, Harrow, Polson
2-Archie, Harrison
3-Poythress, Young
4-Randle, Wiltjer
5-Johnson, WCS
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 17:47:10	@WCS15timefor9 oh hell yeah I see you willie #inwilliewetrust
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 17:47:51	@DatDudeBoZ it was tough to see it through the tears
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 18:07:15	@dmart07 don't see you getting to every game before everyone else and rooting for your team. Things change when they all say they want to
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 18:08:29	@dmart07 make up for their mistakes and come back and get number 9. Everyone was pissed last night.
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 18:11:50	@dmart07 what the hell is your problem
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 18:16:31	@dmart07 not over a game. Over a season. They played like they didn't care for the UK on the jersey. But yeah I see your point I know
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 18:17:47	@dmart07 I am consistent. Was at every game, watched every game whether we won or lost. I think you can cut me some slack for one tweet
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 18:24:05	@dmart07 yes. Absolutely furious. Already deleted the tweet lol
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-20 18:33:08	@alex_marmitt @dmart07 hahaha Marmitt I love it
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-22 01:05:25	@SethDavisHoops 2014 Cats. National Championship. Sharpie. #BBN
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-23 22:58:38	@DickieV yeah sensitive because BIG BLUE NATION will never be red. We won our championship. Pressure is all on Louisville. #L1CyaLater #BBN
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-26 01:47:41	Family Guy til 11. Yup.
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-29 04:46:02	I wonder if IU is going to commemorate this season like they did last year. Back to back Sweet 16's? Niiiiiiice. Louisville. You're next.

368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-31 22:40:44	Lady in airport said I have a "movie star name."  Next stop Hollywood?
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-31 23:21:04	Louisville will destroy Wichita St. Only team that has a chance at beating them and keeping up with the pressure is Michigan. Cuse no shot
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-31 23:30:15	@DatDudeBoZ problem with cuse zone is that it is tight. Marquette couldn't hit from outside so they shrunk the zone and let them shoot
368934142	salolivet50	2013-03-31 23:30:54	@DatDudeBoZ can't do that against Louisville. They will spread them apart. And Michigan has trey Burke. That's enough lol
368934142	salolivet50	2013-04-01 00:33:15	@DatDudeBoZ the way this year has gone we're all wrong and Wich St. is gonna SHOCK the nation lol

368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-04 04:21:46	Omg what a catch #SCtop10

368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-05 20:50:06	Looking good Andy Dalton looking goooooood
368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-05 20:59:29	Andy Dalton has thrown as many interceptions today as Nick Foles threw all year.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-06 00:03:05	Oh my Rodgers how in the hell...

368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-10 03:28:38	Bahahahaha Louisville what a joke.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-12 04:44:03	@D_Higgins19 it's called tin roof silly @ahtenfelde @Bane35
368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-12 19:23:04	Idk whose flopping skills are better Cam or LeBron. What have sports come to...
368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-11 20:53:34	Shouldn't it be 11-6.... 9-6, Dakari gets fouled, hits both free throws... Someone at CBS didn't learn their numbers correctly...
368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-12 06:23:15	Have spent the last five and a half hours drinking with @sheehan32 at @LexTinRoof what have our lives come to #nofucksgiven #WOO #Shameless
368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-15 02:05:06	God Indiana is so gay for rushing the court learn how to win properly and with class.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-15 04:24:00	Yes Julius Randle did in fact just out-rebound all five Arkansas players for three straight offensive rebounds #movebitchgetoutdaway
368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-15 04:29:21	HOLY SHIT!!!! YES!!!!
368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-15 04:55:03	Alright that's gotta count for something
368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-18 12:23:22	From 2004-12 60% of UNC basketball and football players read at a 4th-8th grade leave. 10% below 3rd grade level. Why isn't this in the news
368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-19 18:09:45	Waitress just asked me if I wanted ranch with my pizza. Seriously, come on.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-20 02:54:55	And that's why I hate Richard Sherman. No doubt best cornerback in the league but nothing but a straight up thug on and off the field.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-22 20:00:56	It's our second class meeting and this girl already wins teacher's pet #hahaha #nobodycares

368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-30 16:27:05	@Bane35 cause you don't have me running it lol
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-01 18:00:45	I can't stand how Kentucky people eat pizza. It just kills me. Ranch? Dabbing out the grease? Cutting it?! #eastcoast
368934142	salolivet50	2014-01-31 04:47:28	@ESPNStatsInfo except this year the Big East is awful... And they haven't beaten a ranked team all year.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-02 19:58:10	Let's see if Indiana rushes the court here....

368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-08 02:34:59	Couldn't tell you half of these damn countries in the Olympics... Why is Togo in the Winter Olympics lol
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-08 03:13:42	Dear Russia,
You suck. Put on hockey.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-09 15:29:33	ESPN needs to lay off #MarcusSmart and find the fat white asshole who called him a slur. No other reason why Smart would shove him #pathetic
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-09 15:59:05	@ChrisRose48 yeah but no doubt that guy dropped a word white people shouldn't say lol. Should be suspended but not all his fault
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-08 21:52:44	New high score is that good? #flappybird http://t.co/zMx7CnW2Ma

368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-20 19:24:42	@tendy_felde puck never should went in front of the net. Goalie completely messed that up.

368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-22 22:57:09	Just caught an old guy jerkin it in the bathroom. Cop said next time "beat the dogshit out of him and kick his teeth in." #tocatchapredator
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-22 23:14:13	I still love this team, but man we need to figure out our half court offense. Brutal to watch them just stand around the perimeter
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-22 23:28:05	Don't care who we play a win like that takes some serious cajones.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-16 04:22:16	@taylorharryTV @sheehan32 he brought us a national championship. Not many students can say that.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-16 14:07:35	Watching USA hockey game at work, and some asshole gets up and changes the channel... Are you kidding me? #America #USAHockey
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-21 13:51:10	God forbid LeBron leaves a game with a bloody nose. Now I can't turn on SportsCenter today.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-21 19:09:52	Gonna go crawl in a hole and cry now #USA
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-21 23:19:58	Diddy and Drake and many others in new TWC commercial? How can they afford that? Oh yeah by charging us a shit ton for horrible service #twc
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-25 02:16:38	Just won Best Team Name for trivia with "Loose Buttholes." Thank you @sheehan32
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-24 14:32:09	Clowney with a 4.47? Just picture him with JJ Watt.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-03-02 02:36:20	@ChrisRoseBBN @KySportsRadio no he doesn't come on. Brings in best talent in the nation. Already one championship. Can't expect 1 every year
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-28 02:21:09	I can't stand Bob Knight commentating. Quit saying good or no good before every free throw you idiot!
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-28 02:28:42	Seriously Bob Knight, since when is a five point lead a three possession game? One of the stupidest people on ESPN...
368934142	salolivet50	2014-02-28 02:36:03	Can't wait to see everyone give up on this team just like they did around the same time last year. Anyone calling for Cal's head is an idiot

368934142	salolivet50	2014-03-03 05:24:08	Such bullshit. Been sitting in traffic at dead stop for over two hours now because Kentucky drivers can't drive in the rain.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-03-08 15:43:32	@ESPNLunardi can top two teams in conference standings be in same bracket? You have UK-Florida in same region in latest bracket on ESPN 3/6.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-03-08 17:45:13	I feel like Florida just keeps pressing the Staples "That was Easy" button.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-03-08 18:41:47	Literally shitting myself right now. How.... Just how.... Idc I love it #bbn
368934142	salolivet50	2014-03-08 20:18:13	@CollegeSpun lets not blow that statement out of proportion. Let's realize that Doron was no doubt high as shit watching that game anyways.

368934142	salolivet50	2014-03-16 21:36:54	Completely agree with call by Cal at end of the game and go for the win at the buzzer. If Young didn't slip he had a nice lane to the basket
368934142	salolivet50	2014-03-16 21:43:24	There's a reason why Cal is one of the highest paid coaches in college basketball. Quit bitching about the play calling #bbn #ibelieve
368934142	salolivet50	2014-03-16 22:22:36	I'll take that matchup but an 8 seed is an absolute ripoff.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-03-16 22:30:14	As shitty as a draw as an 8 seed we got, I'll take Kansas St and Wichita St all day. Better than facing Duke or Iowa St in a 3/6 matchup
368934142	salolivet50	2014-03-16 22:36:55	SMU didn't get in?! Wow. Shows how weak that AAC is.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-03-16 21:46:55	@sheehan32 if he couldn't draw up a good play then I highly doubt he would have 500+ wins...
368934142	salolivet50	2014-03-16 21:54:29	@sheehan32 never said that. Watch the replay. Young would've had the shot. You even said yourself you wanted them to shoot it at the buzzer.

368934142	salolivet50	2014-03-30 03:10:55	And people give Cal shit for bad play calling at the end of the game. That was horrible lol didn't even get shot off in time

368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-02 15:56:31	@espn talking about Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie but showing clips of Antonio Cromartie #ComeOnMan
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-04 19:11:11	If Kentucky wins it all, I will in fact get UK tattooed on my ass #BBN
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-01 23:51:02	Hey CC lets stop getting behind in the count and laying 88mph fastballs right down the dick to then be launched out of the ballpark #Yankees
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-04 23:26:46	Dear @Hooters , I love your uniforms. #dallastexas @JMarino13 @sheehan32
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-05 02:12:16	@UKTix so you're saying that we already have a "reserved" seat? Even if we are first person in line we are gonna get screwed...
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-05 14:40:34	First one in line for the #FinalFour let's go Cats!!! #BBN http://t.co/bzY8HzOJ4e
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-05 16:17:39	@UKTix this "reserved seat" crap is bullshit. People who are waiting out in line now should be front row. Nobody gave us straight answer.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-05 18:47:42	@UKTix nothing said that you would get a better seat based on when you purchased your ticket. Yes it did say reserved, but not how reserved.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-05 19:43:41	@UKTix never did it say they would be assigned by when first person bought ticket. Ask any UK student waiting outside today, all pissed off.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-08 03:41:56	Still one of the greatest runs I've ever seen by my a Cats. These boys turned into men over the past three weeks and I'm damn proud of them.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-06 03:56:56	I think I've lost 20 years of my life these past two weeks. http://t.co/43KDdl5zOE
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-06 04:12:21	@SportsCenter @heraldleader not even state street. State would be the one where my house is probably burning down #bbn
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-08 05:36:24	@APhilpottWKYT hey we did! Such a tough way to go out after such an amazing run. Love this team #BBN
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-08 05:50:36	Why people are "celebrating" in Lexington is beyond me. We just lost a national championship. Faces should be buried in a pillow right now.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-08 05:57:06	@alex_marmitt the time to celebrate is tomorrow when the team comes back and not by burning shit and injuring people.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-06 17:58:56	Go Cats #atthoop4
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-14 19:09:40	Oh my god @USAirways hahahahaha it's almost too funny that this person needs to get promoted I love it #wefoundflight370
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-15 02:59:30	To the person who left their dog out, helplessly barking in this rain... You're an asshole 👎
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-12 00:15:57	I wish #ShabazzNapier had a twitter so I could tell him I have some leftovers. #BBN http://t.co/AIHkRSjnhD
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-16 18:45:36	@SportBlogNYC what in the world did they just call on that catcher interference play? Obviously not catcher interference...
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-16 18:52:39	@SportBlogNYC just looked it up. Apparently it's a "delayed dead ball." If offense gains more than automatic 1st base, they have choice.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-15 15:42:22	Wow Cal wow. Shutting ESPN up right now I love it haha
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-19 21:59:39	Wow what a game again between the Blues and Hawks. Wish this was the Western Conference finals. New playoff format sucks.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-22 20:18:30	OMG British girls at the hotel 😁😁😁
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-22 03:04:07	Please let this Blues Hawks game go into overtime. I really don't want to start studying. #NHLplayoffs #STLvsCHI
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-24 23:19:05	I now own both Tangled and Frozen. Alright ladies batters up haha
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-26 15:12:22	@JenCompton1 my house haha 😝
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-24 00:11:16	“@rcobb18: 920-206-9414" well we all now have Randall's digits lol
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-24 00:17:30	Hey @espn this "strike zone box" you have on during the baseball game is terrible. Please stop.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-25 17:04:17	Somebody go find out where all those 40-0 shirts went we need them back #BBN @KySportsRadio
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-27 17:02:36	@JohnBaer11 Kwame Brown who cares!!
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-27 17:22:30	@SportBlogNYC some call there by that ref. How did he not see that puck. The camera with the worse angle on the review could even see it wow
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-27 19:26:05	@emilybrooke_xo @Natsack_914 ha gayyyyyyy
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-27 19:27:18	@Natsack_914 @emilybrooke_xo are you all staying in lex this summer?
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-29 01:38:17	God I hope the Penguins blow this
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-30 15:20:53	Oprah is now considering buying the Clippers? Seriously this needs to stop.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-01 14:20:49	This Donald Sterling shit has been blown way out of proportion. I watch ESPN to watch sports not debate about a racist. Get over it.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-30 17:46:57	@prezi any idea how long it will take to fix whatever problem? Have two presentations today, oh boy 😁😁😁
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-30 05:10:59	I can't stand the Warriors purposely fouling Diandre Jordan. It's not how you play the game. Glad he's hitting these free throws #bushleague
368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-02 00:54:25	Omg Ariana Grande is an absolutely smokeshow 😍
368934142	salolivet50	2014-04-30 21:32:48	Just realized it's the 10 year anniversary of #MeanGirls it's Wednesday, and I'm wearing pink... #MeanGirls10thAnniversary
368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-01 04:10:24	What a game. Third time Varlamov beat high blocker tonight... Gotta love some playoff hockey.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-07 23:50:45	Yasiel Puig is such a prick. Dude does a bat flip and the ball didn't even make it to the warning track.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-09 00:47:33	This is definitely the best time of the year. #NFLDraft &gt; Christmas

368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-09 01:06:34	I feel so bad for Johnny. I heard the J and I thought it was him... I still don't understand why they traded up for that

368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-10 17:23:05	@10AJMcCarron with that chip on his shoulder. Can't wait to see him in the NFL proving everybody wrong and winning a Super Bowl #NFLDraft
368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-10 17:52:44	Wtf Tom Savage over AJ McCarron. Absolute joke.

368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-14 02:00:28	@Alex_TheGreat07 they were getting their golf game ready about three weeks before yours
368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-14 02:23:45	I don't understand these e-cigs. No one truly knows how safe or dangerous these things are and I don't want you blowing smoke in my face.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-14 02:44:38	@julesruano oh I will boo hoo lol

368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-22 21:49:02	Wtf Landon Donovan didn't make the US World Cup team? What a joke, I know you can't measure heart, but come on, dude is clutch #USMNT #USA
368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-23 15:25:44	They're already calling Puig's catch last night the catch of the year? He overran the ball and had to catch it backhand that's so stupid.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-26 23:31:19	@ABodes24 good luck. My mind is still blown. Great show though.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-29 22:20:09	@Alex_TheGreat07 what do you mean home lol

368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-31 14:10:08	Hey @espn when are you going to put SportsCenter on? The only thing I've heard in the past 20 min is how great LeBron and the Heat are.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-31 03:33:05	@DatDudeBoZ he put nothing on it... The set up was fine but he literally just threw it at the net.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-05-31 03:33:52	@DatDudeBoZ a shot under his blocker is not a snipe lol
368934142	salolivet50	2014-06-05 23:29:56	Damn Coach Cal gonna be rolling in some serious dough now. 7 years, 52.5 million. Highest paid coach in college basketball. #d9asty #BBN
368934142	salolivet50	2014-06-06 04:21:54	The greatest player in the NBA sitting out the final minutes of the finals due to cramps, what a joke. Let his team down. #Cramps #NoExcuses

368934142	salolivet50	2014-06-21 18:31:18	@Yankees Tino before Bernie or O'Neill? What a joke come on. Bernie was a true Yank, 16 years all in pinstripes. O'Neill way more a fan fav.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-06-22 22:05:59	You've got to be kidding me.... That was just stupid and lazy.

368934142	salolivet50	2014-06-29 15:03:07	@seneca_foskey it's probably closer to 50. I mean come on. Boeheim, miller, tubby, Larry brown, etc there are so many better than him
368934142	salolivet50	2014-06-29 15:06:49	@seneca_foskey well they are going to list coach k and cal ahead of Ollie when the top 5 are released

368934142	salolivet50	2014-06-30 01:24:37	@AJGullotta @Buster_ESPN thank you for retweeting this Buster. Shows how many ignorant baseball "fans" there are out there #probablyasoxfan
368934142	salolivet50	2014-06-29 11:11:58	@espn ranked Kevin Ollie as the 10th best coach in college basketball. What an absolute joke. I could honestly put 30 coaches ahead of him.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-07-01 21:38:32	Tim Howard for President.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-07-08 00:59:34	@sagreeney looking great in first career start as a Yank. Gorgeous K in the 5th, 94 at the knees on the corner. Need all the help we can get
368934142	salolivet50	2014-07-11 16:27:00	Holy shit LeBron to Cleveland. Hahaha Heat fans where ya at?
368934142	salolivet50	2014-07-11 22:17:45	Cavaliers fans chanting on ESPN, "we have real fans." Are you kidding me? I respect LeBron's decision but these "fans" are a joke.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-07-11 01:16:22	Well the Yankees season is officially over. Masahiro on the DL. Probably the most injury riddled team I've ever seen... Brutal.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-07-14 04:15:39	@emilybrooke_xo omg who the fuck is bae lol
368934142	salolivet50	2014-07-20 23:59:36	Set up satellite to my house, all i get is Fox, which is fine. But bobs burgers is officially the worst show ever. I mean it's horrible.

368934142	salolivet50	2014-07-31 00:11:55	Brett Gardner is on a whole other level right now. Unbelievable. #Yankees
368934142	salolivet50	2014-08-03 00:54:37	That should be an error on Morse. Any regular LF would've caught that ball. Horrible way to give up a perfect game. #MLB #SFGiants

368934142	salolivet50	2014-08-07 20:03:27	@sagreeney great job today. Stole a win going against one of the best pitchers in the AL this year. Way to put the team on your back. #yanks
368934142	salolivet50	2014-08-10 15:03:06	Whether or not Tony Stewart hit that guy on purpose, idk. But he had no business walking in the middle of the race track at a speeding car.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-08-28 21:59:49	College football season baby!!!!
368934142	salolivet50	2014-08-30 16:07:11	@ustate16 for Heisman. Heard it here first!
368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-06 20:33:33	That wasn't even close...
368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-07 21:37:00	Tony Romo.... Looking gooooooood
368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-09 00:59:33	How was that an interception..?
368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-08 20:13:30	Funny how Clowney didn't put forth any effort last year to avoid getting hurt, now he's been hurt three separate times since being drafted.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-14 02:01:32	Absolutely unreal...
368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-14 03:18:19	No way. No way. Wow.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-17 15:23:22	@ChrisRoseBBN @KySportsRadio unless Towles has Mike's Secret Stuff, no way we are beating USC.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-19 03:00:35	I think UK Football could've beaten Tampa Bay tonight.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-20 14:43:10	Bubba Winston Crab Shack hahahaha I'm  dying
368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-26 01:28:30	What a spot for Captain Clutch. Let's go Derek! End your career at the Stadium with a bang!

368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-28 19:14:35	Hey Cutler your team isn't wearing white. Just thought I'd give you the heads up.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-28 20:02:13	@sheehan32 no he doesn't?
368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-28 20:03:41	@sheehan32 wait for romo tonight lpl
368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-28 20:04:11	@sheehan32 either way, wasn't talking about Geno in that tweet.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-28 20:55:04	@sheehan32 so I'm not allowed to talk about any other team other than my own?
368934142	salolivet50	2014-09-28 20:57:42	@sheehan32 I can't help that Geno can't finish in the red zone
368934142	salolivet50	2014-10-05 03:30:46	Kentucky football... ON THE MAP!!!
368934142	salolivet50	2014-10-07 00:37:44	Time Warner you suck. Can't even watch Monday Night Football cause you black it out. Way to go.

368934142	salolivet50	2014-10-19 01:17:44	Our special teams sucks. That should literally never happen. This game should be no more than a 7-10 point difference.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-10-20 01:44:39	Peyton is going to destroy this record. Next target: 600.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-10-27 01:12:07	Can't believe Oscar Tavares just passed.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-01 17:09:52	Officially can't stand Joey Galloway as an announcer.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-01 20:48:47	Holy Horton!
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-01 22:08:21	Our offensive tackles look like little traffic cones right now.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-01 23:11:26	This play calling blows
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-02 02:25:29	It's too bad one of these teams will be out of the top 4. #AUBvsMISS has been one of the greatest games this year
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-02 02:40:59	Wtf was Ole Miss trying to do on that last play? You can't throw the ball forward after a lateral across the line of scrimmage cmon Bo...
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-09 21:17:19	Some flop from that 49ers corner...
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-09 18:57:22	It only took half the season for the Jets to finally show up...
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-11 02:52:52	All I need from Cam Newton is four little fantasy points to win this week, just four points. Is that hard Cam? Is it? #CARvsPHI
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-11 04:14:51	How bad the Panthers WR core is: Joe Webb, former Minnesota QB is currently on the field playing wide receiver for Carolina... Wow
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-12 00:39:14	Wow. TCU as #4 is an absolute joke.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-12 04:26:06	These ESPN announcers for Tuesday night football are absolutely, insanely stupid.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-14 19:39:09	And the wait for game day begins... #UK #Catsby90 #BBN http://t.co/bHZttXTfvz
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-16 15:21:54	@KirkHerbstreit yes, because OSU has beaten so many more ranked (let alone good) teams than Miss St. has...
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-20 22:27:15	There is finally a cookie/ice cream/whatever late night delivery service here in lexington OMG @insomniacookies #BBN http://t.co/NnpXgIl9Y1
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-29 18:26:56	OHHHHHH BABY!!!!!!!!
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-29 19:04:15	@Alli_crandell9 lol its college basketball season here
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-29 20:05:53	Holy shit
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-29 20:32:33	BOOM!!!!!!!!
368934142	salolivet50	2014-11-29 19:02:20	@Alli_crandell9 Ohio state sucks
368934142	salolivet50	2014-12-06 22:18:41	@JMarino13 @sheehan32 @TheycallmeLofty @ryanjallen_ if we find tickets I'll come back from NC early and go
368934142	salolivet50	2014-12-06 01:44:19	Refs are literally doing everything and anything possible to keep this a close game
368934142	salolivet50	2014-12-07 17:45:14	Such bullshit. Can't wait for OSU to get steamrolled.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-12-07 17:45:44	TCU wins 55-3 and drops three spots, that's horrible.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-12-07 17:54:48	Lol CFB Playoff Chair refuses to say it, and avoiding question of Big 12 needing a championship game.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-12-19 02:04:18	ESPN has Ryan Harrow as a top 10 point guard. LOL.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-12-20 20:55:04	LOL. Just LOL.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-12-21 04:53:14	Can CBS/NFL Network stop flashing the "Thursday Night Football" logo? Someone's getting fired lol #SDvsSF @CBSSports @nflnetwork
368934142	salolivet50	2014-12-21 20:24:25	What a horrible call. How they ruled that the ball did not cross the plane is terrible. Possibly ruined outcome of the game. #ATLvsNO #joke
368934142	salolivet50	2014-12-27 19:11:18	ESPNEWS people.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-12-27 19:16:20	Refs letting them play and be physical. I like it.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-12-27 19:48:11	How is that not a flagrant one? Accidental or not an elbow is an elbow.
368934142	salolivet50	2014-12-27 20:20:25	LOL NICE FLOP!
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-01 02:22:16	#PitbullNYE sucks lol. Guys dancing to try and get a girl to pick them for a date. Bartender duel. And now scrabble. What a joke. #NYE2015
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-02 01:26:35	OF COURSE TIME WARNER IS EXPERIENCING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES WITH THE WATCH ESPN APP. YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE. #timewarnercable
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-10 20:20:11	How many wide open lay ups are we going to miss. This is ridiculous.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-10 20:28:26	@KySportsRadio neither does A&amp;M lol
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-10 20:30:27	These refs blow. He was in bounds.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-10 20:49:07	Ulis got some cajones
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-10 20:56:18	Ugh. I have a headache. Thank god we pulled this one out.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-10 20:59:18	@DrunkCoachCal but half an hour ago: "40-0. Not happening." Lol
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-11 19:17:18	Second Witten catch in a row where the refs have given him over a yard further from where his forward progress stopped. Horrible.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-14 02:10:19	Willis &gt; Hawkins. Please Cal.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-18 21:00:48	God I hope the Packers win.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-18 21:01:22	@RealSkipBayless the guy had his arm pressing against Bulaga's neck...
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-18 22:07:55	That was an awesome play. Carroll has some balls for calling that.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-18 23:04:30	You had one job Green Bay, ONE JOB.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-18 23:12:16	Will the real MVP please stand up. Come on Rodgers.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-18 23:29:46	What a joke
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-18 23:32:02	Can't wait for another ridiculous Richard Sherman interview...
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-23 03:46:06	@EASPORTSNHL installed update from last night now game keeps freezing during warm ups yet Doc and Olczyk keep running their mouths. Help?
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-28 01:33:04	Apparently Darryl Isaacs got into a car wreck, naturally somebody said this: "Somebody hammered the hammer." Lol I'm dying 😂😂😂
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-30 02:10:11	Filthy and 1 Andrew
368934142	salolivet50	2015-01-30 02:26:28	Not a big fan of Hawkins but he is impressing me so far tonight. Love the hustle.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-02-02 02:57:30	Holy shit
368934142	salolivet50	2015-02-02 03:00:13	WHY WOULD YOU NOT RUN THE FOOTBALL
368934142	salolivet50	2015-02-02 03:05:51	At least this gives the chance for the Pats to get stripped of winning the super bowl once this investigation gets released.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-02-02 01:06:27	These announcers talking about how Brady and Wilson and bring smart in attack the young and inexperienced cornerbacks... Like no shit...
368934142	salolivet50	2015-02-03 02:52:24	Dammit EA. NHL 15 keeps freezing so I call customer service and have been transferred three times to three Indians who can't even say hockey
368934142	salolivet50	2015-02-02 03:04:01	What an absolute joke.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-02-02 03:04:24	And now a disgrace.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-02-11 01:32:19	Wtf is happening....
368934142	salolivet50	2015-02-11 01:56:29	I need a beer
368934142	salolivet50	2015-02-10 14:21:45	@KySportsRadio if Gonzaga were to win it all, would @kwiltj be the first PLAYER to win an NCAA Championship with two different teams?
368934142	salolivet50	2015-02-18 00:33:17	Lol that cheerleader got trucked
368934142	salolivet50	2015-02-18 00:35:13	In what world is that goaltending?
368934142	salolivet50	2015-02-17 04:46:05	Slightly confused why West Virginia, a ranked team, rushed the floor when they beat another ranked team, Kansas, in a conference game...
368934142	salolivet50	2015-03-12 21:44:11	Texas A&amp;M's bubble just went 💦💦💦 #MarchMadness #bubbleweek
368934142	salolivet50	2015-03-15 22:26:08	UCLA making it in is a joke
368934142	salolivet50	2015-03-15 17:10:43	Legggoo BIG BLUEEEEEEE!!!
368934142	salolivet50	2015-03-19 18:43:13	BRACKETS BUSTED.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-03-22 01:34:42	NC State over Nova! Got it!
368934142	salolivet50	2015-03-22 18:15:11	Michigan State! Got it!
368934142	salolivet50	2015-03-31 14:02:36	@UKTix 10:01, can't believe no more student tickets. Figured someone would mess up lol
368934142	salolivet50	2015-04-09 18:41:10	Wow. This hurts.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-04-09 18:47:33	I don't think all of them are ready, but I'm glad and proud of these guys making the last two seasons in Lexington so special #BBN
368934142	salolivet50	2015-04-19 19:02:38	@ChrisRoseBBN the only real playoffs going on are the #NHLPlayoffs
368934142	salolivet50	2015-05-10 22:11:42	@sabriiinasays Kia's have great warranties.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-05-28 02:31:55	Ducks BY FAR the better team.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-05-28 02:35:47	And of course the Hawks get just one opportunity and they capitalize.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-06-06 22:55:43	That was insane.
368934142	salolivet50	2015-06-08 02:21:55	Why is this taking so long. Not even close to a flagrant. Only cause it's LeBron.
