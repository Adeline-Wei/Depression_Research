370934809	RyanHowling	2012-08-12 09:59:01	Sitting outside for once, makes a nice change to have weather like this in England. #LushWeather
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-09-23 15:26:27	The sound of someone eating has to be the most irritating, inconvenient noise ever. #GoAway
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-10-06 22:57:37	Headphones in, @ConorMaynard full blast! #Perfection
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-10-21 21:03:32	Time for @OnlyWayIsEssex! #BestPartOfSunday
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-11-03 02:14:12	The only thing I can actually find to drink is 'Bitter Lemon' and 'Vodka Mixers'. #NotHappy
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-11-11 02:22:50	Headphones in, tunes on. #ThisIsTheLife
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-11-11 21:10:51	Been waiting all year for @imacelebrity, love this show so much!
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-11-15 01:46:24	Can't go wrong with a bit of @chrisbrown! #Tunes
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-11-27 21:26:51	Haven't been to London for ages, need to get Christmas presents sorted! #NotLongNow
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-11-27 20:34:43	Watching @imacelebrity, can't believe it's the final on Saturday! #GoneSoQuick
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-11-29 01:13:24	It's so cold tonight! #Freezing
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-12-01 00:09:40	Just realised that it is now the first of December! #TwentyFourDaysTillChristmas
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-12-11 19:03:04	Right okay, 'White Hot Chocolate' is actually peng, has to be the best drink I have ever had!
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-12-14 13:46:23	Just because you want to see me, doesn't mean I want to see you.
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-12-12 00:03:43	@amber_w123, awh, and no, it broke literally the other day and my BBM ran out anyway! Living without any phone is stressful enough... x
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-12-12 00:06:35	@amber_w123, haha! I know, it's ridiculous! My Mum has brought me an iPhone, just gotta wait till Christmas now though! And yeah sure! x
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-12-17 13:46:22	Headphones in, wrapping up Christmas presents.
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-12-19 10:59:05	Because you are so selfish, you are going to loose everyone and everything around you.
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-12-19 14:34:28	@MattBramston, haha it becomes pretty annoying too though!
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-12-18 21:54:40	I take ages to reply to messages, then when I actually do, I get no replies. #Jheeze
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-12-18 22:13:23	@JessHo_Berridge, thankyou for everything and sorry I couldn't do today, need to see you before Christmas though! x
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-12-22 00:26:55	You have to be selfish in life to move on, it's not always about pleasing everyone else. #LifeLesson
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-12-19 16:31:22	@JessHo_Berridge, awh, and me too! Maybe it just needs time, then they might sort it out! Thankyou again though! x
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-12-21 13:11:17	Everything is so much effort at the moment.
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-12-23 23:51:48	Been there, done that, moved on.
370934809	RyanHowling	2012-12-26 00:46:03	Christmas isn't over until New Years Day is over?
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-01-14 02:15:25	Never change yourself to please other people, don't let yourself forget who you are.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-01-08 00:55:41	I think I'm slowly falling for you.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-01-25 01:10:48	@Ellie_Quigley, Happy Birthday babe, hope you have a great day and get everything you asked for, and hope you have a good night tomorrow! x
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-01-25 22:37:50	Congratulations to @RylanClark, deserved to win more than anyone, he is so genuine and he's done Essex proud! #CBB
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-01-26 07:59:59	This is the earliest I've been up for weeks.

370934809	RyanHowling	2013-02-05 23:30:58	Some people tell so many lies that they manage to convince themselves it's the truth.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-02-02 10:39:28	Didn't realise how cold it was outside today, I'm freezing.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-02-02 19:43:42	@MaderzGirl3, yeah babe! I'm gonna try and come down next Saturday, but if not I'll be down the following Saturday! xxx

370934809	RyanHowling	2013-02-11 20:46:02	@Ellie_Quigley, do I need to back comb it right to the end of the sections? xxx
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-02-11 20:52:10	@Ellie_Quigley, okay, and yeah because when I put too much in, it looks like I haven't washed my hair haha, I'll give it a go without! xxx
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-02-11 21:01:37	Once I get it into my head that I want food, I go on a mission until I find it.

370934809	RyanHowling	2013-02-21 18:47:48	My life revolves around Twitter. How did I become so addicted?
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-02-16 23:08:23	It was lovely to see @cherylfergison1 today, you are so sweet! x
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-02-23 18:09:57	@MissAmyChilds is such a good friend to me, lovely to see you again today! x
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-02-26 23:21:40	You don't realise how addicted you can become to something until you discover Twitter.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-02-26 23:59:08	@OlivBloisSharpe, make my life complete by noticing me! I'm a massive fan of you, you are so sweet! x

370934809	RyanHowling	2013-03-05 23:32:53	Being unique is key to being successful.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-03-06 16:11:10	The more I get told that I can't do something, the more determined and motivated I become.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-03-03 20:33:57	@missliatompkins, thankyou! xxx

370934809	RyanHowling	2013-03-13 00:03:15	If you haven't been to Essex, you haven't lived.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-03-11 16:48:57	Getting knocked back only helps you to become a stronger, more determined person.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-03-19 23:23:42	@JaymiGirlssss, aha, you're so cute! xxxx
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-03-23 22:11:02	There is nothing to watch on a Saturday night anymore.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-03-24 14:42:47	Some people won't change, no matter how many chances you give them.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-03-24 22:50:31	@KarenDerbidge, hope you and Harry are well, haven't seen you both for a while! xx
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-03-24 22:52:07	@KarenDerbidge, will do! I'll be down on Saturday, will you be in? xx
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-03-25 21:38:22	The greatest advantage of speaking the truth is that you don't have to remember what you said.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-03-30 08:56:46	En route to Essex to see @MissAmyChilds; need to catch up, missed you! x

370934809	RyanHowling	2013-04-05 21:55:59	If we're not supposed to eat at night, then why is there a light in the Fridge?

370934809	RyanHowling	2013-04-18 20:06:58	Confidence comes naturally with success, but success comes only to those who are confident.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-04-20 21:41:54	It doesn't matter where I am, when I hear @NICKIMINAJ played I get so unbelievably hyped.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-04-21 16:46:02	Celebrating with @MissAmyChilds and @David_uk_Peters for completing the London Marathon, well done to both of you!

370934809	RyanHowling	2013-04-23 21:02:46	There are no shortcuts to any place that is worth going to.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-04-24 19:43:00	Great things do happen, when you distance yourself from all the negative people.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-04-24 20:34:38	Would make my night complete if @MissKatiePrice noticed me!
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-05-13 17:21:03	We build up walls to not keep people out, but to see who cares enough to tear them down.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-05-14 22:23:45	My biggest inspiration has to be @TheDappy; true talent and doesn't give up what he believes in!
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-05-29 22:27:33	It takes a minute to develop a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-06-01 09:47:12	@MissAmyChilds waving as she drove past me, haha!
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-06-04 18:44:37	I can never actually end a call on an iPhone, I always press something else.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-06-12 16:54:49	It's amazing how one little thing can put you in such a bad mood.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-06-26 22:01:43	@HayleySimmons84, haha, I'm not the only one thinking this then! x

370934809	RyanHowling	2013-07-24 13:15:12	In order to succeed, your desire for success must be greater than your fear of failure.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-08-31 12:33:35	Sometimes you have to forget what is gone, appreciate what still remains and look forward to what is coming next.
370934809	RyanHowling	2013-09-02 15:41:49	@Thomas_Lavone, please follow me! I'm inspired by you all the way from England here!
