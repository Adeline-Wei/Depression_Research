372862942	J_moe223	2012-09-02 21:47:12	@KyleBevis199 it wouldn't because it would attract bears. He planned on it not making noise.
372862942	J_moe223	2012-09-04 20:15:10	Ok, this guy at the gym is making faces and screaming at the mirror. Thing is...he's not even working out...#weird #creepy

372862942	J_moe223	2012-10-05 15:17:41	@MaryHall13 you have to yell and make a scene sometimes in order to get me to pay attention to whats going on. Haha

372862942	J_moe223	2012-10-16 03:28:02	I haven't said one word about football to any bama fan, they seem to feel the need to be obnoxious. Why is that @Cbtide ?

372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-07 17:54:04	@LaceyNElliott it's yours then!
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-07 20:59:41	@ElizaJHolley I never said you were ignorant. Having served, I've had way worse said to me. Some mean well but don't think before speaking.
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-07 21:00:59	@ElizaJHolley also wasn't a personal attack against you.
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-07 21:27:58	@ElizaJHolley I got ya. I was saying the person who said "happy" was ignorant. Never meant offense to you. People mean well but don't think.
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-07 21:30:28	@ElizaJHolley I've come.back from deployment and people would say things meaning well but came off offensive. Thats what I meant.
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-07 21:43:31	@ElizaJHolley True. I was just giving them credit for knowing what day it was.
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-07 17:00:02	@ElizaJHolley I believe they're talking about remembrance.
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-07 17:06:29	@LaceyNElliott I've got a gym pass for downtown max fitness. Would you like to have it? I told @Shannanigans20  that I have 2-3 7 day passes
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-07 19:50:54	@ElizaJHolley maybe im just use to people saying ignorant things like this.
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-05 04:25:29	A night of studying and watching The Dark Knight Rises. Could be better but it could be worse.
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-12 05:26:37	Social disorganization theory, strain theory, social learning theory.....wtf?! To hell with this studying crap. #headhurts #breaktime
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-11 05:42:44	I really need to go to bed, but spending most the day in the library makes me want to enjoy that im not in the library right now.
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-25 04:19:28	Merry Christmas! Hallelujah! Holy Shit, where's the Tylenol?!
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-28 19:52:43	@reallesstroud  the 10 day episodes were awesome! Looking forward to new episodes. #can'twait #impatient
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-26 04:28:38	@MaryHall13 as a long time member of the "Lonely Hearts Club" I beg to differ.
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-26 04:34:17	After watching How to Train your Dragon and A Christmas Story Marathon I think I've had my fill. Oh wait, Clint Eastwood marathon? Sweet.
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-26 04:34:42	@MaryHall13 and because it's Christmas right?
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-26 04:36:13	@MaryHall13 it is pretty friggin' awesome.

372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-31 23:24:12	Said hello to someone I haven't seen in a while. They acted snotty and gave me a look like I farted. Now I wish I did drop a fart. #stuckup
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-27 21:41:19	I really need to find more hobbies or interests. I'm getting bored a lot easier and more often.
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-28 03:29:26	Boredom cured by espn 30 for 30 films. #thankgod #needanewhobby
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-31 02:47:41	@_shellsie I hope everything is ok.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-01 18:39:59	I think I'm done with drinking for a while. #hurting #tooOLD
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-03 08:10:41	I've given my word that I'll be up and productive at 6am. Not sure if thats going to happen. #can'tsleep
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-31 17:18:18	@_shellsie well I hope he gets better soon.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-03 18:22:43	I find myself looking forward to classes starting again. Once they start, I'll be hating life.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-02 01:28:53	I have felt like hammered shit all day long.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-02 02:57:32	@AStormMcCann it looks like a badass movie!
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-02 03:28:36	I'm finally feeling better. Too bad it's 9:28.... #daywasted
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-02 05:22:40	@ElizaJHolley either that or I'm getting too old to drink a lot and stay up late anymore.....
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-04 00:06:20	Ok @jaredwillingham  and @prt4usc  lets get this show on the road!
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-02 16:08:52	@ElizaJHolley I'm ok with it but sometimes I forget I'm getting older. I just need to stay in and watch marathons next year.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-04 16:14:32	While driving home I saw a guy rapping and throwing gang signs...#Whitey #MadRhymes&amp;LyricsYo
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-02 20:54:47	Today has been WAY more productive than yesterday.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-04 21:32:37	@KtBethBullen classy lady.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-05 00:45:43	How are you feeling @prt4usc ?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-05 02:04:54	@macklaynebrown come eat wild wings with all of us tonight. Some people from best buy are going.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-05 02:08:48	#Manziel is a beast. #CottonBowl
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-05 02:10:50	@macklaynebrown what?! Its 8:09! School hasn't started yet! Thats when I'm in bed at 8. Hahaha
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-05 02:15:11	@macklaynebrown oh, me too. Haha Just thought you might enjoy friends, food, and football. I'll ask earlier next time.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-05 07:17:05	That time at the bar where the band is really good and everyone loves each other.... #goodnight #peopleRmissingout
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-05 07:31:16	Well maybe everyone doesn't love each other.... The band is good though!
372862942	J_moe223	2012-12-30 00:36:18	Can't wait until NYE. I'll say that and then realize that that I'm old as shit. #oldmanprobs #needabeer
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-06 00:25:41	I kinda want to go out tonight, but I know I'll be out Monday night and up till 6am with @jaredwillingham @andrew_cooper37 #BCS #alcoholics
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-06 07:16:10	@andrew_cooper37 well I know we'll be out that late. Maybe not drinking but I foresee a long night.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-06 07:27:53	"@B_Reediculous: I hate numbers... There are too many of them."
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-06 16:43:53	@andrew_cooper37 well I don't get off work Monday until 10. I have faith in your drinking ability, but not mine.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-06 18:30:08	"Best Booties of 2013" tv has either hit an all time high or an all time low. Also, 2013 just started. Most anticipated booties?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-10 23:52:21	@MaryHall13 @dancummings12  thanks for the video by the way. #hilarious
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-11 23:22:38	@kelseywoodman Waiting with great anticipation.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-12 02:09:24	Ha Well I guess I am going out tonight. Looper can wait, I guess.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-12 02:34:46	@MaryHall13 I'm guessin' you can kiss my ass. I guess.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-12 03:44:22	@MaryHall13 .............. (blank face)
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-12 04:25:03	@B_Reediculous I can't wait to watch it. Everyone says it's amazing.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-11 14:53:06	Everyone is getting sick. I'm taking vitamins and Airborne like it's going out of style. #toHELLwiththeflu
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-11 19:51:15	"@NeelyBoo: The guy in front of me in my learning psych class smells like Yoda's ball sack. #awesome"

372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-11 19:54:02	@alexandriaCK my paranoia has kept me from getting sick. The news reported a new flu strain that's spreading. #NOthankyou
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-11 21:16:14	@alexandriaCK I demand that you stand 20ft. away so I don't get sick. If what you have to say is important....you may yell it out.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-13 21:15:13	"@B_Reediculous: The Atlanta Falcons make me want to soberly smoke 11 cartons of cigarettes." The way most Vols fans feel these days.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-09 02:12:38	@dylan2605 I just hate it when people act like self absorbed douches. No need. Just be healthy.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-09 05:08:46	Well classes start back tomorrow, and I didn't do a damn thing today or tonight. @JustifiedFX  was awesome though! #findingwaystowin
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-11 23:17:49	@kelseywoodman Very disappointed with your lack of tweeting...
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-12 01:59:42	Do I need to go out tonight? I did buy Looper for blu-ray..... #decisions
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-12 02:52:58	@dancummings12 @MaryHall13  Are y'all going out tonight?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-12 05:58:51	Guy at the bar is playing old school Charlie and the Chocolate factory songs. And now the Lion King song. Ha
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-12 06:10:37	@kelseywoodman  what are you guys getting into? Wolf house?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-12 06:21:16	@kelseywoodman Tell @andrew_cooper37  to friggin' text back. Bar kinda blows tonight.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-12 07:06:45	Now he's singing "The Way You Make Me Feel" by Michael Jackson on the guitar. Doing a damn good job too.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-12 07:14:43	@kelseywoodman oh, well I've been listening to this guy play the.most random songs. And he's MF'N good too!
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-12 14:53:42	I'm disappointed with the majority of Saturday morning cartoons that are on TV these days. Or maybe I'm getting old... Nah, they suck.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-07 01:09:03	@MaryHall13 let me know when you're done being sick. School is about start and you, Dan, me, and everyone else have to do something soon.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-07 02:22:09	@MaryHall13 you are too kind madam.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-07 03:33:01	@dylan2605 I've got an android. What did you twat bud?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-07 03:35:03	@KtBethBullen Justified and Archer are coming back on. I'm right there with ya.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-07 03:36:06	Bored. Got a snapchat to see what was so special. Uses name is jasonfmoore
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-07 03:52:35	@dylan2605 thanks for the thumbs up. However, you sir, can suck it.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-07 04:00:14	@dylan2605 Just so you know I can't see nor can you send me one. #Iwin
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-14 03:00:47	I'm hungry as hell and Greek yogurt ain't cuttin' it.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-12 16:48:21	Looper was a fan-damn-tastic movie! One of the best I've seen in a while.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-09 16:00:27	Every class I have on campus this semester are in the same classroom. Today they're within 10 min. of each other. Need a change of scenery.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-09 19:12:46	I'm thinking a good cigar and a glass of whiskey is in order for this Friday or Saturday evening.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-13 21:30:56	@B_Reediculous except we didn't win in an amazing comeback....
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-14 20:52:51	Alright, I get a phone upgrade soon. What should I get? Iphone or Galaxy S III? #opinions?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-14 22:58:18	I smell weed. In the gym. #NOjoke
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-10 17:15:32	People make it awkward when they just stare at you. #weird #wtf
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-10 19:20:01	@Cbtide has there been another shooting?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-08 01:37:06	Its a ghost town here at work, and I'm missing out on all the #BCS partying. I'm a TN fan so all I can do is drink large amounts of alcohol.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-15 23:52:08	I'm having cravings for some wild wings and a tall glass of beer.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-16 02:20:42	Watching #Justified is probably one the few good things about a Tuesday in January.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-20 14:44:28	Thinking about buying Dredd and season 3 of Justified today. Both are equally friggin' amazing.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-20 17:21:19	@B_Reediculous what?! You say something?!
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-17 23:37:48	Did I know better than to come to wal-mart? Yes. Did I come anyway. Yes. #I'mdumb
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-17 02:04:54	@kelseywoodman  Hey, inspirational quotes aren't that bad. Churchill and Lennon have very insightful sayings.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-17 05:05:38	@kelseywoodman Good point.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-21 01:50:14	I need a crazy adventure soon. Who's up for going to Mardi Gras this year?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-21 01:57:51	@Cbtide No, you would be ok.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-17 17:04:53	"@andrew_cooper37: I wonder if Alabama's offense knew Manti Te'o existed."
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-17 20:34:03	I have no energy and I'm starting feel like hammered shit.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-09 01:21:57	So you're trying eat healthier and you're going to the gym now? Awesome. Just finish those two extra large Monster energy drinks first...
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-09 01:55:38	@dylan2605 when people do that I sometimes wish a truck would drive right through the mirror at them. #douchebags
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-21 22:40:50	I've felt like hammered shit all day. I would love to have the energy just to do simple tasks. Like getting up.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-18 20:05:25	I finally got a hair cut. Its been shaggy for so long I forgot what it's like to have short hair.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-18 20:12:21	@oakleyerin  Happy Birthday!
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-19 02:42:09	It's rude to stare people. Did I fart, step in shit, or have sex with your mom? Either speak or quit staring, mouth breather.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-23 13:50:36	Sometimes you just need the right kind of music to get you going.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-25 18:48:05	All week I've said I'm doing something this Saturday. Now all I want to do is relax. #oldmanprobs
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-23 22:15:27	@andrew_cooper37 I've got a 3 step plan for saturday night. Step one: buy liquor. Step 2: get shit hammered. Step 3: find cool &amp; fun people.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-24 01:18:23	@andrew_cooper37 yeah, I work Friday night and I work 8am-4pm Saturday.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-26 03:27:53	Like my hat? http://t.co/dRewTUqf
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-24 02:58:06	@andrew_cooper37  I know you hate otr but I'm meeting some buddies for a couple of beers. Want to come?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-24 03:18:16	@andrew_cooper37 not there yet. About to leave.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-24 03:37:08	@andrew_cooper37 not crowded. It's kinda chill thought.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-24 03:38:18	@J_moe223 @andrew_cooper37 though*
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-19 19:23:23	@andrew_cooper37 I thought you finished the paper last night.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-19 20:54:26	I want to go watch a movie soon. Maybe Jack Reacher, Gangster Squad, Mama, or the last stand. A lot of good choices. #decisions
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-20 00:55:43	I'm wearing a vest with the name of the store on it. Yeah, I work here dip shit. #retarded #stupidquestions
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-29 22:27:14	I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing for spring break this year.....
372862942	J_moe223	2013-01-31 01:17:18	Almost every guy in this room should drop at least $20.00 in the douchebag jar right now.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-02-02 19:26:45	Finally got my new phone! Woo!
372862942	J_moe223	2013-02-02 23:53:44	Too be honest, it's Saturday and all I want to is relax and do nothing. Well maybe grab some food.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-02-05 19:10:44	It's really hard to procrastinate when there's nothing on tv.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-02-05 21:11:40	@oakleyerin um go to waffle house? Waffles are better than nothing. Haha
372862942	J_moe223	2013-02-05 21:43:07	@oakleyerin hey, I'm just trying to help. Haha
372862942	J_moe223	2013-02-05 21:58:25	@oakleyerin yes, calorie and fat free pancakes....with either blue berries or bananas. #mmm #pancakes
372862942	J_moe223	2013-02-06 01:32:17	Do you ever just look at someone and say, "Hey, I'd totally punch them in the dick and/or vagina." Anyone ever just think that?

372862942	J_moe223	2013-02-02 00:57:55	I have a confession. I passed gas at the gym and blamed an elderly gentleman. I feel ashamed but also triumphant that I got away with it.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-02-03 16:46:38	I finally got up and ran. Now to finish 2 online quizzes and get ready for work. Feeling accomplished but still not very motivated. #wtf?

372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 02:38:23	I shouldn't feel like hammered shit after a workout. I hope that I'm not getting sick.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 02:41:55	@otree8 @j_MCTWiN @jbpesnell @07HannahB drunk people trying to make it to work on time?

372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 02:46:12	@j_MCTWiN @otree8 @jbpesnell @07HannahB whoa! Let's not blame this guy. I'm about to do some serious subtweeting...
372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 02:48:06	Such douche nuggets....#subtweeting
372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 02:50:28	@j_MCTWiN @otree8 @jbpesnell @07HannahB You're at a 9. Let's bring it down to 2. #thanks #boom

372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 02:53:16	@SavMauter I friggin' love that place.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 10:14:39	@otree8 @j_MCTWiN @jbpesnell @07HannahB Sorry guys, turns out that I won't be making it tonight. Bww tomorrow night?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 10:16:11	@otree8 @j_MCTWiN @jbpesnell @07HannahB I love y'all too.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-30 19:00:45	So I'm taking a random elective this summer. I'm taking first aid. If anyone needs saving, you know where to find me.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-29 02:44:51	Tango and Cash is on along with the old Judge Dredd movie? Uh oh....cheesy one liners overload.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 14:09:03	Saying you're not conceited then complimenting yourself is like saying no offense and saying something offensive. Those words aren't magic.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-30 21:56:42	I don't understand subtweeting. Just tell them. For instance, @otree8 you're an asshole, but I love ya man. #easy #honest #stillfriends

372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 01:17:24	@otree8 Ok, let's go back to subtweeting.

372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 01:35:08	@Cbtide @j_MCTWiN @otree8 @jbpesnell @07HannahB I totally understand. #oldmanprobs
372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 01:35:55	@otree8 @jbpesnell @Cbtide @j_MCTWiN @07HannahB I get my library time in during the day. #allgood
372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 01:39:27	@otree8 @jbpesnell @Cbtide @j_MCTWiN @07HannahB I have to work Saturday morning at 8:45am. This might be the only problem.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-02 00:50:10	After feeling like complete ass I'm slowly getting my appetite back. Yay for medicated naps!
372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 01:43:52	@otree8 @jbpesnell @Cbtide @j_MCTWiN @07HannahB well damn.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 01:55:03	@j_MCTWiN @otree8 @jbpesnell @Cbtide @07HannahB I'll come but I'll have to leave early. When and where is this going down?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 01:57:44	@j_MCTWiN @otree8 @jbpesnell @Cbtide @07HannahB I get off work tomorrow at 4. Just keep me informed.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-01 12:56:03	Trying to get up and motivated for work today. It's a slow process as always.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-01 16:34:13	Well it's official. I'm sick. Shit.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-02 01:28:47	@cchapman25 I have no idea what this crap is. I've been sweating out my fever. I'll be glad when I'm a hundred percent again.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-02 01:31:51	@cchapman25 I'm feeling a little better now. Eating some soup.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-01 18:03:24	@AStormMcCann thanks for almost inciting a craxy ex riot last night. Haha
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-01 18:04:37	I feel like freeze dried asshole. I hate being sick.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-02 18:27:41	Feeling much better than yesterday, but I have no energy. At least my appetite is back.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-02 19:04:04	What's the best thing about being sick? Watching #TopGear on BBC. What's worse? Wanting to be active and not being able to be. :/

372862942	J_moe223	2013-05-31 02:32:54	@j_MCTWiN @jbpesnell @otree8 @07HannahB ok, sounds good to me.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-05 01:57:09	@ElizaJHolley only 90% of the time we think that. Haha
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-04 00:32:26	I find that I have a higher tolerance for douchebags now. Not sure if I'm just accepting it, or letting them get away with it.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-04 00:36:20	Commenting on my last tweet.....if I don't pay attention to them it's like they don't even exist. It's hard ignoring a douche though.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-05 13:10:34	@Jamie_Wisdom Happy Birthday!
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-05 13:12:06	@MaryHall13 I'm proud of this Walking Dead reference.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-04 01:32:26	Sam Elliott's narration of Dodge commercials does the same thing that Morgan Freeman's does for movies. #epic
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-06 20:02:55	@cchapman25 I haven't been since I was a kid. Everyone should go at least once. I want to go back.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-04 02:48:49	@andrew_cooper37 @Ozier_DaRoo you must have forgot to go fuck yourself. Good thing I'm here to remind you. #govols #truefriendhere

372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-06 20:14:31	@B_Reediculous I work until 10 tomorrow night. If you do your 21st b-day right you'll be retarded by the time I get there. #alcoholpoisoning
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-06 23:09:15	@B_Reediculous your hangover is going to be epic. You had better start drinking at noon tomorrow. Jack Daniels is going to skull fuck you.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-03 03:33:26	Just watched the new episode of Game of Thrones tonight and I'm very upset. I'm a glass case of emotion right now! #gameofthrones
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-07 01:31:17	Now I'm reminded why I never come to the Max Fitness on Cox Creek Parkway. There's more douchebags here than on a feminine hygiene isle.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-07 01:42:37	@ElizaJHolley the downtown one isn't 24 hours but I like the atmosphere there better.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-07 01:43:02	@ElizaJHolley there are some douchebags there but it's not as bad.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-07 02:10:24	@j_MCTWiN going out for a friend's b-day tomorrow night after I get off work. You and @dut614 should come out!

372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-07 03:00:48	@cchapman25 oh, me too. I say random words though. Skittles! Bacon! Shit ass! It's a mild form of turrets.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-07 03:05:49	@cchapman25 except right now. Can't sleep.

372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-08 12:59:25	I was wide awake at 6am. Feeling fan-damn-tastic! Time to get this day started! #feelinggood
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-05 00:11:58	Ok ladies, sometimes when a guy smiles and says hi he is more than likely just being nice. #calmyourtits
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-04 17:14:48	There are a few things in life that I'm not proud of. Like farting and blaming it on old people or pregnant women. #judgeme
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-06 13:22:39	I'm feeling the need to go on a road trip soon. Doesn't matter where to. Maybe the Jack Daniels museum/distillery. Who's in?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-09 13:31:29	The day I'm off work it would be raining. I had alcohol and ambitions of enjoying the river today. #damn

372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-09 22:22:27	That awkward moment when you have to poop but you're afraid of the nasty public restrooms. Really blunt tweet. Yes. #sorrynotsorry
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-09 22:46:20	Some of the worst acting people I've ever seen are the ones who go eat at a restaurant after church. #rude #hateful #ignorant #badmanners

372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-10 01:33:57	@jbpesnell it's an amazing show!
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-10 01:36:07	@MaryHall13 quit tweeting about it! We're recording and then watching it when we eat! #shhhh
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-10 02:04:08	@MaryHall13 eh...I know them already. Haha
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-07 19:01:35	I show up to work an hour early for the second time this week. Too bad I can't clock in yet.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-10 04:46:49	Listening to it rain always clears my head. #calming
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-11 15:39:45	Well I'm not taking summer classes anymore. Waiting to finish up in the fall and spring semesters. Then I'll be a college graduate!
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-11 19:32:55	Who's up for watching Man of Steel this weekend with me? We will consume alcoholic beverages before we watch it. #goodtimes
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-11 21:59:38	Since I'm not going to class this summer I'll need to earn some extra money. I may have to whore myself out. #dowhatyagottado
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-12 03:35:16	@dut614 different but not exactly what I was thinking of.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-12 13:00:50	Some people have the uncanny ability to talk out of their ass all of the time.

372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-12 23:32:56	@otree8 just making sure I have a spot reserved for Saturday.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-11 15:29:50	One selfie every once in a while is ok. 1-2 a week...I'll let that slide. One or more every day? You're just an attention whore. #juststop

372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-12 03:32:50	I need to take a trip to somewhere different. Where the hell should I go to though. The beach? Mountains? #needavacation
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-16 01:41:37	I got a little burnt today. Maybe I should invest in some Jersey shore clothing to go along with my bright reddish/orange color. #GTL

372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-18 05:41:49	I like it when it thunderstorms. Even when it sounds like it's getting pretty rough outside. I always find it to be calming.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-18 22:30:22	I'm hosting a get together at my place. I have chicken and a grill. So that means that you'll have to supply everything else. It will be fun
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-19 00:13:18	@MaryHall13 what's the catch?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-19 01:32:13	@Cbtide you're too badass to workout. You walk in doing the Hulkamania intro.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-17 15:50:31	@otree8 yeah! Reading Shakespeare and pounding beers.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-18 03:47:52	An ice cold beer after a long day cures all. #millatime
372862942	J_moe223	2013-06-18 22:12:24	I haven't accomplished a damn thing today except for read and go to the gym. It has been good day.

372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-25 17:32:12	@JackieSpence1 wasn't really a subtweet. Your tweet was one of many about OTR last night. It appears that I missed out on good times.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-25 17:36:02	@JackieSpence1 I thought it was something hardcore like that. I drank $1.00 Natural Lights and had old man talk at Sam's. #hardcore
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-25 20:22:46	If you put "#toougly" in your tweet and you're very pretty, you should be struck down with leprosy. Everyone knows better (you included).
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-26 15:29:57	@shelbycsmith people said the same thing when Heath Ledger was cast as the joker. At least give it a chance.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-26 15:32:30	@shelbycsmith The Town and Argo were really good. Both written and directed by Affleck. The new batman will be written by Christopher Nolan.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-26 15:34:34	@shelbycsmith also, it's being directed by Zac Schneider who directed 300 and Man of Steel.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-26 15:37:08	@shelbycsmith that's all I'm asking. Lol
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-26 17:51:45	@MaryHall13 I heard that they're swingers.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-27 11:49:29	Work at 7, class at 12:30, library, and the gym. I lead an exciting life. #nevergrowup #ItsaTrap
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-26 00:57:35	5 minutes until a new episode of @BreakingBad_AMC ! #hellyeah
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-26 02:08:00	Screw the VMA's. That @BreakingBad_AMC episode was epic!
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-26 19:49:23	@MaryHall13 just letting ya know!
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-29 01:21:07	@cchapman25 in response to your racist comment earlier. http://t.co/nGvKglKLhh
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-26 23:35:34	Look at me...being responsible and going to the library to study. Shit...
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-27 01:19:36	It's really hard to be productive with all that drum beating outside of the library.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-27 03:11:01	I don't have anything to tweet about. No relationship, school work is done, and I'm content right now. Well....@BBC_TopGear is on. Yeah...
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-27 18:56:07	I want this! http://t.co/QLITPYx28Y
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-28 02:10:21	@B_Reediculous I know you're a grown up now and have responsibilities, but can we go partake of the $1.00 draft Natural Lights at Sam's?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-28 02:10:55	@B_Reediculous soon as in whenever neither of us are busy?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-28 02:41:11	@B_Reediculous football starts this Saturday. Let's get some people together and go.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-28 02:45:44	@B_Reediculous who is and isn't allowed to come? I assume everyone is invited unless stated otherwise.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-27 18:47:31	If someone buys me the season 3 special edition blu-ray set of The Walking Dead I'll love you forever. It has floating zombie heads. #EPIC

372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-30 11:29:04	@Ozier_DaRoo hell lets plan a trip to one of the games.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-30 16:22:48	The majority of the people at the Math department at UNA are nice. However, there are a few condescending cunt biscuits. #venting
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-28 11:40:27	@kendjohn is this drunk tweeting? Because that's a great 80's movie. Haha
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-30 18:50:03	@cchapman25 which one?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-28 15:57:29	Well I was enjoying this book before people starting screaming on campus.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-28 20:23:17	@kendjohn haha I thought you were drunk tweeting. It's a great movie.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-31 06:04:51	I just got woken up by 2 drunk friends of mine that I served with. Not even a little upset I got woken up. Great hearing from those fuckers.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-28 21:15:55	Today has been an awesome day. #NoWorries
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-28 21:30:04	These 2 Asian students walked by saying random English words and phrases in an excited tone. #DayMade #Hilarious
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-28 22:17:02	@cchapman25 you would've laughed too. #dontbullshit
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-31 13:03:42	It's college game day! Wooo!

372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-02 18:17:01	I would rather be napping during this storm than going to work.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-30 00:03:16	Let me apologize in advance for any inappropriate behavior I may display during football season this year. #apologies #Football #GoVols
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-30 00:13:39	@Cbtide I don't really hate you, but I'm feeling the need to superman punch you in the taint.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-30 00:19:29	@Cbtide well I still love ya. We need to hangout and watch some football this year.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-30 02:42:25	Who's down for going to either Nashville or Knoxville one weekend? Knoxville for a football game or Nashville just to have fun.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-30 03:39:02	@Ozier_DaRoo I can't go this weekend. I would like to go soon though.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-30 03:46:37	@Ozier_DaRoo Nice. What games?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-01 21:48:30	This day has been filled with homework, naps, and movies. Not a bad day. Ready for @BreakingBad_AMC tonight!
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-01 23:02:53	"@SteveStfler: I remember august like it was yesterday"
372862942	J_moe223	2013-08-30 04:07:40	@Ozier_DaRoo that's awesome. I want to go to Knoxville or go with some people uo to Nashville soon.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-02 02:04:38	Breaking Bad gets crazier with each new episode! Thank God I still have The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones  to watch when this show ends.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-02 13:29:17	What a surprise.... it's crowded as shit at the max fitness gym on cox creek since they closed the one downtown.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-02 14:32:39	@mollieflan15 I heard several different reasons. The rent was too much at the downtown location.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-02 14:36:54	@mollieflan15 they're moving some of the equipment from the other gym to cox creek but it will still be bad.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-05 09:37:07	Well, time to get up and get shit done. Why am I up so early? I hate crowded gyms. Oh, I think I may be a little retarded too. #earlybird
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-05 12:34:59	That's it. I'm looking for a new gym. Max Fitness is garbage. Don't waste your time or money there. Too crowded and not enough equipment.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-05 15:09:51	What time is kickoff for the UNA game?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-05 15:32:42	@Mary_Frann Sweet. I'll be back in time for it.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-05 15:40:15	@otree8 All I've ever said is I hate gym pics, douche attitudes, and straight up assholes. Oh, and to not waste your time at Max.

372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-03 22:47:33	@Jamie_Wisdom not if you're just running. I think you MIGHT be ok.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-03 22:54:45	@Jamie_Wisdom did you not even get to workout?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-06 00:35:09	All of a sudden....a headache hits me. #WellShit
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-03 23:37:30	@Jamie_Wisdom I just left like 4 minutes ago. It has thinned out some.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-04 01:58:28	I feel like going out and being social. Then I remember it's Tuesday and I have shit to do tomorrow.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-06 23:44:03	@JackieSpence1 are you going to the game tomorrow?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-04 03:45:33	Ok, since I can't sleep I'm planning a trip to Nashville. Seriously. I Need to get out of Florence. Drama free non-whiney people accepted.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-04 03:55:09	@j_MCTWiN haha not much. Just school and work really.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-06 12:37:20	I didn't even drink last night and it feels like I have a hangover. Damn headache.

372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-06 16:45:42	@Leah_Michelle8 did you apply to Gander?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-06 16:57:40	@Leah_Michelle8 Apply. Wouldn't hurt.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-06 17:00:32	@erikanbaxter @Leah_Michelle8 Apply everywhere. Have you looked at lion jobs?
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-07 02:47:35	Looks like I'm going out after all.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-07 02:52:58	@JackieSpence1 I have some friends that are going. I want to go but I know I'll be broke if I do.

372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-03 03:46:46	All of these sad sappy tweets about relationships and being unhappy. Focus on making yourself happy before trying to find someone to do it.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-03 03:51:23	@JackieSpence1 um... $1.00 Natty's?!
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-03 03:52:59	@JackieSpence1 just making sure you're taking advantage of the Nattys. Can't pass on that shit. Haha

372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-03 04:03:08	Well I guess it's time to be a grown-up (I use that term lightly) and go to bed. I have to be productive tomorrow.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-04 15:27:24	@Cbtide that's more like it.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-03 12:49:54	I don't have class until 12:30. I better leave now so I get decent parking spot.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-03 12:52:35	@oliviamhill thanks for making me feel even better...
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-03 14:23:23	@JackieSpence1 wow. That sucks. Glad to know they're doing their best to help out with all this building construction and no parking.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-03 14:55:08	To the guy who took up 2 side street parking spots, did you parallel park with your head up your ass? All the room in the world.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-03 15:20:43	@cchapman25 I live no where near campus. No bus comes by anywhere near my house. If I walked I wouldn't get anything done.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-03 15:23:22	@cchapman25 I promote that people use common sense while parking and driving. Don't take up two parking spaces. Be considerate of others.

372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-15 11:34:22	I did absolutely nothing last night and it was everything I thought it could be.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-17 15:26:48	I actually didn't have to park 3 miles away from campus today. Woo!
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-17 18:31:18	@kelseywoodman those days are also known as margarita Monday, wine down Wednesday, thirsty Thursday, and of course the weekend. #hereforyou
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-17 18:32:18	@prt4usc I'm reading A Storm of Swords now. I downloaded the first 4 books.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-17 18:33:43	@kelseywoodman! There's also "turn up" Tuesday but I refuse to actually say those words.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-17 18:35:54	@prt4usc it's amazing! I read the Red Wedding chapter last week. I had to take a break after reading it. It depressed me all over again.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-17 18:41:19	@kelseywoodman "turn up" should only be used when asking for the music to be louder and for an increase in TV volume.

372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-17 00:39:17	@samantha_leighd I also forgot about the ones that I didn't buy for you. It was your b-day! Each one gets worse...uh, I mean better! Haha

372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-20 11:54:55	@JackieSpence1 it's allowed because you have to close to a Wal-Mart in order to refill up on ammo, beer, and Red Man chewing tobacco.
372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-20 13:33:03	So that exam is over with. Power nap time!

372862942	J_moe223	2013-09-30 00:18:36	@cchapman25 plus they don't give you the full recipe for meth. Cops even tell people what's in meth to keep people from using it.

372862942	J_moe223	2014-01-15 19:32:14	Oh look...I missed out on another pretty day. Glad that happened. Said no one ever.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-01-20 20:34:36	Out 76 pictures you have 21 that aren't selfies. Yes, I did count and yes it bothers me. However, 55 selfies? Really? Come on now....
372862942	J_moe223	2014-01-20 20:53:23	@ElizaJHolley Oh, I'm not running after it. I just saw it and said, "Wow, she has a lot of selfies, and I never see her post anything else."
372862942	J_moe223	2014-01-20 20:57:32	@ElizaJHolley My first thought was, "Hey, she's pretty but wait...there are a lot of selfies! " #Selfabsorbed
372862942	J_moe223	2014-01-22 12:35:55	So my friend Phil got a large Rapala lure hooked into his face at work last night. My response? "Dude, there's a fucking hook in your face!"
372862942	J_moe223	2014-01-22 12:37:12	I feel like my response to the fishing hook in his face was an expected and logical response. #justsaying

372862942	J_moe223	2014-01-24 21:13:07	I'll be spending some serious quality time with the hammock in my yard when the weather gets warmer.

372862942	J_moe223	2014-01-28 12:10:40	It's sad when you have to watch BBC world news in order to get real news. I couldn't give a shit about celebrities and the dumb shit they do

372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-08 14:55:33	So @RadioBrentReed and I did a double take at the same time when we saw each other last night. It was #epic.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-08 15:01:40	I've come to the sad conclusion that I just can't hack it anymore when it comes to even having a few beers and staying up late. #oldman
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-10 01:06:23	Looking forward to spending time with some good military friends of mine for Veterans Day. Pic is actually 10 yrs old http://t.co/ZgBNtQWOWN
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-10 01:08:16	@erikanbaxter @KNEEnerr @JamieWisdom1 is Cracker Barrel doing anything for Veterans Day? I'd rather eat at where you all are working.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-10 01:30:25	@JamieWisdom1 haha no worries. Thought I'd just ask. There's always a free meal and one free beer at wild wings. #winninganyways
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-09 12:44:33	Oatmeal and some sports center before work. Let's get this day started.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-10 16:30:11	I'm eating with one or two of my military buddies tomorrow. We like having company, so feel free to join us even if you aren't a vet.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-10 03:43:14	@KNEEnerr haha no worries. I get to eat free at some places but I still tip. Would rather tip one of y'all.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-11 15:50:30	@Cbtide miss you buddy
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-11 16:13:05	@Cbtide thanks man. We'll have tobge together and eat soon.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-11 16:14:20	@Cbtide to get together*
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-11 16:19:32	@Cbtide @otree8 I'm not involved with this. I love and miss all my friends.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-11 16:38:09	@Cbtide I'm at the gym right now. I'll swing by and say hi though.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-11 17:30:46	The great part about Veterans Day is getting texts and phone calls from friends that you served with years ago.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-11 18:19:21	The people I served with is what I miss the most. This pic brings back a lot of memories. This was my Senior Chief. http://t.co/Yspydeu1Df
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-11 13:10:37	Happy Veterans Day to all of my brothers and sisters who have served and are still serving in all branches. http://t.co/KnSr7Edn5F
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-13 18:38:31	I just heard a radio ad saying that P.J.'s in Muscle Shoals was "cleaner and classier." I was a witness and these are lies.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-14 14:32:00	Happy Birthday @shelbycsmith
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-14 14:33:58	@shelbycsmith cool story. Hope you age with grace. :)
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-14 14:35:46	@shelbycsmith if you're lucky.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-14 16:15:17	Be careful what you say about someone's military service. Not everyone had the same job, but if they deployed they still did more than you.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-14 16:18:11	People say the most horrendous shit during or around military holidays. I don't understand. This is in reference to my last tweet.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-14 16:58:07	@otree8 no, I'm talking about "tough guys" who talk shit because they feel like their man hood is in question. The "I could've joined" guys.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-14 17:03:13	@otree8 or the ones who did serve and talk nonsensical shit about other branches. I say just respect what people do. Civilian or military.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-14 17:12:00	@otree8 almost forgot. #gymtweet
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-13 15:29:38	I'm trying to grow a beard, and by that I mean I'm making an attempt at having minor facial hair.

372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-17 04:14:06	Why are people worried about where I'm going, who I'm with, and how many and/or when my off days are? I'm a 29 yr old vet. Gossiping bitches
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-17 04:24:22	@Hall_NoOates haha it's not about you.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-17 04:25:37	I don't even know if who I'm thinking about has a Twitter. Lol
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-17 13:39:03	@otree8 thanks? #bro
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-17 20:24:07	Saw this guy wearing a hoodie saying, "Eat pussy, chug whiskey, hail Satan." #WTF
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-21 15:27:55	My heat is fixed but I'm still angry that it's cold out.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-21 16:10:00	@otree8 @dut614 never mind on the whiskey and cigars Saturday night.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-21 16:11:48	@ThaRealestOG Extreme Fitness has tanning beds.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-21 16:15:11	@ThaRealestOG Yes. It's 24 hours too.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-21 16:16:18	@ThaRealestOG no problem. They're stand up tanning beds but I really don't know if there's any difference.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-21 17:40:01	@dut614 @otree8 sorry man. I have to work thanksgiving so I need to visit family.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-21 18:15:37	@Ozier_DaRoo @ThaRealestOG I know because I workout there. #DontJudgeMe
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-21 20:04:08	@otree8 @dut614 I apologized. Lol
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-21 20:13:23	@otree8 @dut614 hey man...It's family.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-21 20:22:39	@otree8 @dut614 well if I get back in time we'll do something, brother. When I go to Tennessee I'll grandma you said hi.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-20 23:15:24	Shut up, get up, be positive, and work for what you want.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-19 13:33:57	Our heat is broken. I wake up cold and super angry every morning.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-21 01:56:54	@otree8 @dut614 cigars and whiskey Saturday night.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-22 14:49:00	19 years ago today Toy Story premiered. Damn I feel old as shit now.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-22 15:13:54	I just want to get to where I can travel again. I'm talking about over seas travel.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-22 19:25:58	@dut614 @otree8 I never get to wear a suit. I was proud. Lol
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-24 17:51:16	Whenever I tell people my age they laugh and say, "No..."  #imagrownman #damnit

372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-23 03:52:23	You know who cares about Harvard and Yale football. Harvard amd Yale. That's it. No one cares.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-25 05:01:28	Don't delete your whole post when people prove you wrong. Stand by what you said and leave it. Oh "brave" Facebook posters...
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-25 05:04:33	My last tweet is not in regards to anything said about the Ferguson verdict. It was on a completely different subject.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-25 05:19:01	Burning the flag of the country where men and women of all races died is disgraceful. It helps nothing and does nothing for your cause.

372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-26 15:29:18	Warning: another military rant, sorry. However, if you're fresh out of boot camp and have never deployed anywhere. SHUT THE FUCK UP.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-26 15:38:33	Tired of seeing people fresh out of boot camp with their one service ribbon making duck faces with a gun. Show the uniform some respect.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-26 02:28:21	A friendly reminder for the holidays and for Black Friday. http://t.co/4wscynbS0c
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-26 04:08:51	"He says things without thinking sometimes, but he doesn't mean to." Invalid excuse. That's what people say about mentally challenged people
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-26 04:14:49	I'm craving Blue Coast Burrito at 10:13pm. Is that a step up from Taco Hell? #MovinOnUp

372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-26 21:39:35	If you're missing any whole cooked chickens, my dogs have them. They got out and stole them from someone. #HappyThanksgiving
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-27 23:33:33	I gave away all of my desserts because I'm trying not to cheat even a little. #imdumb #needpumpkinpie
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-27 23:39:28	Whoever my dogs keep stealing food from: A.I'm sorry. B. It does look delicious C. Can you blame them?
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-28 19:38:40	My dryer is broke. Any of my friends care if I use their washer and dryer?
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-30 02:10:45	I go to pick up food and hear sounds of laughter and cheering. Angry that I'm missing out on football. #lame
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-30 15:07:07	I woke up and saw a bottle of fireball sitting on the counter. It's 9am and I wanted a swig of it. #noshame
372862942	J_moe223	2014-11-29 17:03:38	Well I'm missing out on good football tonight. Again....
372862942	J_moe223	2014-12-01 13:56:00	Nobody can ever accuse me of not paying my debts. That's for damn sure.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-12-01 03:20:22	Kids, take fantasy football seriously. When you lose....this happens. #FantasyFootball #cashbowl #ilost http://t.co/Taqe9JRz5l
372862942	J_moe223	2014-12-01 03:30:52	@otree8 I lost man. I'm not happy about this.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-12-01 03:36:07	@otree8 I knew you would be theb one making this loss and punishment worse. #truefriend
372862942	J_moe223	2014-12-01 03:42:32	@otree8 @dut614 you guys are really helping out with this fantasy football punishment.
372862942	J_moe223	2014-12-03 01:40:10	How many people does it take to spot someone who is obviously lifting too much? Everyone. The answer is everyone. @otree8 gym tweet 12/2/14

372862942	J_moe223	2014-12-03 02:15:11	@otree8 hey, I promised I'd tag you. I mainly do it for your reaction and endless tweets. In 2015 there might not be any gym tweets.#sadtree

372862942	J_moe223	2014-12-03 16:16:33	Can you really call people "thirsty" when you post a million half naked selfies, and you're surprised by the attention? #GiveMeABreak
372862942	J_moe223	2014-12-03 13:57:26	I was just informed that some new jeans look like "mom jeans." Since I'm ignorant when it comes to style, I don't know what this is.

372862942	J_moe223	2014-12-07 23:38:31	I took a douchebag mirror selfie as a punishment for losing in fantasy football. Some people do it simply because it's Sunday. #JustStop

372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-16 16:13:51	@otree8 I'm off work today too but I'm going to the gym #gymtweet #youvemissedmytweets
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-16 18:08:23	If you're working today, I apologize. If you're off work today you should be enjoying this weather in some sort of way. #SpringIsHERE
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-18 01:02:20	Not going to lie. I feel a trip to Hooters coming soon.
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-18 03:35:11	I heard someone say, "It's ok, I dated someone who served in (insert branch)." After they said something insulting. What a fucktard. #WTF
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-18 03:44:17	@kevinmark20 @TigerKing009 #soybeanwind makes 3 million a year and that's not including t-shirts and other endorsements. #WakeUp
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-20 01:00:48	Keeping it simple tonight with March Madness and beer.
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-21 01:14:00	I'm so old now that I'm more excited for @MegRS and @_HayHay3 birthday celebration than I was for my own. #TooOldForThisShit
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-21 02:21:39	If you idolize someone who makes duck faces or thug face in their pictures, I have no use for you. #sorrynotsorry
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-21 03:04:50	Having a huge crawfish boil soon. I am beyond excited for this.
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-22 02:03:04	@_HayHay3 @MegRS  what time does the party start? I'm wearing my old man party pants with suspenders. #waypastmybedtime
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-22 02:18:50	@MegRS I may swing by before the bar.
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-21 03:48:41	Heard someone say "raw dog it." Inappropriate for any public setting.  Also, eww... #HelloImARedflag
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-20 23:46:45	Everyone is entitled to their opinion on sports, politics, and religion. When they express it in an ignorant way is when I ignore them.
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-23 00:11:44	I'm craving Buffalo Wild Wings, beer, and March Madness. #SundayFunday #lazyday  #bored
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-24 01:31:09	I'm thinking that I need another trip to Nashville or Birmingham soon.
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-25 02:56:22	I need good friends and margaritas in my life ASAP.
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-25 03:03:35	@oliviamhill when you get old you allowed to crave margaritas. #judgeme
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-25 03:03:52	@oliviamhill you're* damn it. Lol
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-25 21:35:16	If anyone wondered, I chose to take down the post about  my mom on Facebook. Good intentioned people were stressing her out.
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-27 02:13:19	There's a fine line between being full of confidence and full of shit. #truth
372862942	J_moe223	2015-03-28 20:55:25	Mom was in good spirits today despite her pain. That woman could teach a few people lessons in strength and dignity. That also includes me.
372862942	J_moe223	2015-04-01 22:31:24	If you date someone that you know lies about almost everything, what do you think they'll do with you? #ThinkingOutLoud #truth
372862942	J_moe223	2015-04-28 01:10:40	I haven't felt this good in a long damn time. #noworries #feelinggood
372862942	J_moe223	2015-05-03 16:04:17	Family, friends, beautiful day, good food, and The Avengers tonight? #hellsyeah #summer
372862942	J_moe223	2015-05-03 17:30:36	@MegRS @lindzi12 I'm an eno hammock enthusiast now. I need fellow "hammockers" today to join me.
372862942	J_moe223	2015-05-03 19:57:28	@MegRS @lindzi12 no worries. I'm an eno person now so I'll be out here hammock in it up. Haha
372862942	J_moe223	2015-05-08 12:54:00	Anyone heard of having to have a pet permit for a dog in Florence, AL? The dogs have tags and are registered with up to date shots.
372862942	J_moe223	2015-05-10 15:48:59	Happy Mother's Day to my amazing mom who has always been there for me. #HappyMothersDay http://t.co/6VA4uvvJDl
372862942	J_moe223	2015-05-23 00:32:56	Telling everyone how smart you are is like a douchebag at the gym telling everyone how much weight they can lift. #noonecares #learnhumility
372862942	J_moe223	2015-06-15 12:50:33	Now I'm wishing that Olly had been killed off by the wildlings in season 4. #GameOfThronesSeason5 #GameofThrones
372862942	J_moe223	2015-06-16 02:49:09	Need more friends like @otree8 who makes fun of everyone equally. He's an equal opportunistic meanie. #bro #hemissesmygymtweets
