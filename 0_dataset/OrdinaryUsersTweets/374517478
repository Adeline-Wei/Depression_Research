374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-08 15:09:42	@VTIME_1 @gtate10 you have no room to talk lol Ohio State almost got beat by Northwestern. Georgia has beaten 2 top ten teams.
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-08 15:12:01	@gtate10 @VTIME_1 haha seriously Ohio State doesn't play anybody. They'd easily lose 2 games in the SEC
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-08 15:17:22	@gtate10 @VTIME_1 you got that right. A mediocre team from the SEC is equal to a top team from any other division, in my opinion
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-08 15:21:17	@gtate10 @VTIME_1 for sure, I think maybe 10 out of the 14 teams in the SEC could. They could at least play with them.
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-08 15:28:02	@gtate10 @VTIME_1 definitely. I know they'd lose a couple though. The SEC is too tough
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-11 20:24:46	Road the bike today for the first time since my surgery!
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-12 19:02:04	It's always seems like my feet are either below zero degrees or 1,000 degrees and I hate it

374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-17 03:06:12	@d_rayman I'm gonna start writing letters instead
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-17 13:36:13	It's getting harder and harder not being able to play the best game on earth. It just motivates me though
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-17 02:47:32	I've grown to dislike texting
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-15 01:40:01	There's nothing better than seeing progress
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-19 19:56:54	Days like today show us how good the SEC really is
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-19 23:48:50	@Deuce1042 @J_Doggy_Dog yeah they would still be up there if they didn't have their top 2 running backs, top 3 receivers out. Plus more
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-19 23:35:01	Yet again, shows how tough the SEC is!
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-19 23:39:26	@Deuce1042 the SEC is still the toughest conference in football. No other conference comes close
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-19 23:52:18	@Deuce1042 and they won 2 out of those 3 then they lost all their playmakers
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-19 01:44:39	If the Cardinals and Red Sox are playing in the World Series I won't watch it. I can't stand them both
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-19 01:49:15	@JustThomp haha, as much as I love baseball I couldn't bring myself to watch them. I'd rather watch paint dry
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-19 23:44:17	@J_Doggy_Dog @Deuce1042 SEC has 8 teams in the top 25 deservedly
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-20 03:58:17	Ole Miss beats LSU. What a crazy day in the SEC! Toughest conference in the nation!
374517478	Crumdawg17	2013-10-20 19:10:16	I just want to be back to normal
