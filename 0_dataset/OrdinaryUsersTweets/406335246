406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-01 20:40:06	@JoshBland13 definitely, ive thought for a while now that barca are hugely overrated and this had just been proved.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-01 20:45:03	@JoshBland13 I agree, however I prefer dortmund, bayern defy the german model, miles richer than everyone else
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-01 20:51:17	@JoshBland13 its the PL! Won't be so manchester orientated next year, chelsea for the league! Serie A lacks the quality atm @RichBanbrook35
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-01 20:52:57	Where exactly does Gotze fit in the bayern side?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-01 21:34:38	actually revised like a god tonight #bossingit
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-04-30 21:26:57	fed up of this now.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-04-30 21:27:39	@JoshBland13 something about who he was joining &amp; ITV cutting him off? #amateurs.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-04-30 21:36:38	@JoshBland13 cheers man - means a lot
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-04-30 21:49:57	lol my music is too depressing haha,
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-03 15:35:12	looks like we wont be getting a season ticket next season then :(
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-03 15:41:36	@RichBanbrook35 yeah same, absolute joke
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-02 16:27:11	sick of school now. #leavemealone
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-01 17:33:35	Can see pulis leaving stoke having a similar effect to what happened at charlton with curbishley. They don't appreciate how lucky they are
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-01 18:09:43	What are the odds of barca progressing? #worthacheekyquid
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-02 19:39:37	@elysia_lind what's up?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-02 20:08:37	@elysia_lind cheer up! #itsallgravybaby
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-02 20:20:18	@elysia_lind i completely understand. guessing its not the time for #turnthatfrownupsidedown then?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-02 20:29:29	Andy townsend is a complete knob.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-02 20:29:47	@elysia_lind I think I'm gonna go ahead and stop
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-02 20:34:15	@elysia_lind yeah I agree, think I may just about have got away with this one
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-03 20:40:12	http://t.co/Wj0Mt1jNro how true
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-03 20:49:25	@gurdeep_kaur1 @JoshBland13 alright gurdeep leave off the abuse yeah? ;)
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-03 21:00:15	wow, realised i havent read last weeks FFT yet #behind #busybusy
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-03 21:01:18	or month even
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-02 20:59:14	Mr brightside is a stupidly good song #tune
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-03 22:13:52	@JoshBland13 &lt;3 i understand, trust me :p
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-03 22:14:49	@ChrisTheChippie -_- fuck you! #citytillidie
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-03 22:15:28	@JoshBland13 sames, shit sorts itself out, i promise:)
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-03 22:18:25	@JoshBland13 haha yeah i know, i just realised that -_- #ohwell
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-04 13:24:17	@ZerkaaHD getting worried?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-04 14:28:41	gutted leicester got in the play offs and huddersfield stayed up :(
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-06 13:04:48	oh god i feel so ill :(
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-06 14:31:56	@jackm_jarvis imagine what that will be like for me!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-06 15:00:42	@jackm_jarvis I feel bad hoping that they lose the final!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-06 15:04:05	@jackm_jarvis in fairness swindon are the best side, I hope brentford cause of what happened the other week
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-06 16:32:55	@jackm_jarvis yeah, could still go either way though
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-06 18:21:12	Well don't brentford, done brilliantly not to bottle it after last weeks events #congratulations
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-05 12:12:56	What a tie this is! #league2
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-05 12:13:43	We will take that maghoma! #skyblues
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-05 13:07:06	@RichBanbrook35 yeah he would do a job. As would zola, we need a big lad next year so we don't get bullied
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-05 13:26:52	@RichBanbrook35 fair point, or we hope for good old preston haskell -_- #pipedream
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-06 21:25:09	what's even the point.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 19:48:04	Yes, come on Wigan!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 19:55:48	Woop Woop, get in the McCarthy! #wigan #stayingup
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 20:48:11	@wilbur999 everyone likes wigan though! I would prefer sunderland if its any consolation?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 21:05:01	@wilbur999 yeah think villa have just enough unfortuantely, although wigan are in real trouble now.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-10 08:46:51	Theres no point holding discussions with fans, we either stay in Coventry, or the club loses 99% of its support. #simples
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-06 15:06:37	@jackm_jarvis its at brentford though isn't it? Its gonna be close..
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-06 15:23:48	@jackm_jarvis really? Its all depends how what happened last week affects brentfords players
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-06 15:29:42	@jackm_jarvis yeah I would fancy them unless it goes to penalties :p haha you should, my tweets are genius!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-06 15:42:33	@jackm_jarvis surely not? Imagine if he missed it! Haha good lad!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-06 16:04:50	@jackm_jarvis haha but you never know with peno's. That would really kill him if he missed another
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 16:59:54	Petition Keep City in Coventry http://t.co/JYQQXRM1wQ via @ipetitions
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 17:38:47	Finally stopped coughing! :D
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 17:55:45	@aisha_semi yeah if possible?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 17:56:04	@aisha_semi no seriously its a big deal, you should have heard me today -_-
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 17:59:46	@aisha_semi yeah, and the last 4 weeks
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 18:04:18	@aisha_semi yeah I know its ridiculous haha,
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 18:07:07	@aisha_semi yeah going again tomorrow, really don't need this during exams -_-
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 18:19:33	@aisha_semi haha I know, might have to sit in another room
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 18:25:39	@aisha_semi not my fault!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 18:31:46	@aisha_semi I cannot be blamed for this...
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 18:38:15	@aisha_semi whose fault is it then?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-07 18:42:29	@aisha_semi fair point,  what a joke.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 12:31:07	Agbonlahor is a dirty cheat #scum
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 17:37:28	Fellaini will surely be off to united now.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 17:47:08	@EddJoyner no way! Hey buddy!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 17:47:45	@jackm_jarvis they do desperately need a CM though? Its weird I thought fellaini would be the more likely bet to join
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 17:53:53	@jackm_jarvis no, but perhaps they need someone different to sit alongside carrick, cause their midfield doesn't score enough goals
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 17:54:23	@EddJoyner don't worry mate you'll get used to it, its so much better than fb, cause you can #hashtag
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 18:00:00	@jackm_jarvis it depends if they sell rooney, as they can afford to let a striker go and then strengthen in other areas
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 18:29:57	@jackm_jarvis I would guess at either PSG or man city
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 15:03:04	well done Frank Lampard #respect #legend
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 18:35:08	@jackm_jarvis not sure whether he would suit anything other than english football
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 18:53:59	@jackm_jarvis yeah, such a waste of time, hate players who give up competitive football for cash
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 18:59:17	@jackm_jarvis exactly so annoying, you are right with all of them plus asamoah gyan what was that about?!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 19:11:55	@jackm_jarvis absolute disgrace, such a stupid decision, apparently he wants a move now
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 19:18:43	@jackm_jarvis he can't be as good anymore either if you're not teating yourself, surely he can't improve?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 19:19:35	Fuck off leicester #comeonwatford
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 19:26:00	@JoshBland13 just found this! #englishbanter http://t.co/uZh5b4nKVS
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 19:32:36	@JoshBland13 i know, was we well identified. Him and Platt up front is quite frankly frightening.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 19:33:31	@jackm_jarvis haha good quoting there :p maybe, wouldnt sign him if I was a PL chairman. I'd be taking a look at Bony #tank
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 19:34:54	@jackm_jarvis remy or Bony for you?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 20:02:08	@jackm_jarvis I would go with bony, far cheaper wages, and has the potential to be another drogba
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 20:06:54	@jackm_jarvis no but he is also in a poorer side. I think he has the potential to be a better player than remy
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 20:09:17	@jackm_jarvis do you think? I don't think remy would be that cheap either tbf
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 20:13:46	@jackm_jarvis yeah probably right, would still go with bony though, he could be like benteke next season
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 20:17:05	@jackm_jarvis I would go for him if I was AVB think he would fit perfectly there.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 20:27:01	@jackm_jarvis yeah dont see why he couldnt step up. I would be looking at him or bentekkers
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 20:32:15	@jackm_jarvis he will be very expensive though, especially as they are going to stay up
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 20:34:03	@jackm_jarvis yeah, i know he scored a screamer last night, but adebayor is dog shit
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 20:36:21	@jackm_jarvis he offers barely anything, i dont rate him at all.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 20:38:02	@jackm_jarvis he earns a mega contract- then stops playing.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-09 20:42:19	god damn watford you better turn it round in the home leg and defeat the #inbreds
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 18:12:09	Brilliant, that's what football is all about #beautifulgame
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 18:17:34	Mancini has to go, city have been feeble all season
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 18:19:51	Dave whelan. #whatastory
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 18:25:15	Stories like today give the rest of us true hope #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 18:28:27	Queue all the 'Wigan have one more than arsenal' banter
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 18:33:33	@wilbur999 yeah cant see either of them being there. Perhaps martinez will go to  CIty? well dont worry, im sure we will have to wait longer
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 18:58:30	@JovanDhaliwal yeah man, got to get belief from somewhere -_-
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 19:52:58	@JovanDhaliwal haha its getting there -_-
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 21:02:30	@elysia_lind is it an actual shitty cough? If so I am so sorry -_-
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 21:20:25	@elysia_lind I am so sorry -_- you still have 2 days to recover?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 21:48:14	@elysia_lind can I really be blamed though?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 22:03:17	@elysia_lind yes, but its not as if I intentionally passed it on. i would take a look at your body as the main culprit here.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 22:12:45	@elysia_lind im not so sure, i believe we should share responsibility.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 22:16:13	@elysia_lind oh dear -_- ngl that is very, very unlucky :(
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 22:21:35	@elysia_lind i do genuinely feel quite guilty.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-11 22:26:08	@elysia_lind YOU CAN GET THROUGH THIS! #believe
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-15 10:45:20	@JoshBland13 he is an absolute tank, would be a great signing for you.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-15 13:41:19	Completed the survey. Dont care that they claim, we should not leave this city. #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 15:56:45	@aisha_semi LOL that is a lot of exams!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 15:58:28	@aisha_semi i forgot how many there were! no to be fair i had 7, got two out of the way today, and another 2 tomorrow, nearly halfway ;)
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 15:59:49	probably shouldnt have laughed at this to the extent that I did... http://t.co/J2hB4tWKFw
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 16:00:41	@aisha_semi wow really?! anyway mine are A levels, so they're worth count like 3x more anyway, im gonna go ahead and say its equal.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 16:01:31	@elysia_lind wasnt that exactly what you were hoping was gonna happen to me for weeks? #karmasabitch
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 16:04:10	@elysia_lind i can only hope you get better soon. I feel genuinely quite guilty, but then again its not really my fault so....
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 16:05:29	If exams make you feel like you have hit rock bottom, remind yourself "i could be anthony knockheart" #inbred
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 16:05:57	@elysia_lind @RheannaFayMoore wow someones a bit rude. Is the history exam getting to you?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 16:06:05	@elysia_lind nah im cool thanks.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 16:07:15	@aisha_semi yeah effectively. nah just acknowledging that im an absolute hero with putting up with what im going through.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 16:07:39	@aisha_semi actually no, you have it worse, those 2 maths exams were living hell last year #darkdays
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 16:09:12	@JovanDhaliwal that game has made me so happy, nothing else matters! :D
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 16:11:41	@aisha_semi  if you must know im actually on the road to recovery. oh well done, i got an A by the way, so #boom
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 16:12:10	@JovanDhaliwal one of footballs greatest ever moments. wait watch this:
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 16:13:48	@aisha_semi i got a nice comfy seat at the back today, so every cloud has a silver lining. yeah i know, it is quite an achievement.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 16:15:51	@aisha_semi actually i requested it, cause im a such selfless person. Oh yeah ofc, doesnt get much bigger than AS RS
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 16:18:30	@aisha_semi yeah cheers means a lot. Im not gonna comment, i'll let you know in august..
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 16:19:58	@aisha_semi exactly, thats what im going with, yeah you too for your absolute mass of exams, im sure youll be fine.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 17:26:43	@RichBanbrook35 @JovanDhaliwal it is everything you could ever want in a youtube video
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-12 10:15:07	@SianBath @PriyeshParekh96 @ChrisHobbs96 @EllisDublin @elysia_lind so the chances are it will be management then?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-15 18:18:47	spend 250k on packs, get absolutely nothing #fcheersEA
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-15 19:46:11	@JoshBland13 cardozo is an animal!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-15 21:04:44	@JoshBland13 surely only a matter of time before a move. Spurs perhaps?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-15 21:20:28	@JoshBland13 yeah I agree, a definite possibilty, leaving cardozo free for good old steve carke ;) #pipedreams
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 17:46:16	@JovanDhaliwal do exams have to be brought into every single conversation?

406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 17:55:16	@elysia_lind @RichBanbrook35 @JovanDhaliwal would be hugely beneficial for you to spell #revolution correctly in the exam
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 17:56:05	@RichBanbrook35 also bear in mind #stolypinsneckties to clamp down any other potential revolutionary activity in the countryside
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 17:56:20	@elysia_lind @RichBanbrook35 @JovanDhaliwal if anything im doing you a huge favour
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 17:59:33	@elysia_lind @JovanDhaliwal  im sorry but lets all take step back and realise that our follows just witnessed the gayest thing seen.

406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-12 15:38:59	@BMordey southampton have scored :p
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-12 16:18:57	So that's now kermogant and knockheart #covlegends
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-12 16:41:08	@wilbur999 can't see it happening though, looks like sunderland would go down instead :(
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-12 16:47:52	@wilbur999 can wigan realistically win at the emirates though? I highly doubt it.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-12 17:00:52	The managerial turnover this summer is insane!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-12 17:57:59	@JoshBland13 haha that is brilliant! :')
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-12 18:19:53	http://t.co/XvVAPYpRM6 i love this so much

406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-12 19:12:47	Exams. #bringiton
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-15 20:50:42	@JoshBland13 yep, not that you'd complain if he was playing for your club
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-16 21:45:02	@JoshBland13 brilliant, this will be amazing..
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-12 20:24:35	@PriyeshParekh96 sorry man, doing last minute revision, I was on earlier!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-14 06:28:36	@ChrisHobbs96 it finishes in 8 hours. #nearlythere
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-17 16:18:00	I think peter griffin may be my hero..
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-17 18:04:24	@RichBanbrook35 how can you be box2box, and at the same time have lost your legs??
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-14 18:57:31	That goal just about sums up wigans season
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-16 13:51:28	Great decision to call up Alex McCarthy #topkeeper
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-16 17:28:49	Since Arsene Wenger last won a trophy at Arsenal, all.other 91 English league clubs have changed their manager. Unbelievable.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-16 17:32:38	@youraveragejjoe that wasnt a criticism of arsenal as such, more an observation of how there is no stability at football clubs.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-16 17:33:52	@youraveragejjoe exactly, what im saying :P but disagree, supporting your local club, gives you more enjoyment than any big club could offer
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-16 17:34:25	@youraveragejjoe even if most of the time it is shit, if ever it goes well, it means so much more to the fans.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-16 17:35:34	@youraveragejjoe turst me it does. Arsenal fans are the shittest i have seen, cause they just expect to win, a goal doesnt mean that much.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-16 17:37:22	@youraveragejjoe i did, i have chelsea shirts from when mourinho was last there -_- nah sorry mate its the truth.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-16 17:37:43	@youraveragejjoe the premier league is a company, the real football is down the leagues.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-17 22:13:33	Fuck you sisu, you're a fucking disgrace, ripping out the heart of a football club. You will lose every single fan of this football club.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-14 19:31:40	Come on wigan! #believe #SOTV
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-14 19:47:11	@JoshBland13 it is absolutely brilliant, the best youtube video by a considerable distance
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-14 20:39:15	@RichBanbrook35 i have no idea what you are referring to.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-16 21:30:50	@JoshBland13 link it to me!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-13 14:23:30	@RichBanbrook35 that made me laugh so much! Keep these french midfielders coming!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-14 20:53:34	http://t.co/FrHn9EKcWp this is brilliant!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-14 20:56:50	@RichBanbrook35 i havent yet ruled out the possibility of a late administration, therefore the bet is still active.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-14 21:56:28	@JoshBland13 YES IVE SEEN THIS! love it so much.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-15 14:08:25	that's a really bad TOTW..
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-17 16:09:51	@JoshBland13 sakho from wolves? He would be decent. Surely you'd prefer kone?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-17 17:07:22	@JoshBland13 still think maloney is a waste on the wing. He needs to dictate from a central role.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-17 17:28:56	@RichBanbrook35 why am I the only person who doesn't think gerrard is a holding midfielder?!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 12:47:22	is it bad that i dont want yeovil to get promoted? :(
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 14:17:41	Absolute disgrace that stoke aren't starting owen. Nothing riding on the game, give him a proper farewell. #legend
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 14:37:27	@jackm_jarvis I'm really proud, gary johnson is phenomenal. At the same time, just shows how far we have fallen :(
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 14:40:05	@jackm_jarvis I wanted brentford to win! Its not right that a second team play at a higher level. We need to learn a lot from yeovil.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 14:53:09	@jackm_jarvis its scary how little they have to spend. Madden is on loan from carlisle!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 14:55:31	@jackm_jarvis oh im not sure, you might be right, i must have missed it
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 14:56:47	Hoping for a swing in Tottenham's favour today. COME ON SPURS!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 14:57:08	@jackm_jarvis fair enough, still bet they hardly paid anything for him.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 14:59:32	@jackm_jarvis in fairness, we got leon clarke and blair adams for free, we did some great work in january too. shame about the summer,
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 15:00:43	@jackm_jarvis cough cough MCSHEFFREY cough cough
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 17:43:21	arsenal fans mocking Spurs are pretty pathetic. Must have missed the announcement where 4th place counted as a trophy.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 17:53:31	@youraveragejjoe its not really though, a team like arsenal should get there. So many memes, they're not even funny!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 17:54:14	@youraveragejjoe and that is because the leicester thing was hilarious! http://t.co/UZrPJDEh2B
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 18:03:39	@youraveragejjoe all im saying is finishing 4th for a team like arsenal should not be regarded as an achievement.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 18:04:08	@youraveragejjoe would the 'invincibles' have been jumping for joy after finishing 30 points off the title?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 18:09:39	@youraveragejjoe different scenario, we're being fucked over by owners,
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 18:23:37	@aarun_spud @JovanDhaliwal its pathetic, 4th is no real achievment. Try a manchester derby, where they are fighting for titles
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 18:24:23	@RichBanbrook35 I hate the way 4th is regarded as an achievment though! Wigan won the fa cup, that SHOULD be better @youraveragejjoe
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 18:28:09	@aarun_spud haha, I'm not criticising the rivalry, I just think its sad that you're all jumping for joy at 4th place, pretty pathetic
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 18:33:00	@aarun_spud yeah I get that, just don't like the fact that 4th is an achievment. That should be a dissapointing season for arsenal imo
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 19:07:44	@youraveragejjoe yeah but newcastle are not as bigger club as arsenal. I don't see how you can just accept 4th being fine every season
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-19 19:16:34	@youraveragejjoe spend some money!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-18 11:36:37	@football_league could you please start doing your job, and give coventry fans the information we deserve regarding the #goldenshare
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-18 12:33:36	@FLForum I wish I shared your confidence! If we are moved, expect an AFC Coventry to be formed #skyblues
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-18 12:53:43	@FLForum I agree, I'm hoping that both are bluffing in order to get the best deal.my concern is that if the golden share is where sisu ...
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-18 12:54:13	@FLForum .. Claim it to be, then haskells bid is irrelevant, and the club makes no progress.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 22:13:32	is it just me or is beckham actually hugely overrated as a footballer? #controversial
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-20 21:18:41	@JoshBland13 I know I saw :p that would have solved a lot of problems!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 13:34:22	More people should acknowledge the fantastic job pulis has done at stoke. #sickoftherugbyjokes
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 14:43:05	@evelyniwank @ChrisHobbs96 errm chris, what are you playing at?!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 14:51:46	@ChrisHobbs96 what a lad I think os what you mean
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 17:10:13	@RichBanbrook35 how did you find that?!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 18:17:58	@JoshBland13 I don't remember you saying that? -_-
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 18:33:40	@JoshBland13 pardew won't go.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 20:28:05	@JoshBland13 benitez being backed surprisingly
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 20:28:40	I think we need akinfenwa #topbanter
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 20:28:59	@JoshBland13 that's what I though, buit he's being heavily backed
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 20:35:37	@JoshBland13 hmm interesting outsider that one. Might put a bet on the porto manager moving to everton.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 20:36:26	Friday afternoon will be the greatest feeling. #fuckoffexams
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 20:44:03	@JoshBland13 it will be interesting at stoke, cause the style will have to change.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 20:47:11	@JoshBland13 for me this is a curbishley scenario. Stoke won't appreciate what they had till it starts going horribly wrong
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 20:47:24	@JoshBland13 mark hughes? Are you high?!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 20:52:41	@RichBanbrook35 he plays shit football though, crewe were so bad every time we played them
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 20:58:56	@JoshBland13 @RichBanbrook35 pulis did a phenomenal job. Cup final and europa league knockout is an amazing achievement
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-21 21:03:10	@JoshBland13 porto guy for everton. Benitez for stoke.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-22 18:20:06	I got a TOTS!!!!!!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-27 20:06:11	Things need to change..
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-24 23:40:19	suppose i need to sleep..
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-27 14:19:27	@JoshBland13 it would be brilliant :')
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-27 16:25:32	@JoshBland13 he should have had the pen!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-27 16:27:47	@JoshBland13 ooh did you see that? #naughtywilbraham
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-28 10:26:04	@RichBanbrook35 similar to your last tweet to me- how did you find this?! #getalife
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-05-24 23:58:44	Neymar is so overrated its ridiculous...
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-01 21:14:57	I dream of a day where I can play a fifa session and not come up against felipe santana #sweat
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-01 21:15:07	4 games in a row!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-02 18:45:58	I say this ever game but I really hate itv
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-02 19:27:01	I can't understand hodgson and england, football is a simple game, just keep the ball. #useless
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-02 20:21:36	England are an embarrassment #pathetic
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-02 20:41:02	Fucking yes! Haha, how is this happening? #smashandgrab
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-02 20:56:57	Really disappointed with walcott tonight. Looks wasted on the wing
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-02 21:02:46	@RichBanbrook35 think they are both very dangerous players, lots of pace, but walcott looked scared tonight. Chamberlain changed the game
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-02 21:03:48	@RichBanbrook35 ...and keep hold of the fucking ball.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-02 21:08:36	@RichBanbrook35 @leonard_shayler i disagree. think he is international standard, but definitely suits being a striker more.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-02 21:25:57	@RichBanbrook35 kill me now.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-03 13:18:47	I love mourinho.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-03 15:52:34	facebook is so damn boring
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-09 10:25:26	So damn happy! :D
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-08 16:34:54	England are an embarrassment at all levels
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-11 17:45:59	wow, Israel. Really?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-12 18:59:40	Want to go and see imagine dragons.

406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-12 20:16:37	University choices are so complicated :(

406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-14 17:48:32	@BBCSport how about you tweet real news, about the decline of #CCFC ? Sort your priorites out. @SkySports
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-14 21:54:08	@football_league you need to start providing answers soon because we won't back down. #SISUOUT

406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-17 20:52:55	I think everyone has suddenly become a huge fan of Tahiti #confederationscup
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-18 19:19:34	Funny how the @football_league. 'S motto is 'real fans' yet they seem to be completely ignoring us. #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-18 21:08:14	I think I may be addicted to dexter
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-20 16:14:01	Odds on a Tahiti victory? #underdog
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-19 17:55:52	Friends has to be the most overrated TV show of all time.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-19 18:07:40	@eiwank truth hurts.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-21 18:40:57	Thank fuck I'm not doing accountancy at uni
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-21 19:45:17	@CharlLT it was ok, I much preferred sheffield though! I did really like the look of geography..
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-23 20:28:46	Iniesta is a phenomenal player
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-22 19:54:25	Macaroni cheese is literally the best.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-22 20:02:17	2 consecutive uni open days. #shattered
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-22 20:19:59	Neymar is a dirty little cheat
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-23 19:18:18	Nigeria actually look a pretty decent side #ConfederationsCup
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-26 20:51:21	Neymar is an utter prick
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-26 20:56:29	Brazil are really beginning to irritate me #cheats
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-24 16:24:41	What is Nadal playing at? #Wimbledon
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-27 16:06:20	@IcyApril I do now!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-27 16:56:07	@IcyApril it never happened, Bramley postponed it until tomorrow.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-27 17:22:59	Really not looking forward to next season #skyblues
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-26 18:53:51	Tweet a lot less than I used to.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-26 19:18:53	Wimbledon this year has been so entertaining. #YearOfTheUnderdog
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-27 19:42:04	Can you imagine pirlo, xavi and iniesta in the same midfield? #godlike
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-06-27 07:20:53	@RheannaFayMoore good, pleased to hear it
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-03 21:28:36	fuck you sisu.

406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-04 01:46:10	@Emma_Perry9 yes, just because im not in the country doesnt mean that I suddenly have a life!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-04 01:47:11	@JoshBland13 @RichBanbrook35 good read. Shame its dave bennett!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-03 21:30:38	Players should refuse to play, then we'll see what SISU's plan is.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-03 21:46:17	Saturday afternoons will never have been so dull. Won'e even care anymore. #SISUOUT

406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-08 19:06:38	@football_league take a look at yourselves, you're a disgrace, destroying one of your football clubs #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-08 19:15:27	Players should refuse to play. That would screw up SISU's plans.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-09 19:29:34	@elysia_lind lets do it next week? haha well could be a lot worse then, and did you get the job?

406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-17 10:10:45	@talkSPORT the way SISU are killing CCFC #FootballAnger
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-20 18:34:53	Really enjoyed the protest today, nice to see the fans united and make a stand! #ProudToBeSkyBlue
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-19 11:12:03	@Coventry_City fuck off, you must be joking. #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-20 11:21:33	At the protest! #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-24 10:05:37	Still can't believe there are fans going to sixfields- you are just contributing to the demise of CCFC #StayStrong #KeepCovInCov
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-23 19:41:06	Just about the worst song I have ever heard just came on the radio. http://t.co/AcYfU4bldz
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-23 19:49:50	LOL Karl Henry trending on Twitter. There's something I never thought I'd see.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-23 20:17:28	@JordanWillis94 blame EA.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-24 16:45:24	@Coventry_City you have absolutely no clue how to run a football club
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-24 16:57:43	Moving lahm into CM cause bayern are lacking options in midfield. #seemslegit
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-24 17:03:00	@JoshBland13 haha, unlucky gotze
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-24 17:05:29	I think a background as a coventry fan results in you hating any team that is successful. Can't stand bayern any more
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-26 14:32:02	@Coventry_City how dare you use #WeAreCoventry when you insist on removing our club from its rightful home. Absolute disgrace #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-24 23:36:26	Having time to think can be very dangerous...
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-29 13:17:26	Christian Benitez has died?! RIP :(
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-29 14:03:30	Casually chilling http://t.co/I1TR5XZYxf
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-30 22:32:31	Sad songs have so much more meaning.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-31 12:17:56	Sir Bobby Robson RIP #Legend
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-07-30 14:25:13	You know what SISU, I dont even care any more, so tired of the bullshit.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-02 21:27:40	@elysia_lind Cheers, thought you would agree
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-03 13:42:12	Hate sounded cocky, but will never get used to us being in the same league as Crawley #sleepinggiant
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-03 14:31:32	The first 20 mins will almost certainly sum up our season. #CCFC
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-03 14:37:40	Everyone ready for the #League2Tour ?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-03 15:03:06	Get @WilliamEdj23 back please Pressley!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-01 15:24:24	How humiliating would it be to be a doncaster fan right now?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-01 16:32:15	So pleased to be portsmouth getting back on track, seems a long way away for us at the moment #CCFC
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-03 17:53:26	@charllt no I didn't go unfortuantely, not condoning the actions but can certainly understand the frustration. Yes its a complete mess :/
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-02 10:29:12	When SISU took over they saved us from administration and relegation to League 1. How I would take that now. #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-02 12:19:21	For me, the only solution is we sit tight, support the boys away from home, until SISU finally give up and fuck off. #citytillidie
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-02 12:21:34	@_CharlieHarris wow, how unfortunate. Happy Birthday anyway, try to enjoy it.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-03 14:26:43	That's right Fisher, we will all come flocking to Northampton with performances like this. Twat.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-03 14:16:20	The worst thing is, I'm struggling to even care. #skyblues
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-03 14:25:54	Oh well, we can blame SISU. #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-03 14:59:07	We can't give up. Its our club and we will get it back. #sisustoleourclub #citytillidie
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-04 10:56:33	@CovTweetLeague Orient 3-1 Coventry please
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-05 16:40:05	@JoshBland13 I'd seen that, so good!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-05 18:43:23	May as well carry on.. #FAYOULETUSDOWNWEWANTCOVCITYBACK #sisuout #keepccfcincov
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-06 19:25:01	For every goal we concede this season should be met with a chorus of #sisuout tweets. #itsallyourfault
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-06 20:36:59	I hate supporting this football club
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-07 07:01:04	@CovTweetLeague 1-1 on saturday please
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-07 22:16:07	@jackm_jarvis enjoy it mate
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-10 10:24:49	Why does my FUT account keep getting hacked? Lost everything again :(
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-11 16:53:04	Regardless of what some say, we proved today that CCFC in Northampton is not a viable option, out home is the Ricoh. #KeepCovInCov #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-11 15:38:38	@Coventry_City is that sarcasm? You shant defeat us. #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-11 15:48:54	Jesus christ cov, you never did this at the ricoh!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-11 16:01:39	Doesn't matter how many wins or how exciting the games are, I will NOT be going to sixfields #NOPM #SISUOUT #KeepCovInCov
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-11 16:40:30	Did anyone catch how many were at the ricoh today?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-13 19:42:07	@CovTweetLeague 4-2 coventry please
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-14 19:25:37	Rooney looks like a pub player at the moment
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-14 20:11:11	Gerrard's set pieces are top class
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-17 16:42:42	Fuck you Linell, stop trying to defend them tearing the club apart. #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-17 22:15:40	Barkley and wilshere in an england midfield &lt;3
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-17 22:32:08	@Sumeet_D_8 we might actually stand a chance if we could produce some half decent centre backs
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-17 23:03:25	@Sumeet_D_8 @JovanDhaliwal he really isn't the answer Jovan :P caulker maybe, we're still very light in that position.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-17 23:03:59	Can i be bothered to stay up and watch our goals? #effort
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-17 23:14:53	@_CharlieHarris hmm ok, I'm trusting you here... Did you go?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-14 18:05:16	Absolute disgrace that welbeck and cleverly keep getting picked for our national team #jokecountry
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-14 18:58:02	Disgraceful to boo over someones else national anthem. Show some respect
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-18 14:25:52	NO LUIZ :( double clean sheet for spurs though :) #fantasyfootball
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-19 15:46:00	Shut up arsenal fans, you have no idea what a crisis looks like.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-17 15:44:00	Please fellow cov fans, don't let these goals persuade you to go to sixfields. #staystrong #NOPM
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-20 22:26:28	@RichBanbrook35 GIVE US BACK THE RICHARD WE KNOW AND LOVE.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-21 21:55:22	@RichBanbrook35 @JoshBland13 I'm thinking Homeland/ Prison Break. It has to be Mandela, it legit could happen.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-20 22:49:04	@JoshBland13 @RichBanbrook35 you're right. Desperate times call for desperate measures
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-20 18:16:27	@orangelauraaa this makes me happy :')
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-21 09:53:41	Spurs look a good bet to challenge for the title even without Bale with these signings #darkhorse
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-21 21:59:21	@RichBanbrook35 yeah thatd be great, that first or game of thrones? Haha :')
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-22 20:56:58	@elysia_lind you've always claimed to be amazing with them?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-21 21:33:15	I'm not sure how I'm going to spend my life once I have finished Dexter...
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-21 21:35:52	@JoshBland13 the answer to all my problems! It better be good.....

406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-22 20:05:50	Want my whatsapp back :(
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-22 21:11:53	@elysia_lind I'm sorry that's pathetic elysia, I expected better
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-24 20:08:32	So even I got addicted to candy crush....
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-24 20:27:45	@JoshBland13 stuck on level 23 -_-
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-26 19:47:26	This is such a boring game
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-27 23:05:22	@eiwank damn, that would have been too funny
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-28 09:13:28	@orangelauraaa bitch.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-30 22:49:11	Way too confused about what the future holds haha
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-09-01 13:49:21	Typical United. As soon as they start losing they start acting like children
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-08-29 21:34:58	University research is so depressing :(
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-09-01 16:54:17	'in arsene we trust' wow could you be any more fickle?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-09-01 17:14:39	Pinch punch first day of the month, no returns. #winner

406335246	TomPercival2	2013-09-02 09:10:08	@_Matt_Parker ...unless you lose at home to Aston villa
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-09-02 09:13:49	@youraveragejjoe @_Matt_Parker shut up -_- #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-09-02 10:22:10	Deadline day is massively overhyped #controversial
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-09-02 10:25:22	@orangelauraaa I think I can. Drop the damn subject
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-09-02 10:28:30	@orangelauraaa neither do I know nor care
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-09-02 10:33:28	@orangelauraaa LAURA I HAVE TO DO A HISTORY ESSAY, THIS IS MUCH MUCH WORSE
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-09-02 10:42:37	@orangelauraaa history &gt; English
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-09-02 11:12:44	Why have Arsenal signed Ozil? They dont need midfielders! #TransferDeadlineDay
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-09-02 12:20:48	@wilbur999 it makes no sense to me. I'd go for centre backs, a goal keeper and a striker

406335246	TomPercival2	2013-11-17 18:03:20	Thank God we've got Steven pressley rather than that twat in charge
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-11-17 20:24:42	Huge credit to pressley in that post match interview, think he handles the situation impressively.
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-11-16 15:55:41	COME ON HYDE!

406335246	TomPercival2	2013-11-19 19:59:49	Article in the Times today about the #skyblues looks like pressley is getting the attention he deserves, but not what we want!
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-11-19 20:18:31	If cleverley can play in England's midfield, why can't I?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-11-19 21:26:31	@JovanDhaliwal haha still doesn't stop Ibra being a God

406335246	TomPercival2	2013-11-26 22:27:05	@HarryPashley haha you should be sympathetic then! Still convinced we'll be back next season. And enjoy your victory
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-11-26 22:28:31	@HarryPashley thought you lot were doing alright?
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-11-26 22:35:27	@HarryPashley Yeah, if we didn't have -10, you'd still be 3 points behind. Play off contenders though
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-11-26 22:38:13	@HarryPashley they've fucked our club over so badly it's frightening. #SISUOUT

406335246	TomPercival2	2013-12-20 08:05:57	I still don't think there's any way they'll build a new stadium. Just need to expose their bluff and leave them with no option but the Ricoh
406335246	TomPercival2	2013-12-25 10:16:41	Hey SISU, fancy giving me the greatest Christmas present I could wish for by fucking off?

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-05 19:11:46	@wozey yeah, probably best he stayed as a scout though
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-05 19:17:23	@wozey maybe, but he was not cut out to be a manager. Another money saving scheme by SISU. I don't think he's been anywhere since
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-05 19:24:38	@wozey yeah I don't blame him for taking the job,you'd be mad not to seek a route into management Shame for him it should never had happened

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-06 19:43:10	@Tom_FA I would he agree, he's been a top class manager, but his signings have been poor, albeit in difficult circumstances

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-10 17:23:59	@0zzym I think it might be, that or there's one space left

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-11 13:42:46	@elysia_lind Haha we might have to make a compilation of classic Elysia comments ;)

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-12 14:38:24	@mikesmith1987 absolutely that's how I feel. For me they other give up on their pathetic game &amp; move back to the Ricoh or the club goes bust
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-12 17:08:18	Pressley new CB please!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-12 17:10:06	@CcfcKai not sure if he's the answer but imo better than Webster
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-12 17:11:58	@CcfcKai Haha really? I'd play seabourne if we sign him and Willis, but would defo go for another option, none have been massively effective
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-12 17:14:34	@CcfcKai Haha not a clue, I thought Daniels could play as a striker? We did the same thing with grandison if I remember rightly
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-12 17:16:32	@CcfcKai Yeah I'd bring in another striker if possible, but priority should surely be CB and a winger
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-12 17:19:24	@CcfcKai I thought he was a striker. Mind you most strikers we sign we turn into wingers anyway haha
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-12 18:25:28	Clarke going to wolves is yet another signal that SISU do not give a flying fuck about our football club if true
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-12 18:25:59	How anyone can justify going to sixfields after everything they've done staggers me
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-12 18:53:17	Personally don't blame Clarke, why would you want to play for #ccfc we're a joke club with our situation

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-11 19:58:06	@amy_harriet nah that was 100% sympathetic
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-12 14:29:50	@mikesmith1987 agree 100%. When this is all over I shall proudly say I never watched ccfc play a home game outside of Coventry
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-12 15:43:14	Yes then city!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-01-14 16:53:00	@FourthOfficial_ have you heard anything about these rumours of Franck Moussa heading to Goodison? #ccfc

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-09 15:56:20	@JoshBland13 I'm seeing a distinct lack of a nomination on Facebook at present
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-08 17:15:35	That was absolutely disgraceful
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-08 17:19:33	@4everaSkyBlue by far the worse I've seen this season, didn't look interested
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-08 17:37:56	@_Matt_Parker have you checked Facebook recently?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-08 17:43:35	@_Matt_Parker haha no worries mate

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-12 22:49:24	@leonard_shayler @Bhuvan_Ark and yet it's still better than supporting Liverpool
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-12 22:58:55	@leonard_shayler @Bhuvan_Ark League 1 mate. And how many games have you been to this season?

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-23 20:09:07	@J_Bland_Writer reckon you could sign this and spread the word? http://t.co/xl980E1EQl #sisuout #kcic
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-23 20:12:27	@J_Bland_Writer thank you, more action needs to be taken, as I'm getting sick of this stalemate now
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-23 20:15:42	@J_Bland_Writer it doesn't look that way, they couldn't care less about the club, all they want is the Ricoh on the cheap.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-23 20:19:35	@J_Bland_Writer the Ricoh. That is all they want. Exactly, and more pressure needs to be exerted otherwise the club will just die.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-23 20:27:03	@J_Bland_Writer it is an asset which they can sell on. They're here to make money, nothing else
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-23 20:30:38	@J_Bland_Writer exactly, the situation at #ccfc is just an extreme example of highlighting the massive problems in football at present
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-23 21:50:24	@orangelauraaa love you x
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-22 17:10:36	Sick and tired of this football club. What can we expect with an awful defence and no strikers? #SISUOUT #InPressleyWeTrust
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-22 17:13:03	And you can stick your new stadium up your arse you absolute bastards, the club will be dead by then
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-22 17:14:40	Oh and Nuneaton managed to double Tuesday's attendance #thepowerofSISU
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-22 17:16:44	I've never been more convinced of a manager than SP, but what is he supposed to do with the lack of backing he gets from those scumbags?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-25 20:57:45	This is just hilarious #MoyesIn

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-02-28 21:49:11	@Coventry_City congratulations, that's a quite unbelievable achievement
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-03-02 15:46:48	Dzeko has to quite comfortably be the most overrated player in the league
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-03-02 15:49:47	@ReeceMohindra all the pundits go on about what a good player he is

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-03-08 18:24:46	Disappointing performance and a long journey home. Sort out the defence!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-03-07 10:57:58	@Coventry_City what time do the coaches depart tomorrow morning? #pusb

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-03-15 11:36:51	Another Sunday game? Great.

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-03-16 15:17:29	Oh, and we're losing. Relegation looking a distinct possibility. How much further can we fall?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-03-16 15:22:11	@jeffconquest that's looking a long way away the way we are playing at the moment...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-03-16 15:32:44	@jeffconquest I'd take as many relegations as it needs to get SISU out. Thin squad, 46 away games, was always going to catch up I guess
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-03-16 16:49:34	Tim Fisher is the single definition of twat
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-03-16 13:28:27	So now it boils down to the question of which team I hate less

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-03-23 12:28:55	Dont wish anyone to be attacked, but i have to admit if someone had to be, Tim Fisher would be pretty high up on that list #SISUOUT

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-03-26 21:39:48	180 mins without scoring against #ccfc - Stevenage you deserve to go down

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-03-25 21:02:03	Credit to dzeko- that is a stunning finish
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-03-25 21:19:34	Man utd's entire gameplan seems to revolve around hopeful crossing. Such little creativity

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-18 14:17:25	@leonard_shayler neuer. Who else?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-18 16:06:04	Who cares if we go down, it's barely our football club any more. Plus a few new away trips will be nice. #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-18 16:14:32	@Gibbo2292 true, I don't know how much longer I can put up with it to be honest
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-18 16:29:40	@Gibbo2292 same, and I never will #fuckoffsisu
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-21 19:16:25	What a goal!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-18 22:41:44	I can only apologise for the number of snapchats I have sent
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-19 15:26:15	"@ENIC_OUT: Our club is having it's heart ripped out and it's breaking mine" you have absolutely no idea...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-19 15:32:57	@wilbur999 @ENIC_OUT exactly, but because we're in league 1, it is all forgotten about
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-22 19:31:21	@ccfcfan subbed on mate
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-22 21:07:05	Listen up kids - don't do an EPQ
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-20 09:59:53	One year on and still nothing has been done @football_league @Coventry_City #TakeUsHome
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-20 13:01:43	Suarez should be banned for that, and to think Liverpool fans continually tell me that he doesn't dive any more
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-22 11:55:22	Praying that these rumours are true, doubt it though #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-21 12:20:43	@OfficialOAFC please delay the kick-off! Serious traffic problems...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-21 14:48:56	That was absolutely shit #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-21 15:56:26	See previous tweet. Mind you, at least it is a clean sheet #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-21 16:42:15	Lots of Liverpool fans seem to stepping out of the shadows #gloryhunters
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-21 16:43:17	@skybluechick he was awful today
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-21 16:59:02	@skybluechick yeah but then again they pretty much all were
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-21 17:02:26	@skybluechick let's hope so, it's killing me not being able to watch my team play :(
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-21 17:04:52	@skybluechick let's hope so, I don't see it happening for a while unfortunately
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-21 19:10:40	This could be anything..
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-23 20:40:41	@danbailey87 bought him :)
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-23 20:42:11	@danbailey87 about 65k I think, on PlayStation
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-23 20:44:35	@danbailey87 Ahh I see. Packed ribery so absolutely loaded
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-27 15:09:10	@Coventry_City this is what I think of your desperate plea #SISUOUT http://t.co/NplhiaNCDA
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-24 19:25:25	The last time we played wolves at home there were 21,000 at the ricoh. This time they'll be around 2,000 city fans. Cheers SISU
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-24 19:30:32	That game though, when Westwood saved a last minute penalty...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 19:14:08	@jackm_jarvis true, he is ridiculously overrated, would take robben over him any day
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 19:17:16	@mikesmith1987 true, I don't understand the hype!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 19:18:06	@jackm_jarvis but he's what 30-31 now? Maybe past his best, and you know what the french team is like - an absolute disaster
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 19:49:03	@jackm_jarvis knew you would mate! I was gutted when I finished it. Might leave it a year and watch it all again
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 19:52:13	@jackm_jarvis the last one which you haven't seen yet, and either the 5th or the one with Miguel I think his name was?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 20:02:54	@jackm_jarvis I won't ruin anything...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 20:03:32	@jackm_jarvis have you got one series left?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 20:04:47	@jackm_jarvis oh right, the penultimate series is quality too
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 20:06:52	@jackm_jarvis haha true, I'm well jealous you're watching it fresh
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 20:08:04	@jackm_jarvis yeah that's the problem haha, I'm doing the same thing with the office atm, loving it
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 20:10:47	@jackm_jarvis surely it runs out at some point? My next after breaking bad is suits
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-01 15:42:20	Picked up one of these badboys #rollingbacktheyears http://t.co/h134uWysn7
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-01 17:21:30	Well snapchat got a little fancy
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-30 10:03:07	Take me home, Highfield road
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 19:11:25	There is absolutely no way ribery is the third best player in the world
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 19:15:49	@jackm_jarvis absolutely and from what I can tell it hasn't been happening for a while
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 19:19:17	I do love watching teams who aren't used to losing in situations like this. Welcome to reality
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 19:25:54	@jackm_jarvis usually I would agree, but they're a mess idk what it is. Only just qualified remember
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 19:27:40	@jackm_jarvis but scraped pass a poor Ukraine side in the play off
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 19:32:00	@jackm_jarvis yeah you look at the individuals and they should stand a great chance but I just don't see it. Brazil or Argentina
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 19:34:01	@jackm_jarvis judging by this Germany don't have a chance! True but combine him with aguero and they'll always be a threat
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 19:36:09	@jackm_jarvis yeah you'd expect Germany to go far. I think garay is a decent player in a league below his level
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 19:39:21	@jackm_jarvis yeah you're probably right, but there the last 4 in my eyes
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 19:54:38	@jackm_jarvis yeah that's the one. Oh yeah forgot about that, I loved them all in honesty
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 20:01:36	@jackm_jarvis yeah haha I loved him, angel was a top guy too
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 20:11:44	@jackm_jarvis yeah I hear that is good as well
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-04-29 20:13:09	@jackm_jarvis yeah I hope so
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-04 23:20:25	Alcohol needs to be left alone for a while I feel
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-04 23:48:55	@OliviaWolden I'm bearing it in mind x
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-05 20:59:54	What a game!!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-05 18:35:49	@RichBanbrook35 actually at the time if writing I was spot on #holdingbackthetears
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-04 22:50:14	Sat with a well fit girl Right now actually love right now @OliviaWolden
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-04 23:44:17	@OliviaWolden I'm feeling under pressure from you to increase the diversity of my tweeting
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-07 21:18:27	@elysia_lind not ok.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-06 16:50:50	Top interview moussa, tell them how it is! #BackToTheRicoh
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-07 09:00:49	I'm loving Spotify’s new look. #FreshSpotify http://t.co/NRX7kziXEN
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-08 15:54:06	@Coventry_City @football_league why are you doing this to us? Is this some kind of joke?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-08 16:03:33	@football_league what you're doing is nothing short of disgraceful. How dare you mock us by awarding your stupid award when 90% don't go
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-08 16:04:05	@football_league take a long hard look at yourselves and do something right for a change. Grow some balls and challenge SISU
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-08 16:05:48	@football_league i would be one of your 'real fans' if you actually gave me a team to support.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-08 18:49:17	@AndyTurnerccfc brilliant piece, couldn't have put it better myself
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 13:50:50	Surely nothing will come close to 2012 #agueroooooo
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 15:05:16	If Norwich get a quick goal or 10 then it's game on
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 15:24:53	Zabaleta is so, so good
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 15:54:12	GOAL: Fulham 2 - 2 Crystal Palace. David has equalised in the last minute. Has that just buggered up your accumulator? #FFC @ChrisHobbs96
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 16:11:13	Liverpool stop playing the money card. The amount spent in recent years is still ridiculously high #excuses
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 16:12:44	@leonard_shayler the difference isn't as much as you'd like to believe
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 16:15:01	@leonard_shayler but that's due to more selling
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 16:20:15	@leonard_shayler the stats will hide Andy Carroll for example, cause torres was sold
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 16:24:52	@leonard_shayler please tell me you are joking...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-12 14:29:44	Part 1 successfully predicted 24 hours later. I should start betting on this stuff http://t.co/EFAdqtEebz
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-12 14:31:04	Alright here we go - malky mackay will be the new #WBA manager.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-12 14:53:33	@RichBanbrook35 Ahh they have history. But to mess with faultless predictions is foolish
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-12 15:46:52	@RichBanbrook35 I'm not sure but you must be able to
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-10 17:21:17	@HarryPashley nope there's two of us don't worry
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 17:46:02	@TomRush17 I would agree, I'm just saying that Liverpool have still spent a lot of money over the last 5 years
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 19:13:58	Real Madrid have done well considering they've only scored 10 goals http://t.co/eRJJJq5aGx
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 20:07:35	Can't see either allardyce or pepe Mel being in charge of their clubs come the start of the new season
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 20:13:32	@RichBanbrook35 I think all of them yeah. Plus sherwood, don't understand the reluctance to use British managers
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 20:17:35	@RichBanbrook35 moyes will get one as well. I'm not sure it is if they're given the chance
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 20:19:43	@RichBanbrook35 I disagree think he'll go straight back in. Well look at poyet - there shouldn't be!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-12 17:36:26	@J_Bland_Writer how much pressure is Jeremy peace under at present?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-12 17:51:54	@J_Bland_Writer yes understandable, just be careful what you wish for. Fairly sustainable club, don't want to end up with a SISU equivalent
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-12 17:53:52	@J_Bland_Writer as said earlier I think you could do a lot worse than mackay. Perhaps rosler, just not pressley please!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-12 17:55:09	@J_Bland_Writer he won't, would be regarded as too risky. Not convinced.by the other two in all honesty
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-12 17:57:10	@J_Bland_Writer I would agree, can never understand the decision to appoint foreign managers, seems like an unnecessary risk
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 21:30:38	@RheannaFayMoore PLEASE STOP OMG
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 21:31:12	@RichBanbrook35 @J_Bland_Writer Ross barkley starts for me
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 21:34:03	@J_Bland_Writer @RichBanbrook35 still a big chamberlain fan despite a lack of games
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 21:36:35	@RheannaFayMoore I know what you're doing and no one else is aware of it, but you should know it's not big nor clever
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 21:38:06	@RheannaFayMoore I would beg to differ, I get the distinct impression you're mocking me
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 21:39:35	@J_Bland_Writer @RichBanbrook35 that would work, but our advantage previously has always been pace on the counter.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-11 21:46:23	@RichBanbrook35 @youraveragejjoe @J_Bland_Writer  worth the risk as our 'reliable' players are not good enough anyway
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-16 19:48:42	Oh what I would do to have been able to witness this day 27 years ago #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-15 13:40:37	Absolute class day.thanks everyone for everything #ClassOf07
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-17 16:12:12	@J_Bland_Writer he changed my mind since we played Birmingham in CCup last year. Now looks a class act
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-17 19:34:31	If everyone just ignored piers Morgan, he'd stop being such a prick
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-17 16:15:25	@J_Bland_Writer he'd help you lot out nowadays, didn't rate him back then though. I did indeed, thanks bud x
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-17 18:15:17	So arsenal have failed to beat both wigan and hull in 90 Mins. They may still win it, but it's hardly been convincing #FACupFinal
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-17 18:34:40	Absolutely outstanding effort by hull. Fans should be very proud of everything they have achieved
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-20 17:04:30	so 1 year into the 3 year stadium plan, SISU have managed to produce this. Happy @football_league ? http://t.co/QaUC0qSBvc
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-23 14:27:38	£50m for David Luiz is absolute insanity
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-24 22:23:25	Why didn't they just kick Simeone? He'd be rolling on the floor for hours
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-25 15:54:31	43,000 fans at a Play Off Final? That's embarrassing
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-27 10:24:42	400 season tickets sold so far. I keep telling myself sooner or later I'll wake up and this was all just a bad dream
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-29 16:49:32	What did Nuneaton get up to this season?! http://t.co/R69jMgOesc
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-29 18:30:09	http://t.co/4aUAspkDdi
Turns out SISU cannot even bullshit effectively any more
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-31 12:05:04	@yidingtons and neither do you. Most fans would kill for finishing 6th in the Premier League
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-31 12:13:01	How much longer are the football authorities going to stand by whilst my football club dies? I can't believe is this continues to happen
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-30 10:19:58	I have just found an acoustic version of Gangnam Style which is truly spectacular
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-31 17:17:44	Jos butter take a bow
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-05-30 18:06:11	STOP PLAYING WELBECK FFS

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-02 16:46:02	Don't like Liverpool, but happy for Rickie Lambert, anything is possible with hard work
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-02 10:50:07	So Leon's dream move to Wolves has failed and he's off to Crawley. Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy... #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-04 20:25:34	@youraveragejjoe he gets a lot of shit for some reason!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-04 20:56:29	@RichBanbrook35 not enough up front, too reliant on pirlo. I've got £10 on Argentina
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-04 21:12:06	@RichBanbrook35 true immobile, forgot about him but unproven at the highest level, serie A is not the strongest.

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-04 21:22:20	@RichBanbrook35 I certainly think they'll get through the group but an ageing side that's got 2 years on a better euro 2012 team
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-06 12:39:52	@J_Bland_Writer @birminghammail there's more atmosphere at the hawthorns than selhurst park?!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-07 20:09:02	If Roy plays welbeck ahead of barkley then we may as well give up
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-07 21:11:04	It don't miss a moments opportunity to stick some adverts on do they? #wewantBBC
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-07 21:34:50	@J_Bland_Writer we're too funny
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-07 21:42:10	@J_Bland_Writer Adrian chiles attempt at showing awareness of the lack of roof was absolute genius
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-07 22:21:00	Sometimes I think Adrian chiles being ITV's football anchor is just one huge practical joke
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-07 23:13:10	It's rare to see a World Cup team with so little ambition like this Honduras side
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-07 23:17:29	Townsend makes criticisms of players like he was Pele's level in his playing days #twat
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-08 11:47:49	I'm ashamed to say I actually agree with @piersmorgan other than I'd probably play Barkley over Berkley
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-10 08:49:38	Praying the judicial review results in a positive outcome, some good news would be nice for once #pusb #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-10 09:19:35	@RichBanbrook35 I'm not sure only time will tell, but it sure as hell can't stay the way it is
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-11 20:43:02	Cannot wait for the moment when I walk out of that exam room for the final time
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-12 15:14:48	Chelsea will be pretty difficult to stop next season
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-12 18:20:37	These opening ceremonies are so pointless #Brasil2014
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-12 19:18:25	Ooh lee Dixon has a brazilian 'friend' #LADalert
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-12 19:48:18	This Croatian isn't bad at all. Tough game for Brazil #WorldCup2014
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-12 19:51:48	@J_Bland_Writer @RichBanbrook35 I find their footballing abilities to be remarkably similar too
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-12 19:58:29	LET'S GOOOO
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-12 21:37:49	I'm sorry but neymar really isn't anything special. Miles behind Messi, Ronaldo, Suarez etc #WorldCup2014
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-12 21:52:30	There are far better teams at this world cup than Brazil. They've got lucky tonight
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-13 20:08:51	Has Van Der Vaart retired from international football?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-13 20:13:56	@ChrisHobbs96 @jackm_jarvis Ahh was gonna say, there can't be much difference between him and de guzman
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-13 20:17:32	@jackm_jarvis @J_Bland_Writer @ChrisHobbs96 you'd prefer VDV for the experience, just. Yeah strootman is class
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-13 20:35:19	Remembering the Van Persie chant at the Emirates last season :') #PUSB
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-13 20:37:48	What. A. Goal
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-13 20:43:05	Pique hasn't been this exposed since he came up against a certain Michael Mifsud #PUSB #WorldCup2014
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-13 11:55:23	3 days before my exam and the OCR website doesn't work...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-14 21:55:05	Mum: "that pirlo doesn't look very British". Her football knowledge never fails to astound me
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-14 22:37:41	GET THE FUCK IN
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-14 22:41:20	Can we have the goal line technology to confirm that please? #fifaareajoke
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-14 23:56:15	Pirlo just oozes class
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-15 00:07:11	@RichBanbrook35 Italy were really not that great. I'd be shocked if they won it
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-16 20:15:02	Please Nigeria I am begging you #acca
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-18 16:22:46	That's an absolutely stunning goal
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-15 16:28:04	Lionel Messi can't get in the ecuadorian side either...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-18 21:45:12	It's a shame to see a player as good as Casillas ending his career in this fashion #legend
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-17 17:10:54	Thanks for everything Joe Murphy, been a fantastic servant for us, don't blame you for moving away from the circus of @Coventry_City
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-19 09:43:13	IT'S FINALLY OVER
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-19 17:25:24	@4everaSkyBlue what time?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-21 12:09:54	Why us that my both my club and national team have to both be so unsuccessful?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-26 15:50:35	Credit to Jerome boateng , that's a hell of a lot of caps at that age... http://t.co/qeVmAqI4XD
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-24 17:44:04	Fuck off Suarez you absolute scumbag
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-06-27 13:06:33	Sandals have actually been bought for Borneo. SHIT JUST GOT REAL.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-07-01 18:58:39	Been away but sounds like the situation at #ccfc is going from bad to worse #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-07-01 19:02:43	New kit actually looks really nice, shame I refuse to give another penny to the scumbag owners of #FUCKOFFSISU
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-07-04 16:07:42	MarioKart is the bomb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-07-05 08:07:40	@Coventry_City give it up, take a look at the responses to all of your tweets and consider what you're doing to the fans #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-07-06 19:38:33	Still struggling to get to grips with the fact that we can't compete with clubs like Bournemouth #pusb

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-07-30 13:05:43	Come on city have a bit of fucking respect #BakerIn #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-07-30 16:40:02	@Coventry_City 500 season tickets sold at early bird prices? It's just getting embarrassing #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-07-30 20:35:13	good win city #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-07-31 19:23:19	This whole CCFC Ricoh situation continues to get more and more ridiculous. Sort it out ffs, how can WBA U21's be playing there?!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-01 15:25:45	Never EVERY fly with Ryan Air
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-04 20:08:37	@CovTweetLeague 2-1 to the #skyblues please!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-04 20:35:13	100 years since the Great War began. Thank you to all those who gave their lives for the ones we live today. #GoneButNeverForgotten
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-06 12:33:39	Got a sneaky feeling tudgay could light up league 1 #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-06 14:32:25	Having a protest at sixfields seems utterly pointless to me, the best way of showing your disgust is refusing to attend - simple. #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-06 14:37:04	If Cardiff fans didn't go the game either that would be great
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-07 07:32:21	Struggling to see how assombalonga is worth twice as much as Wilson, yet another example of SISU's hopelessness in all departments #SkyBlues
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-07 15:41:17	If all football fans could get #BringCityHome trending that would be great #skyblues
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-10 10:52:15	Why does everyone hate on mark Robins? He knew what was coming (sixfields) and got out like any sane person would
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-10 10:53:04	@CovTweetLeague 3-0 to Cardiff unfortunately please #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-10 14:10:05	@jeffconquest i think he knew about the 10 point deduction as well to be honest
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-10 16:32:37	Why are arsenal fans mocking Nasri cause they won the community shield? It means absolutely nothing
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-08 10:32:12	@Coventry_City @football_league what happens theoretically if the money is not paid?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-10 19:55:04	About to begin my first article for @TheBaggiesWay . Hope people enjoy despite me not being a West Brom fan, excited to be part of it!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-08 13:20:25	@the92dotnet the ricoh arena! #BringCityHome
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-08 13:45:22	Hate to be a pessimist, but I'm still yet to be convinced we're as close as people think we are #skyblues http://t.co/2t7KJ20ScH
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-08 13:46:06	I just don't trust SISU in any way and think they still could be playing games. However it looks more likely than it ever has before
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-08 14:15:06	@RichBanbrook35 it was either this one or the rape face, I can't decide which one I prefer... http://t.co/bGvbPX83yG
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-08 14:26:02	@RichBanbrook35 absolutely not and how could you expect to?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 13:43:23	My @Super6: DER 3-1 RTM, MID 1-1 BIR, MIL 1-1 LEE, NOT 4-0 BLP, WAT 2-1 BOL, WGN 2-1 REA http://t.co/BWrkz4Q53b #Super6
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-08 14:48:38	@RichBanbrook35 is there picture evidence?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-08 16:07:36	Urgently need a centre back or two with Seabourne gone, especially if we play a 352 #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 13:44:20	Surprised burge isn't the starting goalkeeper, and fleck missing out seems surprising, but in pressley we trust #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 13:48:09	@_CharlieHarris just thought they'd look to the future with burge whereas allsop is only a short term solution. Did he play u21's in the..
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 13:48:20	@_CharlieHarris week? Difficult to keep track when in Spain
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 13:49:00	@RichBanbrook35 we certainly need at least 1 cb and St in before the deadline if we play that way, but I like it's potential flexibility
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 13:50:19	Best of luck to @LutonTown today #BackWhereTheyBelong
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 13:52:44	@RichBanbrook35 I doubt we'll sign any more midfielders unless they can offload Baker. But a cb is urgently needed
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 13:53:52	Blackpool are absolutely screwed...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 13:55:36	@_CharlieHarris not enthralled by the Miller signing anyway, doubt he can score anyway near enough goals required, heavily reliant on tudgay
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 13:56:24	@RichBanbrook35 God I forgot about him! Still think prutton wouldn't be a bad bet, although SP has ruled that out
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 13:59:26	Come on you sky blues! #PUSB
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 14:02:11	@_CharlieHarris still think we need another striker, maybe a target man
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 14:04:01	God I love football...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 14:06:40	@RichBanbrook35 yeah he'd have been good, as would have been diagouraga
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 14:35:30	Ffs city - and that won't be the last time I tweet that this season #skyblues
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 14:45:02	I was gonna put a bet on Reda! FUCK #PUSB

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 15:50:54	JUST FUCK OFF JAMES HANSON
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-09 16:22:05	The usual overreaction from #ccfc fans after 1 defeat on twitter #keepthefaith

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-12 18:15:20	@Coventry_City vs @CardiffCityFC - the perfect illustration of everything wrong with modern football #sisuout #tanout
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-12 19:30:25	Cardiff City stadium looks like an absolute mess now, fans can't be happy with that http://t.co/Kt5DEkyznc
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-12 19:31:17	@Coventry_City give it up, and while you're at it give up that pointless appeal as well
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-12 20:04:16	Such class from AFC Wimbledon, really appreciated. #BringCityHome
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-12 20:59:54	Doesn't matter how long it's been, it still sickens me that I can't watch my team play at 'home' tomorrow #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-14 09:51:49	Absolutely buzzing

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-15 16:04:40	Glad I didn't fall for the SISU bullshit. The worst owners football has ever seen
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-15 17:03:02	Quite how anyone can still continue to justify going to sixfields after this amazes me.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-13 19:05:32	Our club is a fucking mess. Know who to blame #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-13 19:38:15	@FA @football_league @Coventry_City fuck you all. I want my football club back
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-13 19:58:44	I would rather drown in a pool of my own piss than enter shitfields
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-15 20:29:00	@4everaSkyBlue don't believe a word they say, can never be forgiven for what they are doing

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-16 15:43:35	@Coventry_City and how many people are still entering that shithole?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-16 15:55:24	@Coventry_City this means nothing while we continue to be missed around by you scumbags #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-19 16:54:15	@Coventry_City will there be tickets available on the gate for the MK Dons game? #pusb

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-21 09:43:47	Truly proud to say that I never set foot in sixfields #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-24 16:31:54	@TheBaggiesWay will this be the confirmation of the varela rumours?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-24 19:02:38	This cat is putting on quite a show at the Nou Camp
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-25 16:18:15	If the demand is there, will the North Stand be opened? Very confused
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-25 16:52:02	@Tomkins72 @LiamDes @_CharlieHarris oh good, i thought they were massively shooting themselves in the foot for the Gillingham game

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-26 18:10:29	Can United fans give up on the argument that City and Chelsea have bought the league yet?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-26 19:02:15	Can't decide who I hate more - man United or Franchise FC
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-26 20:07:20	@ReeceMohindra yeah such a shame, look at Southampton
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-26 20:14:56	Ice Bucket Challenges are boring me now. If you're going to donate just do it.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-26 20:43:03	MK Dons fans are just the worst. 3-0 up against United, can hardly hear them #franchisefc
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-26 20:45:49	We kept a clean sheet on Saturday, just saying #BetterThanUnited
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-26 20:48:41	@rishterrr watching the game pal? ;)
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-26 21:04:53	And Leicester humiliated as well. If your own team is crap at least we can take pleasure out of others losing
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-26 21:20:26	Van Gaal should have taken the Spurs job haha
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-28 20:12:02	@CovTweetLeague 1-1 please! #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-29 12:07:09	Next week's game is going to be pretty special #PUSB
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-29 11:16:18	So Wycombe tickets may have to wait until another day #RicohReturn
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-30 21:35:38	@4everaSkyBlue not yet, think he's getting them tomorrow
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-30 21:38:21	@4everaSkyBlue our ex season tickets seats are reserved so a few of us are OK, but it's insane!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-01 10:08:20	@Coventry_City can you still purchase coach travel for the Wycombe game today, even if you can't get match tickets? #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-01 11:04:36	Tim Fisher stepping back to take up an imaginary role of concentrating on a new stadium. Genius
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-01 13:21:13	@Coventry_City can I still buy coach tickets for the Wycombe game?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-31 12:25:31	@CovTweetLeague a 2-0 sky blues win against Wycombe please! #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-30 16:03:16	Good result boys, easier fixtures now to really get some points on the board #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-30 16:04:03	And gives us some positivity ahead of that special night next Friday #pusb #ricohreturn
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-30 19:21:25	@Coventry_City is coach travel still available for the Wycombe game? #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-08-31 22:26:27	Well there's something I never thought I would see... http://t.co/uTl654L4xx
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-01 20:24:11	Thanks Carl Baker for everything and best of luck in the future! gave everything for this football club #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-01 21:49:26	@HarryPashley holds the record of Coventry's youngest ever player
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-01 21:51:04	@HarryPashley no idea, we released him before he was first team. Got a few goals last year i think, for Oldham
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-01 21:38:44	The amount of money spent in the Premier League is ridiculous. #RuiningFootball
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-01 21:51:56	Villa scumbags
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-01 22:17:43	We've actually signed someone on deadline day!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-02 10:11:52	Wycombe tonight, that will be my 31st ground #GettingThere #awaydays
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-02 10:29:36	@mikesmith1987 yeah looking forward to it! All being well we should win as well
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-03 11:30:07	Pressley is staying for now, great news #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-02 21:13:13	Not a good performance but a win nonetheless. Onto magical Friday #pusb #QueSeraSera
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-02 21:13:49	Nice little ground as well! #awaydays http://t.co/Tr6TbttjTW
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-04 17:44:52	@CovTweetLeague 3-1 to the Sky Blues on their #RicohReturn please!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-04 18:33:45	@CovTweetLeague @jawswilson 25k with big Reda as the FGS! #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-03 19:29:09	2 DAYS TO GO
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-03 21:23:53	Never been more excited for a football match in my life than Friday #special #ricohreturn
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-04 23:14:44	TODAY IS THE DAY #RicohReturn #CityComingHome
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-05 15:21:15	Not one to wish my life away, but I'd be happy to skip past the next 3 hours #RicohReturn
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-05 15:35:44	Twitter is just all CCFC - exactly what we want to see #RicohReturn
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-05 17:05:53	@BroadcastMoose 2-0 to the sky blues! #moosecovbackhome
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-09 20:25:45	A pitch invasion because you're beating Andorra by 1 goal. Embarrassing.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 21:39:16	Fans immediately blame a manager when the going gets tough, why is the blame never with players? #nufc
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 22:42:51	Roy Keane's beard is frightening
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-12 21:30:03	@CovTweetLeague O'brien and 16k please!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-12 22:09:14	Hey baby just came on. What an absolute tune
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-15 14:41:01	@CovTweetLeague 2-0 to the #SkyBlues
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-15 14:41:19	@CovTweetLeague Jackson FGS
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 10:00:10	My @Super6: CHE 2-0 SWA, PAL 2-1 BUR, SOU 1-1 NEW, STO 2-1 LEI, SUN 1-2 TOT, WBA 1-1 EVT http://t.co/BWrkz4xVP3 #Super6
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 16:15:43	Another good win, putting a decent run together #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 16:16:09	Pathetic that 15,000 didn't turn up today from last week
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 17:03:18	Pardew has to go soon surely, can't survive without fans support
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 18:22:05	@the92dotnet absolute joke, straight back to the same loyal 11,000 #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 18:47:25	@the92dotnet me too, just goes to show how many there last week were there for the occasion rather than the team.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 18:47:52	@the92dotnet still can't complain, another 3 points and we are home! #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 18:49:46	@the92dotnet good, certainly for those of us who go, there's a feel good factor back, just need that promotion now. Difficult today though
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 18:59:48	@the92dotnet I'd say on balance we just edged it but could easily have been a draw.  Yes we did the same thing to Gillingham last week
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 19:06:13	As if Bournemouth vs Rotherham is now a Championship game
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 19:08:48	@the92dotnet he'll be signing of the season no doubt. Yes, slowly getting used to it i think. How do you think you'll do this season?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 19:15:39	@the92dotnet I've always followed Yeovil and i cant see the heroics of a couple of seasons ago being repeated but i'd imagine mid-table
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 19:16:07	@the92dotnet its out best chance in a while. Far more solid defensively, and Nouble with Jackson could be frightening in L1 -we hope
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 19:19:27	@ashccfc10 @the92dotnet O'brien looks class too. Get Jackson firing and we've got a real chance
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-13 19:30:12	@the92dotnet @ashccfc10 if leitch - smith's shot had gone in, we'd have had 2!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-14 15:09:45	@GaryLineker perhaps you should check Coventry's results recently. #PressleyMastermind
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-14 15:53:06	Jeez its only QPR, get over yourselves
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-14 16:02:08	Don't want to hang around for another week, bring on university now!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-16 20:55:59	It's 1 game, will hopefully be insignificant come the end of the season. Another winnable game on Saturday #pusb #promotionpush
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-18 12:22:18	Mr Tan, Pressley is not available
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-18 15:48:09	I swear our club is cursed. No-one in Coventry wants another load of egg-chasers and especially not at the Ricoh
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-19 19:32:59	@CovTweetLeague 2-1 win, Nouble FGS #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-19 20:17:13	Last night in Coventry. Going to miss this shithole #homesweethome
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-20 08:21:20	My @Super6: AST 1-2 ARS, BUR 1-0 SUN, NEW 0-2 HUL, SWA 1-1 SOU, LEE 2-1 HUD, MIL 2-2 NOT http://t.co/BWrkz4xVP3 #Super6
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-20 08:29:58	@4everaSkyBlue just wait and see!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-20 23:29:07	@emmerryweather what part of fuck you didn't you understand the first time?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-22 20:11:00	IT WAS JUST BANTER.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-24 00:43:39	@FootieJokes United?! No thanks.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-24 20:49:32	@emmerryweather shit, are they bad?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-24 20:51:21	@emmerryweather haha, are you at Leeds now?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-24 20:52:32	@emmerryweather too late to come back?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-24 20:57:43	@emmerryweather everyone seems fine I guess. I saw your room today, looks really sad and empty haha
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-24 21:06:10	@emmerryweather I missed the one this morning haha. Another one tomorrow ffs. Not atm, but idk long term wise
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-25 18:49:53	2 of my 8 flatmates have gone already. Was it something I said?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-25 18:58:11	@emmerryweather Dipsey has moved to accommodation somewhere else. Its getting very lonely haha
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-25 19:03:32	@emmerryweather kind of, we're getting there. Yeah we saw her and she said she would haha
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-24 12:14:54	Is there ever a job that Alan curbishley is not linked with?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-27 17:12:22	Surely soldado offers more than adebayor?  #useless
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-27 18:08:36	I'm a big fan of Neil Warnock, think he's a class manager
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-27 19:22:33	Is anyone having problems with Spotify randomly pausing?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-27 22:28:44	Thanks a lot to those who argued that the North stand should be reopened. Really helped with the atmosphere guys
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-24 20:44:31	@emmerryweather so when you coming back?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-29 23:57:12	Wild night of poppadoms and hob nobs
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-30 20:39:17	@rioferdy5 more fans than there are at Old Trafford tonight...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-09-24 20:45:31	@emmerryweather no, we partly purely because of your absence
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-02 21:26:46	@WaspsRugby you're not welcome in Coventry. That is all.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-02 14:12:45	After 3 hours worth of lectures and seminars today, it's only fair I get 3 days off #hero
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-02 14:38:37	Truly proud to make it on to the wall of fame of @RichBanbrook35. One at a time ladies http://t.co/1HTGVKQkpo
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-02 14:50:48	@youraveragejjoe @elysia_lind only around 20,no big deal x
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-02 19:41:06	Can you imagine supporting a successful team with no problems? No me neither #FuckOffWasps
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-02 20:46:41	Struggle to see how Claus Jorgensen can be described as a legend, purely THAT goal #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-04 11:55:36	£24 to watch a third tier game against Crawley? Football is out of control
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-04 13:52:01	HE'S FINALLY DROPPED CLARKE. Philips should have been first choice from the beginning for me #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-04 13:56:25	My @Super6: HUL 1-1 PAL, LEI 2-0 BUR, LIV 2-0 WBA, SUN 0-0 STO, SWA 3-1 NEW, MID 2-2 FUL http://t.co/BWrkz4xVP3 #Super6

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-04 14:21:32	Feels really weird not being able to go to game any more
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-04 14:43:16	God I hate my football club
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-04 16:03:18	Think it is fairly evident what a huge effect @JohnsonReda has on the team #skyblues
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-04 16:11:13	Some guy just said he preferred to watch us play at Northampton on the radio. Prick.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-05 22:13:55	Losing in the Skrill North play-off final is nothing short of heart-breaking #FM
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-05 22:15:35	@DanieIChapman I'm hurting. Absolutely robbed. There's no chance of that reading being done when I'm in this mental state
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-07 14:46:38	@J_Bland_Writer @FootieJokes oh you're making me blush...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-07 20:35:12	Haha fuck you MK franchise
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-07 19:22:18	Yes then city! #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-07 20:04:56	Pretty much only #ccfc could fuck it up from here...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-08 18:53:36	#FootballAsAKid next goal wins when you're 9-1 down...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-08 22:28:52	@DanieIChapman @Super6 lol cov winning away
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-08 22:31:11	@DanieIChapman @Super6 I was saying the identical thing last week
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-08 22:34:41	@DanieIChapman @Super6 yeah if we don't win I give up.... For another week
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-08 22:38:59	@DanieIChapman @Super6 nah, you see unlike us, Peterborough can actually see games out
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-08 22:43:30	@DanieIChapman @Super6 their manager is the son of football's biggest twat?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-08 22:45:47	@DanieIChapman @Super6 true, can't stand the guy, good job we always beat him
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-11 14:19:42	Decent last night @J_Bland_Writer @DanieIChapman http://t.co/VZCIOWczK6
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-11 14:31:55	Unbelievable, absolute shit
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-11 14:53:00	Continue to wonder just how far #ccfc can fall
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-11 15:54:41	Everyone calling for Pressley to go needs to get their heads examined
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-11 16:00:34	@d_astbury97 the circumstances make success impossible, you won't bring anyone in of greater quality
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-11 16:01:09	@mikesmith1987 I don't think so, he's working off a sixfields budget, couldn't have brought quality in
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-11 16:04:43	@d_astbury97 but the club as a whole is a mess and that is reflected on the pitch. It's a club in decline
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-11 16:05:12	@mikesmith1987 agreed, think the formation needs a change
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-12 16:45:32	England games wouldn't be quite so bad if Andy townsend wasn't commentating
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-12 18:00:47	I think I'm right in saying Estonia made the play-offs last EU Quals so it wasn't the easiest game in the world
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-12 18:01:52	It's not as if all the major nations bulldoze through these teams 100% of the time. They don't.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-11 17:48:45	7pm with thunder and lightning, so the ice cream van thinks he'll get a fair few sales
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-11 17:57:04	I think the only amusing thing about today's result is that we fucked over everyone's Super 6
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-11 18:36:59	@dannyswhite some of us are still here
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-13 17:07:12	@DanieIChapman http://t.co/wtvPg93obe
Wild night of banter and rivalry?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-13 17:09:32	@DanieIChapman I'd imagine our dead players are a lot worse than yours. Unless it's Adam Barton's time to shine
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-13 17:15:17	@DanieIChapman Pertrasso playing or is he out on loan again?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-13 17:16:33	@DanieIChapman Oh yeah I remember you saying
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-13 19:38:18	What a goal that was! #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-15 17:53:17	@DanieIChapman how dare you, Nouble is God
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-15 17:59:54	@DanieIChapman I'm happy to grant permission for a Tudgay comparison
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-15 18:03:10	@DanieIChapman I used to be, but he's been absolutely useless for us
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-17 10:53:11	Something dodgy about these 'minor knocks' that have kept Reda and Nouble out for the best part of a month #skyblues
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-17 10:56:08	@_CharlieHarris Nouble may not be the type to get to SP's standard of fitness and pressing etc, reda would be more surprising
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-17 11:30:21	@_CharlieHarris rightly so to be fair, it's all gone to shit since then
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-17 11:36:36	@_CharlieHarris at the same time, it's pretty poor that our team relies so heavily on a centre back. I remember thinking it was a big loss
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 11:46:26	I am voting in @TheFBAs for @niilampteyshow as the Best #Podcast Football Blog - http://t.co/FRFylFba3D
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 12:04:36	@NiiLampteyShow no worries, keep up the good work! #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 12:52:25	Got a feeling we'll win today, and in the process mess up everyone's accumulators.. #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 13:04:50	@jackm_jarvis @J_Bland_Writer I've just got that feeling, plus you'll get good odds. You going today Jack?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 13:07:31	@jackm_jarvis @J_Bland_Writer good lad, miss it so much
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 13:12:12	What a game this is
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 13:13:09	Good to see Coulibaly starting, should give us sometihng different #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 13:17:43	@jackm_jarvis @J_Bland_Writer we tend to perform better against the sides towards the top of the league anyway
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 13:20:55	Aguero is unbelievable
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 13:30:12	@ReeceMohindra I know, he could have had a double hat-trick!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 13:41:41	Is Fleck injured?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 13:43:34	@_CharlieHarris that's a blow, i dont know why we are picking up so many injuries
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 13:49:04	@_CharlieHarris I suppose we may just be getting unlucky, but it seems like far too many
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 14:43:47	5/6 in my acca so far
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 14:52:56	Allsopp not good enough
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 14:53:03	Clarke not good enough
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 14:53:11	Webster not good enough
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 14:53:17	Formation not working
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 14:53:43	Come on SP, things need to change!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 14:54:31	@dannyswhite one of the worsr i've seen, been shocking ever since we signed him
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 14:55:53	@4everaSkyBlue we haven't won since I left!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 14:57:56	Having said this, I'd rather be bottom of the league at the Ricoh than top at Sixfields #CityAreHome
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 15:27:17	Come on @CambridgeUtdFC all I need is a goal
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-18 15:41:48	Surely everyone's Super 6 is dead
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-17 20:43:50	My @Super6: ARS 4-0 HUL, BUR 1-1 WHA, PAL 0-2 CHE, EVT 3-1 AST, NEW 1-1 LEI, SOU 3-1 SUN http://t.co/BWrkz4xVP3 #Super6
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-16 15:14:52	Just realised I haven't actually seen us lose this season...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-16 15:15:09	Go off to university and it all goes to shit #omen
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-16 15:49:32	@jackm_jarvis haha well I'm back for the festive period so we'll probably pick up again then
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-16 15:51:04	@jackm_jarvis oh yeah true,that may blow the record haha
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-16 15:52:56	@jackm_jarvis well Bristol City next will probably be the first...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-16 15:58:04	@jackm_jarvis we tend to do better against the better teams though
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-16 16:03:33	@jackm_jarvis otherwise we'll be out of the play off race before the season has really started
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-19 13:41:56	Johnson scored about 1 good goal with his left foot and now tries that every time. Useless.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-19 13:49:36	The balotelli hate is real
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-19 14:22:07	What a game this has been!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-21 19:44:56	Could anyone tell me what it is like to support a vaguely successful team?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-21 20:27:40	Losing 4-1 to Oldham. Remember these days as we lift our third consecutive Champions League trophy in 10 years time
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-21 20:29:58	The only negative thing about the Ricoh Return is that it has taken the spotlight off our scandalous owners #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-22 20:26:16	Arsenal fans can piss off if they're looking for sympathy. Trust me, you haven't got it bad at all.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-22 20:55:38	Liverpool in a similar situation to #ccfc at the moment. Concede too many, and can't replace last seasons goals
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-23 15:26:16	The fact that I have managed to go 5 weeks without losing my key is definitely worthy of some sort of medal
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-23 18:56:25	@TheBaggiesWay that ever so reliable source ;)
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-23 18:57:30	European football just hasn't been the same in Tony Hibbert's absence. #WelcomeBack
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-23 19:55:49	Lamela is worth £30m just for that. What a goal
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-24 13:34:02	Be very interesting to see how Callum Wilson would get on in the Premier League were he to be given the opportunity #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 13:10:11	@jackm_jarvis yeah true, had a look and both are in bad form, so its a tough one to call. Think Norwich are good away though
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-26 21:57:04	"@G0Spurs: You don't understand pain if you aren't a tottenham fan." unbelievable, not a clue.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 12:25:42	My @Super6: LIV 2-1 HUL, SOU 2-1 STO, SUN 0-2 ARS, WBA 1-1 PAL, NOT 0-0 BLB, WED 1-2 NOR http://t.co/sNIIs7DroM #Super6
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 12:31:01	@jackm_jarvis yeah they are, just think that Palace will get a point today. Be very happy with £500k!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 12:35:02	@jackm_jarvis they did yeah, but I like Palace, think they're good enough to get a result. What do you need to get for that?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 12:39:35	@jackm_jarvis its so difficult, winners must be so rare. Presume no-one predicted the Southampton score last week....
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 13:24:04	Credit to Pressley, he's changed it and finally dropped Allsopp #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 14:31:20	I don't even know why I like football so much. It continually just pisses me off
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 14:31:55	The one team we've had in years which was entertaining we didn't get to watch, now we're back same old story #skyblues
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 14:40:45	Wilson surely on his way to the Premier league next season? #goalscorer
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 14:45:17	@mikesmith1987 to be fair I wasn't convinced he could definitely step up, Bournemouth took a risk
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 14:54:53	@mikesmith1987 he was quite injury prone though when he was younger, just hope it doesn't strike again
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 15:01:20	As far as I'm concerned, everything that goes wrong with CCFC is the fault of SISU. They are responsible for the continual decline, not SP
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 15:22:53	O'brien you hero #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 15:24:39	WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH COVENTRY CITY?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 23:26:26	@ChrisHobbs96 heading down to Exeter in 2 weeks time pal, grab a drink if you're around?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-25 23:40:05	@ChrisHobbs96 yeah will do bud x
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-26 00:42:38	@TomPercival2 I'm sorry football I didn't mean it
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-27 22:58:14	23 managers have left their positions since the start of the season. Football is so messed up
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-28 21:28:36	@DanieIChapman @leytonorientfc Bring on Saturday! #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-28 21:33:20	Callum Wilson I miss you.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-28 21:33:32	And I want the world to know.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-28 21:39:02	Callum Wilson doing #CCFC proud. Truly hope he goes right to the top, has all the attributes to do it
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-29 02:05:16	Love a bit of gymnastics
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-29 16:29:49	@_CharlieHarris Are you referring to this? I dont know cause i havent got the new FM http://t.co/ndkw6xYs4z
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-29 16:31:49	@_CharlieHarris Oh i see haha, yeah it looks absolutely shocking
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-29 22:00:48	If ever you feel down, I'm pretty sure this picture can cheer anyone up http://t.co/idilv5hiUU
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-29 23:40:04	If Madine comes in, presume Tudgay is on his way out? No way we need 6 strikers #SkyBlues
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-30 00:09:23	@jeffconquest guessing that's why he's looking for another big man, because without nouble it doesn't seem to work
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-10-31 18:42:58	Cannot wait for the game tomorrow, first since I moved away #pusb #awaydays
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-02 15:16:50	Don't think I could ever get tired of listening to wonderwall
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-02 18:36:53	The interviews with non-British managers are awful, mostly a waste of time
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-02 21:11:53	The 15 second wait between episodes on Netflix is pretty brutal when you just don't have the energy to get up
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-03 22:16:06	Casually jamming to primary school assembly songs
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-03 21:26:36	Walked past this guy on Saturday #sisuout http://t.co/mvzPS3cRng
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-05 20:58:23	Stuart Pearce once again proving what a terrible manager he is
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-05 21:15:09	Pellegrini just does not convince me as a top class coach
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-05 21:18:58	@RichBanbrook35 it's all too narrow and predictable. You don't need a holding midfield against CSKA at home, yet they start Fernando?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-05 21:21:27	@RichBanbrook35 they wouldn't if they controlled the game like they should. But Toure is too often a liability
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-05 21:23:21	@RichBanbrook35 its far too obvious. Agreed, Mourinho with that squad would walk away with the league
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-05 21:28:00	@RichBanbrook35 easy, it'll be effectively all over by Christmas
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-07 20:30:19	Fair play Worcester, don't mean to be patronising but have a top day out #skyblues
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-10 14:37:25	@_CharlieHarris it's not that, I just don't think it's his fault, and there are hardly any better options imo
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-10 14:40:37	@_CharlieHarris he should go if he loses the dressing room, you can't just keep for him the sake of longevity, but right now I support him
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-10 14:42:03	@_CharlieHarris I was at Orient and he certainly hadn't there. Quite frankly don't care what Clarke has to say as he is shit anyway
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-10 14:44:34	@_CharlieHarris that's the impression I have got admittedly, but it's only a small part of a long season, it's too early to judge
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-10 21:26:11	@SackPressley fuck off. #InPressleyWeTrust
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-09 15:22:57	@Coventry_City go fuck yourselves. Sick and tired of this continual shite week in week out.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-09 15:23:56	And yeah that's right, I blame SISU
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-09 15:44:41	The fact is this club will never get back to where it should be until SISU have gone. That's the fundamental problem #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-09 18:49:17	I don't understand how some people can do it, as much as I'd love to, don't think I'll ever be able to give up on #ccfc #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-10 11:22:13	Great interview with Tim Fisher on CWR. Actually asking the twat the right kind of questions. #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-10 11:22:54	"There's so many things we can be positive about." ARE YOU SERIOUS??
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-10 11:23:48	You have taken a mid-table Championship club and absolutely destroyed us. I'm struggling to see any positive aspect...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-11 14:48:06	@RichBanbrook35 i thinnk it'll just take time. Its not just that, its the mentality of the football club, and that wont change overnight
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-11 12:29:54	https://t.co/oDEco8tWPQ Full credit to Pressley, exactly the attitude we need #SkyBlues
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-11 13:22:01	@RichBanbrook35 you're Pressley out aren't you?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-12 20:33:38	How are we playing? #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-12 20:38:30	@ashccfc10 surely it's not worse than Sunday?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-12 21:21:20	Please hold on city ffs
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-12 21:27:58	GET THE FUCK IN. QUE SERA SERA
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-12 21:28:44	fuck the haters, PRESSLEY YOU'RE MY HERO
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-12 21:31:13	@4everaSkyBlue you'd like to think so, but it is Coventry..
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-12 21:41:13	You don't understand how badly I want to see the sky blues at Wembley, JPT or not
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-12 21:56:43	Gillingham at home would be great #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-12 19:40:36	Come on city, do us proud #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-15 16:42:09	Webster has been fucking useless from the moment he came here. A constant liability.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-14 12:33:48	Time to give up yet SISU?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-21 19:29:22	Anyone know what Ely is like? Considering I'll be stuck there for 2 and a half hours...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-22 11:10:29	So I'm in Coventry the weekend City are closest to Norwich. Who thought this was a good idea?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-22 12:12:45	@ayeshaj95 thanks very much! Xx
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-22 14:18:30	@AndyTurnerccfc Haynes in midfield?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-22 16:55:35	Massive, massive win. Hopefully onwards and upwards #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-23 12:22:12	Met @KSIOlajidebt and was photobombed by @wroetoshaw, standard night out http://t.co/AYyQSCVjI4
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-24 23:38:51	Not sure if villa Park or ricoh arena...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-28 18:37:15	@4everaSkyBlue I think it's the 12th December or something like that
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-28 18:38:38	@4everaSkyBlue nope, maybe in the summer though
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-28 18:43:41	@4everaSkyBlue yeah haha, came back to cov last weekend, trains an absolute joke
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-28 20:01:40	When our manager describes a match against Walsall as a 'derby', it finally sinks in just how far we have fallen #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-29 18:34:26	I seem to now spend the majority of my life watching Andy Tate vines
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-29 18:36:00	@4everaSkyBlue true, but not for much longer #goingdown
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-30 03:05:07	@joeprttn can you let Dan in plsx
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-30 17:36:21	The percentage of my budget which is spent on alcohol is frightening...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-30 20:39:38	@DanieIChapman the only thing that stops Pirlo from being a great is that he didn't play in a tougher league. But the guy is class
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-30 20:43:30	@DanieIChapman potentially, I think Gerrard has been overrated for years anyway, Lampard has always been the better player
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-30 15:56:00	Only when he retires will people appreciate what a player Frank Lampard has been
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-29 11:41:21	I remember the last time we played Walsall  at home we beat them 5-1, a repeat would be lovely #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-29 11:43:17	@jeffconquest if we want to get anywhere close to where we should be aiming for this season, we need 4 or 5 wins on the bounce very soon
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-29 14:42:10	My @Super6: BUR 1-0 AST, LIV 2-1 STO, MNU 3-0 HUL, QPR 0-0 LEI, SWA 3-1 PAL, WHA 2-2 NEW http://t.co/BWrkz5oJdf #Super6
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-29 17:19:13	At least we can laugh at Leicester being bottom of the league
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-11-30 23:55:14	The speed of university Wi-Fi makes me want to shoot myself repeatedly
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-01 13:09:16	So 1 month before the calendar has even begun, one of the players has gone, God knows the situation in 12 months http://t.co/tZ0WKODaiW
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-01 13:09:34	That is presuming that Clarke never plays for us again
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-01 18:32:08	Sometimes I feel like I want Champions League glory with AFC Telford more than I want a degree #FM
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-01 18:58:18	@football_league any chance of getting SISU to fuck off as well? #ccfc
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-02 00:26:18	Why do Frozen songs always have to played?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-02 00:31:54	@paranormalgoat you're having a laugh right?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-02 00:35:03	@paranormalgoat YOU'RE JUST LIKE THE REST OF THEM
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-02 00:37:58	@paranormalgoat I get shit for not knowing the words and it hurts me

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-02 22:02:33	Of all the teams to fuck me over, villa. Really?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-02 22:02:50	I didn't even need a palace win, only wanted a draw
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-02 22:16:25	Please say Franchise FC don't get promoted, worst club in existence
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-03 18:36:05	Michael Clarke has shown such class over the past couple of weeks
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-06 21:36:12	https://t.co/qUzWsIKTDQ
Fans of big clubs are so fucking disrespectful towards proper football clubs. Unbelievable
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-06 21:36:52	Welcome to the real world when you can't win every single week
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-06 21:49:13	@TheSimonGilbert compared to what us Coventry have been through they should be embarrassed.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-06 22:37:43	@jackm_jarvis @J_Bland_Writer remember at Wycombe when i was mocked for over hyping Matic? Have opinions changed? #managerialmastermind
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-07 21:03:48	Coventry not being in the 3rd round of the FA Cup is just so wrong #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-06 23:15:17	@jackm_jarvis @J_Bland_Writer haha very true
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-06 23:17:32	@jackm_jarvis @J_Bland_Writer he's absolute class, such an important player
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-06 23:27:20	@jackm_jarvis @J_Bland_Writer true, reminds me a little of Viera
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-06 23:35:12	@jackm_jarvis @J_Bland_Writer no not yet, but think he has the capability to if he was given the license. Think he is told to sit back
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-06 23:48:47	@jackm_jarvis @J_Bland_Writer yeah maybe you're right, although he scored a decent goal at Everton if I remember correctly
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-07 01:43:23	@J_Bland_Writer @jackm_jarvis and where does the mastery of Jack finch rank amongst these footballing heavyweights?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-06 00:59:12	@4everaSkyBlue what a LAD
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-07 17:54:51	Only when Messi and Ronaldo have retired will we truly appreciate how lucky we were to see both of them play
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-08 17:10:41	Blasting out Heart of Courage as AFC Telford take to the hallowed Wembley turf for the 2023 League 1 Play Off final
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-08 17:12:02	Seriously need to get out more...
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-08 18:36:52	and we lost. Painful.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-10 16:13:19	Nearly made it the whole semester without an appearance on the chunder list and blew it on the last night. Gutted.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-10 19:28:22	We're playing Bristol city not real Madrid. They're not world beaters
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-11 12:23:40	@Coventry_City RT if you think SISU should go
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-10 20:24:36	Webster is without doubt one of the worst defenders I have ever seen play for this club. Get rid. #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-10 20:26:15	@skybluecol he has been ever since he joined. Got a feeling he's pressleys best mate
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-10 21:27:46	And so this confirms another season of mediocrity &amp; decline as our scandalous owners continue to destroy this once proud football club #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-10 21:47:11	I hate supporting City. Cheers Dad.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-10 21:49:14	Why blame the manager? Ultimately until SISU go, this club will never be able to progress
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-10 21:49:41	A new manager would pick up a few early wins, but in the grand scheme of things nothing would change

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-14 14:56:27	This United team is terrible, constantly bailed out by De Gea
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-16 21:44:15	Just spent 15 minutes watching Fail Army videos. My life is so dull.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-16 22:33:20	@LNR_bickers absolutely, we need a borneo reunion!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-16 22:42:35	@LNR_bickers give me a time and a place and I'll almost certainly be there
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-16 22:54:29	@LNR_bickers fine by me, I'm pretty much free whenever
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-15 13:38:41	It took me approximately 3 games of fifa to remind me why I used to hate it so much
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-17 15:40:21	My Football Manager has died, and with it a large proportion of me.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-17 16:17:00	@RichBanbrook35 very impressive stuff! Its yet another load of achievements to add to your already impressive CV
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-19 21:02:03	@4everaSkyBlue dad mentioned it, have no idea what to make of it
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-19 22:19:48	@DanieIChapman can't blame the guy for making money while he can
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-19 22:23:20	@DanieIChapman yeah totally agree

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-19 23:08:20	@J_Bland_Writer @Super6 in what way?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-20 14:59:46	The footballing giants of Fleetwood http://t.co/AG1ojP6ekP
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-20 17:22:03	Better second half, dissapointing overall. 7 games unbeaten for me this season, I can only apologise to #ccfc fans for ever moving away!
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-20 17:23:18	Maddison looks one hell of a talent too! #pusb

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-21 10:08:13	I'm glad I'm not the only city fan who can see the hypocrisy of people supporting the wasps move. I have absolutely no intentions of going
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-21 15:22:24	STOP CHASING EGGS AND RUINING THE PITCH, MORE IMPORTANT SPORTS NEED TO BE PLAYED @WaspsRugby
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-21 18:01:11	Putting Wasps flags alongside Jimmy Hill is a fucking disgrace to whoever did that
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-24 16:15:13	Why is elf the only Christmas film that is not on at the moment? It saddens me

406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 15:10:53	please don't tell me it was Webster's fault again?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 15:26:45	OH FUCK OFF CITY
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 15:27:17	God knows what the attendances will be like if we keep this up
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 15:34:32	@Geordiebaggie I was talking about Coventry, but it's still applies to you lot haha
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 15:35:10	On a brighter note, the accumulator is looking tasty at present
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 15:43:28	@Geordiebaggie do you think Irvine will be sacked?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 15:45:12	so far so good... http://t.co/ITGbYNNhQL
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 16:38:30	Is there any team in the country that is worse to support than Coventry?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 16:40:14	Pathetic, absolute joke a football club we are
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 16:41:02	Why did I have to be born in an era when we are utter dogshit?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 16:41:28	@leonard_shayler you have to be kidding me.
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 16:48:01	Pressley is on a 4 year contract. For those who want him to go you have to remember who are owners are
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 16:50:20	@leonard_shayler we're 18th in league 1. It's tragic
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 16:53:02	Can Webster be sent off as well please? That'll make us a far better side #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 17:09:16	Said it many times before, the ultimate problem is the owners. The best manager in the world can't turn this around until they have gone
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 17:10:07	@leonard_shayler you're right,far more likely to go down I fear
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 17:19:23	No width, no pace, no creativity. Miraculous transfer window needed #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 21:58:48	@_CharlieHarris at the same time he has to be regarded as weak and something that needs addressing?
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-26 22:05:34	@_CharlieHarris agree midfield is the priority, but from what I've seen this season he is an awful goalkeeper
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-28 10:27:24	@skybluecol can't see him going anywhere soon, he's on a 4 year contract and you know what sisu are like #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-28 13:31:56	@skybluecol true, just dont think they care about the football club enough to put their hands in their pockets
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-28 17:38:42	Have to say, I've given him a lot of stick, but Webster was really solid today #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-24 22:08:16	@DanieIChapman @SantaBanter_ mate it was top banter, got to be RT'd
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-24 22:21:14	@DanieIChapman @SantaBanter_ I don't even know what you're saying haha
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-24 22:22:34	@DanieIChapman @SantaBanter_ haha knew it pal, have a top night
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-29 18:49:59	@DanieIChapman come Coventry haha
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-29 20:17:19	@DanieIChapman haha well the offer is there if you want to
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-30 23:28:42	@d_astbury97 mate, could still be relegated yet
406335246	TomPercival2	2014-12-30 22:38:07	I feel like new years is going to be absolutely phenomenal or seriously tragic
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-01 12:21:06	@4everaSkyBlue you too
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-01 13:21:11	Shawcross is twice the defender of both smalling and Jones, but guess which one won't make the next England squad?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-01 13:29:06	@mkcobbler82 exactly right, then we wonder why we continually fail at tournaments
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-01 14:26:40	Anyone know why there are no FL fixtures today?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-01 16:46:57	Well arsenalfantv is going to be very entertaining tonight 😂
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-02 11:59:28	Wish people would stop banging on about the slip constantly, and give Gerrard the credit he deserves
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-02 12:11:08	@TomPercival2 having said that I'm still #TeamLampard
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-02 13:45:34	God I hope the decision to go to Walsall tomorrow wasn't a horrible mistake #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-02 15:44:08	http://t.co/x4jQbyVPMN Just the perfect way to sum up SISU
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-01 21:30:14	I see what you did there football manager http://t.co/pqZ1S5MVeD
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-02 11:13:43	Another article involving SISU talking the same shite. Do everyone a favour and allow us to pick up the pieces of the mess you created
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-02 11:44:51	18 months in, and they're still only talking about a new stadium. Just fuck off #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-02 12:18:43	@J_Bland_Writer PLEASE STOP.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-02 12:22:56	@J_Bland_Writer yeah exactly, especially the fans of teams that the slip had no influence over at all
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-02 20:16:28	@4everaSkyBlue @Sisuoutccfc I am now!
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-03 21:43:36	Top day out and a good win! My unbeaten streak continues. @Coventry_City if you give me free tickets to every game we'll get play offs x
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-03 21:46:50	@DanieIChapman @Coventry_City 8 unbeaten this season pal, we keep that up and we're off to Wembley haha
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-03 21:57:49	@DanieIChapman @Coventry_City haha too true, at least I'm used to it
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-03 22:04:37	@DanieIChapman 13th I think? Its the Tuesday
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-03 22:14:15	@jeffconquest that doesn't surprise me somehow!
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-03 22:14:29	@DanieIChapman sweet, I'll be down for that pal
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-03 22:17:44	@jeffconquest yeah credit to him, seem to put that behind him, and I thought he held it up really well. Not a bad record for a 31 year old!
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-03 23:45:02	Coventry 1st goal s Walsall https://t.co/hp6CEbpT0w
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-07 13:37:50	Great news getting Fleck on a new deal #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-07 14:02:28	God I miss Franck Moussa and his wonder goals
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-07 17:34:40	@Anthony_Hornsby Norwich vs Cardiff. Can't believe it!
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-07 17:53:40	@Anthony_Hornsby £15 is great value for a PL game. But Norwich sell out so why wouldn't you if people are willing to pay
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-07 18:31:27	@Anthony_Hornsby personally I miss the joys of watching callum ball
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-07 17:31:34	As if it's going to cost me £35 to watch a championship game. Football has gone mad.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-07 18:01:21	@Anthony_Hornsby yes exactly, I know Ipswich is very expensive too
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-08 15:45:43	Jordan Clarke leaves and Andy Townsend will no longer be commentating. There is a footballing God.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-10 16:15:41	I hate not playing on a Saturday
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-10 16:40:42	One of the many, many reasons villa should be relegated is their ability to ruin #MOTD every single week
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-10 18:21:38	Shocking news about Malanda, thoughts with his family
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-10 19:13:05	Palace fans really weren't that great in the championship
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-10 19:22:20	@JF_1010 I'm talking average games, of course it would be then. Fair play to you anyway, important to make SP a fortress
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-10 19:22:40	@JF_1010 but when I went it was dead
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-10 19:28:45	The hypocrisy is too much http://t.co/lBMBcq4Z1o
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-10 22:12:21	@DMAC102 if you get too pissed off fancy replacing SISU at Coventry? #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-12 15:18:35	Coventry City vs Swindon &gt; Ballon d'Or
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-12 16:38:11	@JoeRanger118 yeah we've also been poor at the Ricoh, so the points are there for you. Hopefully our big players show up and win the game
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-12 20:34:38	Absolutely fucking dire
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-12 20:35:23	Just utter utter shit
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-12 20:35:48	Webster, Allsop,  Jackson can fuck off
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-12 20:36:35	This once great club is now totally embarrassing @Coventry_City
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-12 20:39:10	How can anyone defend allsop? He's a truly terrible GK
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-12 20:51:58	@mkcobbler82 our club is an absolute mess
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-11 18:10:28	Why does Van Gaal get no stick despite spending more money than anyone in British history in the summer &amp;  no chance of the title?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-12 21:02:16	@mkcobbler82 until these scandalous owners are in charge the only way is down. Can't blame fans after sixfields disgrace
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-12 21:17:22	Andy Webster as captain is the final nail in the coffin
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-12 21:58:51	Someone behind me criticised the SISU protest? Why?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-12 21:59:17	They are entirely responsibly for destroying my football club #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-12 22:00:28	Having said this, Swindon seem by far the best team in this division
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-12 15:28:05	@JoeRanger118 I think it'll be a draw. We have picked up recently, but you lot a good away. Could depend on if Madine &amp;Johnson are fit. You?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-14 20:15:54	Nice to see the club is consistently shit at every level #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-17 23:25:19	CITY TILL I DIE
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-17 23:28:18	No matter how bad it gets I will never give up in my football club #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-17 23:31:15	@Coventry_City look at the fucking trend #sisuout just leave us alone and let us pick up the pieces. WE WANT OUT FOOTBALL CLUB BACK
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-17 23:31:39	@J_Bland_Writer kind of
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-17 23:37:03	@J_Bland_Writer well fuck
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-17 17:57:08	@GaryMadine9 I love my club but it's getting really difficult now, positivity has completely vanished #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-17 18:51:05	Maybe one day we'll wake up and find these last few years with Coventry city were all just a terrible, terrible dream #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-17 23:45:59	@J_Bland_Writer #sisuout #sisuout #sisuout save my club
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-18 00:32:35	@J_Bland_Writer I don't get give aa shit, they fucking destroyed me football club
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-19 14:52:18	@Coventry_City please just stop
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-18 21:50:32	People seemed to have changed their minds on him, personally relived Allsop has gone, never looked good enough to me #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-18 22:42:06	@tpalmer77 he's by no means entirely at fault, be he gave us no confidence and seemed to be really nervous.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-21 22:19:57	Tempted to create a have sisu announced plans for a new stadium yet? twitter account
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-21 22:28:00	@youraveragejjoe haha it would be an account with real longevity
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-21 22:35:33	@youraveragejjoe @r4v5t4r has it actually?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-22 16:15:24	So the policy of no more loan signings has been abandoned I see #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-22 17:52:55	@rockmyster5 we were supposedly due for a clear out after Worcester and acting decisively early on.neither happened, absolute joke
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-23 18:10:29	A different transfer window, same old SISU. Please do us a favour and fuck off
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-23 21:16:34	OMG IT'S CHRIS DUNN
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-23 21:16:52	Had genuinely forgotten he existed
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-23 21:19:14	Callum Wilson &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; James Wilson
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-23 21:33:15	@TheBaggiesWay @J_Bland_Writer you just had to didn't you?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-24 14:14:18	Why are CWR commentating on the Wasp's game? Nobody cares.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-24 14:19:11	@RichBanbrook35 it's all just thoroughly depressing
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-25 14:01:18	How can Bristol City afford that squad?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-29 14:39:12	The fact that people are more excited about snow than our new signings says a lot
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-28 20:14:48	What a goal that is
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-31 14:22:42	I do not understand what Webster is doing to continually get picked, esp when Johnson is easily our best CB out of position #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-31 15:17:11	Please don't say MK Dons go up #FranchiseFc
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-31 15:27:36	YES THEN CITY!
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-31 11:41:55	Season tickets sales are going to be scarily low if nothing  changes. Wake up @Coventry_City the club is dying
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-31 12:49:32	My @Super6: PAL 1-1 EVT, LIV 1-1 WHA, MNU 2-0 LEI, STO 2-0 QPR, SUN 1-1 BUR, WBA 0-1 TOT http://t.co/BWrkz5oJdf #Super6
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-31 16:57:13	MK Dons really need to go out of business
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-01-31 18:11:54	Watching the Chelsea game in the bar. Glory supporters everywhere.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-02 12:16:11	WE'VE ACTUALLY SIGNED A WINGER, AND HE'S NOT ON LOAN 🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-02 12:18:13	@RichBanbrook35 we don't ask for too much on deadline day!
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-02 12:18:43	@RichBanbrook35 but need a big cdm who will just kick people
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-02 12:20:43	@RichBanbrook35 Oh you're doing it are you? He'd be perfect
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-02 12:29:34	@RichBanbrook35 amazing! Could be a heavy night. So technically you should have started already? #session
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-01 13:46:33	We can take comfort from the fact that the only team that is worse to support than Coventry at the moment is Aston villa #SOTV
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-01 15:03:33	Villa are so bad 😂😂
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-04 15:54:29	Remember when United signed the wonderkids of Nani and Anderson? That worked out well.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-05 13:31:22	How can 10% of voters actually want SISU to stay?!
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-05 13:37:54	@BenjaminWillsSJ @TeleFootball didn't know whether to be proud or ashamed
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-05 15:25:33	Letter to Tim Fisher is pretty well written I think. Fuck off SISU.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-05 16:46:36	That's Reda gone in the summer, can't afford to pay the wages of a player who plays less than half of the games, no matter how influential
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-06 13:43:14	Another classic lecture of scrolling through twitter far too frequently...
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-07 13:02:32	My @Super6: AST 0-3 CHE, LEI 1-1 PAL, MNC 5-0 HUL, QPR 0-1 SOU, SWA 2-0 SUN, WGN 1-3 BOR http://t.co/BWrkz4xVP3 #Super6
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-07 17:21:21	One Fleetwood goal cost me £120. Just fuck off football
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-07 17:21:50	And a Coventry defeat means the usual Saturday #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-07 17:34:00	SISU protest need to be relentless, they are responsible for the death of our football club
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-07 18:02:44	Just utterly depressing being a @Coventry_City fan
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-06 16:49:54	Hahaha wait till arsenal fans see how shit Akpom is
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-06 22:39:17	I watched a whole game of rugby and even got a little excited. I hope people are proud
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-06 22:39:41	Wasps can still fuck off though
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-08 14:21:45	I'm a big fan of the classic Football Manager pun, but this is absolutely shocking http://t.co/zRYNqSvEiT
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-10 23:06:07	Coventry city are dying. Simple as. SISU OUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-11 23:03:45	@elysia_lind @ASFCofficial EXACTLY
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-12 12:46:08	@elysia_lind I am feeling your pain as we speak
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-12 13:09:49	@elysia_lind OK probably shouldn't complain, I only have 8 hours all week 😂
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-12 13:13:23	@elysia_lind I feel like I deserve it though?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-12 13:15:03	@elysia_lind because... Sixth form was tough, and it may possibly pick up at some point in the 3 years idk
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-12 13:17:05	@elysia_lind the videos were the ultimate intellectual challenge
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-10 19:42:19	When you take a step back and look at everything, Coventry City is on its knees #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-10 21:22:59	Pressley, think you may have 10 minutes to save your job #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-10 21:24:55	Still think he's being used as a scapegoat to a certain extent when SISU are the destroyers of this club
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-10 21:26:41	At least I'm getting smashed tonight to forget about all this
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-10 21:41:12	@elysia_lind fine, TUDGAY SCORES WE'RE GETTING SMASHED
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-10 21:55:57	@elysia_lind I will do x
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-13 16:37:13	@MKDonsFC @Coventry_City you pathetic joke of a club.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-15 14:01:34	If villa score against you you should be automatically relegated
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-15 19:07:12	Callum Wilson to Chelsea for £15m? A lot has changed in 18 months
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-16 12:20:39	@ImALannyFicker @MKDonsFC @Coventry_City check your facts pal
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-16 16:03:21	Hope Wilson does not get sold, desperately need to starve SISU of any sort of income #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-19 12:52:27	What happened to the defensive midfielder who we were due to sign in deadline day?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-21 15:21:17	Please don't blow this priceless opportunity city.. #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-21 15:35:24	YES BOYSSS
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-21 15:39:26	Bottom 5 all winning at present, don't see that very often
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-21 16:15:29	It would be typical Coventry city if we blow this
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-21 16:19:25	@DanieIChapman you're halfway to being a fully fledged sky blue now you've said that
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-21 16:24:55	@DanieIChapman too long to go for me to be happy yet, sounds like you're in with a shout
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-21 16:29:30	@DanieIChapman yeah definitely thanks to that twat Barton
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-21 16:57:39	Absolutely pathetic, stand up and be counted, or relegation is real
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-21 16:58:58	To blow a 2goal lead with 10 minutes to go against 10 men is unacceptable regardless of who you are playing
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-21 17:04:42	Pressley has lost the fans. Don't think he's got long. A defeat next week could seal his fate
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-21 17:08:15	@DanieIChapman and football takes the painfully inevitable turn for the worst just like it does every fucking weekend
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-21 17:14:36	Called it. http://t.co/ySe7fLpyeh
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-21 18:06:15	@Coventry_City @SUFCOfficial you are aware this is the Scunthorpe twitter account right?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-21 21:19:41	Well time to drown my sorrows
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-23 10:50:09	For all those who wanted SP to go, when we end up with Hockaday maybe you will change your mind #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-23 10:57:59	A good guy gone, yet the scumbags still remain, people seem to forget that. #SISUOUT
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-23 11:10:24	@RichBanbrook35 I'm not so convinced, but can understand the decision
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-23 11:12:21	@RichBanbrook35 I am sure we shall debate this for the rest of the day!
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-23 11:14:26	@RichBanbrook35 that is true, will probably be the right call in the short term
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-24 19:18:15	Imagine Dragons with the boys. Sweet.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-23 14:59:16	I get a horrible feeling we will go through the whole Andy Thorn scenario all over again..
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-25 21:38:29	Imagine paying £40m for Mesut Ozil. Embrassingly overrated
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-26 16:28:12	@SkyBet Gary McSheffrey #WhoAreYa
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-25 16:38:58	Would have loved SP to have absolutely ripped into SISU in his statement #sisuout
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-25 21:15:49	Can't wait for Claude's interview tonight
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-27 11:18:52	How can Waggott claim SP had complete control of transfers if we're making signings without a manager?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-28 14:23:07	My @Super6: BUR 1-1 SWA, MNU 2-0 SUN, NEW 2-0 AST, STO 1-1 HUL, WBA 1-3 SOU, WED 0-2 MID http://t.co/BWrkz4xVP3 #Super6

406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-28 15:12:16	It would be so so satisfying to beat the franchise scum #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-28 15:13:47	GET IN THERE
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-28 17:03:34	Great stuff from Lee Burge! Shows a hell of a lot of character #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-28 17:10:59	I hate MK Dons with such a passion, it make victory so much sweeter
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-28 17:13:20	@4everaSkyBlue cause they shouldn't exist
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-28 17:18:35	@4everaSkyBlue I don't think they should be there, I will never go and watch them
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-02-28 18:11:12	@4everaSkyBlue that is true, but I still disagree with them being here

406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-02 16:11:04	@TheBaggiesWay no words needed http://t.co/k7FSXfmZjZ
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-02 23:32:14	Still 1/20 for Mowbray to get the job on SkyBet. Could just throw all the money I have on it
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-03 12:03:37	Me and Tony Mowbray go back a long way. I met him once in the toilets of a restaurant #claimtofame
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-03 13:29:23	If both Mowbray and the club have intentions of signing a longer deal in the summer after survival I've got no problem with the situation
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-02 12:08:48	Delighted that it looks like Mowbray is the man. Absolutely shocked that any respected manager is prepared to work with SISU though
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-03 13:49:29	Mowbray is targeting the play-offs. Bloody hell.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-03 13:58:27	@Tomkins72 me too, he sounded like he wanted to stick around as well, not that you would expect any different
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-03 14:01:22	@RichBanbrook35 I can totally understand why they've done it, be disappointed if we stay up and he leaves however
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-03 14:09:12	@RichBanbrook35 Well they won't be giving out any more 4 year deals in a hurry
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-03 14:30:43	I would love to be going to Barnsley tonight #tonymowbraysplayoffpush
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-02 12:17:36	@ccfcfan I agree, I imagine he'll be expecting to keep us up this year, and them compete at the right end next season,
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-03 19:10:44	I'm almost uncomfortable with this positivity surrounding Coventry City
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-06 17:54:22	@_CharlieHarris Sheffield United mate
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-06 18:07:23	@_CharlieHarris haha you were nearly onto something there
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-06 18:08:28	Well this looks 100% legit http://t.co/h1HkiPDFFr
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-07 12:42:21	Must win game today, come on you mighty sky blues
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-07 17:06:33	Totally unacceptable #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-07 17:15:37	@AndyTurnerccfc do you know what the attendance was today? #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-07 17:38:01	@jeffconquest @AndyTurnerccfc OK cheers
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-08 21:53:00	The new MLS logo looks like a league that football manager don't have licensing for
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-10 19:43:37	If we lose I blame Wasps
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-10 19:43:47	@TomPercival2 and SISU of course
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-13 13:34:56	What a lovely day to spend 4 hours on a coach...
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-12 21:18:54	@CovTel_CCFC desperately need a holding midfielder
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-12 21:36:53	Just found a video of Mr huxford  carrying a toy camel round a history lesson last year #hero
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-14 11:33:06	@elysia_lind are you in cov this weekend?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-14 11:52:31	@elysia_lind me too, how exciting. You going to colly tonight?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-14 12:07:50	@elysia_lind I'm with the boys who are potentially going, but I have no idea about anyone else
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-14 12:40:44	My @Super6: ARS 3-0 WHA, LEI 1-1 HUL, SUN 0-0 AST, WBA 1-2 STO, BOR 4-0 BLP, NOR 3-2 DER http://t.co/BWrkz4xVP3 #Super6
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-14 13:30:19	@elysia_lind haha very true, have to appreciate these few days of luxury
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-14 13:58:33	@DanieIChapman yes please
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-16 10:37:29	Ricketts would be a great signing #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-17 17:27:06	Huge credit to those going up to Fleetwood tonight. Proper fans. #PUSB
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-18 20:20:41	It is moments like that which make Messi a better player than Ronaldo
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-19 18:37:06	I made the fatal mistake of clicking on #HaveAGoodRestZayn and have now lost all faith in humanity
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-17 20:23:23	Twitter I don't give a shit about arsenal...
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-17 21:15:51	Come on you sky blues!
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-19 12:31:18	Unbelievable that Smalling and Jones are still being picked. Welbeck a joke too.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-19 12:32:33	We will never be successful if we continue to pick players based on the fact they play for a big club regardless of ability
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-19 23:01:15	I don't even care I love Pressley
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-17 21:45:13	THERE IS ONLY ONE TONY MOWBRAY
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-21 14:05:21	Poor attempt on retro day, all my vaguely old city shirts are far too small
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-21 16:48:25	Clarke-Harris is blatantly the next leon Clarke
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-21 16:50:34	Fucking useless
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-21 17:02:47	Doncaster fans singing Coventry is a shit hole and they want to go home. To Doncaster.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-21 17:07:32	That game pretty much sums up my experience of supporting Coventry city
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-21 17:12:18	Nouble, Stokes and Martin were absolutely piss poor today
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-21 17:22:49	@emmerryweather all I'll say is that it is not generally regarded as a place of beauty 😂
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-20 17:12:36	Buzzing to be back in Coventry tomorrow for the Doncaster game. It's been too long #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-20 17:34:54	@harryperc_ I saw you last week, you're not that special. #banter
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-21 20:53:53	Why do people bet on Milan? They're so average
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-24 19:40:55	Wouldn't go anywhere near Alex Nimely, shocked that so many fans want him #ccfc
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-24 21:13:46	My decision to download a snazzy FM skin has backfired massively when it comes to identifying Gael Bigirimana http://t.co/4Dpcg8Qvop
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-25 16:52:58	Just imagine these two on the same TV show together. We can only dream http://t.co/e8xnVD9EMQ
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-25 17:46:30	There are some seriously sad, pathetic and disturbed people out there. Grow up its a fucking band.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-25 17:47:14	And to think I handled the move to sixfields badly #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-26 15:21:33	@reeee1993 @Coventry_City we have never really had a chance to see him play, injured and consistently down the pecking order
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-26 20:12:25	@AWhitehead95 @reeee1993 I would have liked to seen him given a run but never seemed to happy. Imagine he'll score goals in L2
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-28 16:32:20	GET IN THERE LADS
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-28 17:05:53	Massive win that, got to hope with the easy-ish run in we have that relegation nerves can be wiped away relatively quickly #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-30 14:00:47	A day of illness means a day of Alan Partridge
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-03-31 15:54:59	I scored 20/20 in the CovTel League One teaser quiz, can you match me? http://t.co/KQdWHJiBGg @covtelegraph
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-01 11:32:29	Absolute top class banter on Google maps http://t.co/sW9yNQNawM
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-01 16:48:44	Win tonight and safe? #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-01 16:58:37	Why are we actually playing tonight? There are no other fixtures
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-01 17:23:43	@Anthony_Hornsby yes you're probably right. Especially with our run in, if we lost it means points are being gained by the teams below us
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-01 17:26:47	@Anthony_Hornsby I'll be fuming if we get relegated from this position, 2 wins should be easily obtainable
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-01 20:47:18	Fuck this
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-01 20:47:34	How have we lost that?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-01 20:48:33	Orient were absolutely abysmal, yet again lost to a shit side
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-01 20:53:45	See you all next Saturday 😂 #PUSB
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-02 13:48:08	Samuel done. Fuck.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-02 18:05:53	@ashccfc10 @JoeyCoombes the ricoh is too big for a club with SISU at the helm
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-02 18:08:37	@ashccfc10 @JoeyCoombes no but it is a club that should realistically get PL football every now and then. A successful side would get 25k+
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-03 23:30:06	Feel like I'm pretty much the only one that's not out tonight
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-04 10:07:44	My @Super6: EVT 1-1 SOU, LEI 0-2 WHA, MNU 4-0 AST, SWA 2-1 HUL, WBA 1-0 QPR, LEE 2-2 BLB http://t.co/BWrkz4xVP3 #Super6
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-04 17:15:08	Unbelievable goal
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-06 09:01:29	Nothing beats an away day #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-06 11:38:47	Arrived for a few pints before a massive game #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-03 10:23:42	Might want to get the right player next time @BBCSport http://t.co/TavEdfVpMT
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-07 19:20:11	Sherwood is such a twat

406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-09 18:21:14	What is up with this twitter update?!
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-11 16:20:38	Maddison looks like he could be a top, top player #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-14 18:13:49	So much more reassuring have reda Johnson playing #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-14 14:55:52	@FootballCliches personally I think zola looks great #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-18 14:12:11	10 mins down, 80 to go... #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-18 14:16:11	Oh fuck off Leicester
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-18 14:24:31	Feel horrible for cheering an MK Dons goal...
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-18 15:57:41	Great point boys, very nearly there #PUSB
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-18 16:06:23	As if we broke a club record in the most miserable of seasons
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-18 16:08:04	Bristol City is an example of what a little bit of investment and ambition can do in this terrible league. Take note SISU
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-17 17:58:14	Got a sneaky feeling we will fuck up all accumulators tomorrow #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-19 13:52:46	One of the first times I have hoped for Liverpool success #SOTV
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-19 15:53:19	Mowbray &gt; Sherwood
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-21 17:00:46	Resisted the urge to have a campus kitchen. The sign of a true hero.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-21 13:36:35	You have got to be kidding me http://t.co/Zijsbax0i7
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-21 13:40:01	@DC96_ i would actually disown them if that happened
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-21 13:42:31	@DC96_ ahahaha not a chance with a twat like that in charge
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-21 13:48:08	@Charchisio if this is a sign of the future i quit being a Coventry supporter, don't think i could handle that
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-21 13:54:01	@DC96_ the sondico was the only thing holding us back
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-21 19:39:20	Results staying as they are would be absolutely fantastic #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-21 20:48:38	Refuse to celebrate Coventry effectively staying up in the third division. How far have we fallen.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-21 20:58:52	@ccfcfan @LouisMc89 we are so much better than this. Season has to be regarded as awful, not a celebration
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-25 15:00:30	You may as well just give Crewe 6 points at the start of every season
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-25 16:10:41	Cant wait to get relegated against a shit side in a shit stadium from a shit league next week
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-25 16:15:36	@RichBanbrook35 should be the only word on the back page of the Coventry telegraph tomorrow
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-25 16:17:39	@RichBanbrook35 i thought we would be able to relax! Guess we forget this is Coventry city..
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-27 19:34:38	Bournemouth could potentially be 3 leagues higher than Coventry next season. What is football
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-27 21:42:31	Burnley going up was more of an achievement than Bournemouth in my opinion
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-29 12:31:35	10 years since Highfield Road. What a truly miserable decade it has been
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-04-29 12:56:59	The lad that is @DC96_ http://t.co/917MbUdyFX
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-01 20:43:19	TM is absolutely right. Hate Wasps with a passion
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-03 13:30:48	Bring back terracing, makes such a good atmosphere
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-03 13:31:22	Great game, poor season. Much work ahead #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-03 14:21:49	@MatthewKeady truly honoured to have my hand in your twitter picture
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-04 17:53:19	@DC96_ mate it is in the afternoon, it's all good
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-04 17:55:09	@DC96_ yeah its an absolute joke, i say we boycott in protest, would also a hide a distinct lack of revision
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-04 17:56:43	@DC96_ same here, don't know why im not worried that it could quite easily go completely tits up though
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-05 10:16:44	Brilliant stuff from Mowbray. Finally someone who is challenging SISU's appalling running of this football club.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-05 17:07:01	Maghoma would do a job for us next season
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-05 18:09:19	@LouisMc89 yeah im sure he was, and yes been released, think he would do a great job in league 1
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-06 20:24:56	If you think Ronaldo is better than Messi you are talking out of your arse
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-07 16:28:26	Play offs then election. Revision may be pretty absent tonight
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-07 15:11:40	Still cant get over the fact that i have a politics exam the day after the general election
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-07 20:39:52	Sheffield United continue to bottle the play offs
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-08 18:35:57	Would be great if Ann Lucas went
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-08 11:16:13	Another leader bites the dust
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-09 18:53:54	@RichBanbrook35 but regardless of that, them being in Coventry is fundamentally wrong
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-09 20:40:08	@RichBanbrook35 that's not our problem. They will never be welcome in Coventry as far as i am concerned
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-09 18:28:22	I just cannot understand why the people of Coventry are so welcoming to Wasps. Clearly in the minority thinking it is an absolute disgrace
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-10 10:21:05	We may as well just roll back the years and sign Joe Murphy, Leon Clarke and Martin Cranie this summer
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-10 10:23:08	These riots are absolutely ridiculous. We live in a democracy, the people have spoken, throwing a tantrum doesn't change anything
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-10 10:30:31	@niallc176 actually i would take all 3, they would all get into this team
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-10 10:44:18	@ashccfc10 loved Keogh but we have no chance of signing him, Cranie is a free agent i think
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-10 10:46:29	@ashccfc10 true but he has been playing League 1 for a season
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-10 11:32:13	@niallc176 @ashccfc10 i know, i would still take a punt on him though with reasonable wage demands
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-10 13:48:29	Hate the fact that people don't rate Robert Green purely because of one mistake 5 years ago
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-11 15:56:35	We are putting an awful lot of pressure on Maddison for next season considering he is 18 years old...
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-10 15:30:44	Still find it bizarre that Chelsea fans can mock a player over slipping.... http://t.co/VdQswmcB88
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-11 20:32:27	First game of the play-offs I miss, and it is 5-3. Wonderful
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-11 23:12:59	I seriously need to get on the Game of Thrones hype
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-11 23:13:54	@DC96_ I'm tempted to start it  now
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-10 18:26:39	I had actually forgotten Gary Deegan existed
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-12 11:03:07	@DC96_ series 1 ep 1 done, I'm catching up
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-12 11:11:16	@DC96_ be there in no time
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-12 11:21:01	Got a horrible feeling this Tony Mowbray situation will turn into the Marlon King fiasco all over again. Get the contract signed!
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-12 11:21:36	@DC96_ absolutely no problem, not as if I have an exam or anything
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-12 17:30:14	This is Coventry city, im still waiting for things to go wrong

406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-14 20:12:53	I pretty much support any team that plays against Westley
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-15 20:20:34	Brentford will get relegated next season
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-16 11:21:29	Can people stop taking the piss out of Gerrard for just one day and give him the respect that he deserves?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-16 12:14:21	So Tim Sherwood's smug look has vanished then?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-16 12:14:39	This is back to the Villa we know and love
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-15 12:46:48	How does it take the best part of 2 weeks to get this contract sorted out?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-17 18:48:03	I scored 17/20 in the CovTel Coventry City end of season quiz  quiz, can you beat me? http://t.co/I3e2imv5D8 @covtelegraph
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-17 18:48:58	I should probably get out more....
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-17 19:47:01	What an abysmal effort at a pun ffs http://t.co/3zec8Cqvlw
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-17 19:51:13	@HaarryB_ I know, they make me laugh every time though
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-19 07:19:43	Forgot what this time of day looked like...
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-19 07:35:13	@DanChapmn won't forget this time
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-19 07:37:34	@DanChapmn although now you'e made me not sure. May leave now to be safe
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-18 16:26:13	Please just make the announcement ffs
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-19 10:43:27	1st year of university finished, how is that even possible
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-19 10:45:13	Still don't know if I would have kept Nouble or not, agree with all the others #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-19 10:48:16	@GeorgeLankester his fall down the leagues continues
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-18 18:08:32	THANK FUCK FOR THAT #TonyMowbraysSkyBlueArmy
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-19 21:06:06	Just been beaten by Leicester as Coventry on FIFA. I apologise to all ccfc fans #wegoagain
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-21 12:05:07	How the fuck does Jamie Vardy get it into the England squad? Bar a few games he has been shite
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-21 17:46:07	Seething. What a bunch of bottlejobs http://t.co/SjxVmkfvwS
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-22 19:50:10	Please have a look at this petition, it means a lot to me: http://t.co/WZjgSSlxzf via @38_degrees
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-22 13:09:49	I got stung by a wasp on the nipple and now it looks like i have a breast
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-23 15:04:04	Half hour detour to get onto campus 👌👍🎉🎊💯
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-23 16:21:12	A trip to Southend would be preferable for next season
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-23 19:50:26	@RichBanbrook35 we can use our contacts with the big man to arrange corporate hospitality at Roots Hall
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-23 19:51:28	@RichBanbrook35 that is Phil Brown not God by the way,if there is a difference
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-23 19:54:48	@RichBanbrook35 oh god youre right, he probably applied for the job about 20 times. For sure,that's a priority
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-22 15:14:08	@LNR_bickers it is situations such as these that propel me up the social ladder somehow
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-22 15:23:08	@LNR_bickers it really is. We're going to Croatia on the 18th  I'm so sorry. Is that when you finish exams?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-22 15:28:15	@LNR_bickers quite possibly to be fair, it would be great to get in this time...
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-23 18:35:59	This has been absolutely dire. Penalties please
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-23 18:40:48	@TomPercival2 or that
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-24 14:34:51	What a player Frank Lampard is
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-24 14:52:54	Imagine being a glory supporter and picking Liverpool 😂
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-24 15:16:17	So as it stands the 'hero' Tim Sherwood has led Villa from 18th to 17th...
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-24 15:50:46	West Ham could have made this more interesting, they've been abysmal
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-24 15:58:52	Didn't take West Ham long
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-24 19:08:58	DJ Fresh tonight, decent
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-24 19:10:27	Thank God we don't have to go to Deepdale next year, absolutely useless record there
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-25 14:32:30	Surely the main motivation to get out of the Championship is to not have to listen to Sky's shit Football League commentators
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-25 14:36:41	@DanChapmn hahahahha my god, honestly he was so bad for us, I don't understand why he isn't non-league by now
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-25 23:36:08	@DanChapmn I'm not sure anything can beat the Sugar Hut
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-25 23:38:02	@DanChapmn Honestly I'm desperate to go, I'm pretty sure @MatthewKeady is too
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-25 23:42:43	@DanChapmn @MatthewKeady @david_walsh101 I'm pretty sure he never checks Twitter haha
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-25 23:45:33	@DanChapmn @MatthewKeady It's just the greatest name for a club I have ever heard
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-25 02:17:46	DJ Fresh was fucking amazing
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-25 13:14:22	Hangover session of Fawlty Towers, parents would be proud
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-25 13:31:12	Konstantopolous is one game away from being a Premier League goalkeeper, what is life
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-25 14:08:39	Getting to a Play-Off final must be unbelievable
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-26 18:34:37	On the Frosty Jacks tonight - I have hit a new low.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-26 20:52:13	@RichBanbrook35 what do I get for coming up with the name?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-26 21:01:47	@RichBanbrook35 I would prefer sexual favours?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-25 23:32:29	Is it weird that I am kind of looking forward to going back to Colly?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-25 23:34:06	@DanChapmn club in Coventry that will probably return to being shit after a few visits
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-27 12:57:10	Do I just savour this unusual period of optimism and bet on us to win the title at 25/1?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-28 21:51:33	@elysia_lind what a tweet that is
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-28 21:58:29	@elysia_lind oh so I have, far too long
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-28 18:57:55	Anyone got an Arsenal shirt I can borrow for the Cup Final? #SOTV
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-28 18:59:55	@DanChapmn some of us have to rely on other teams failures rather than our own success. It's the only pleasure I can get out of football
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-29 17:35:47	Football is fucked
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-30 14:48:32	Absolutely love the FA Cup
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-29 21:00:01	Istanbul-esque scenes during FIFA pre's
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-30 17:47:09	Sanchez is unreal
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-30 16:30:05	Come on Arsenal!
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-30 16:55:24	Villa are going to win this through some absolute bullshit
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-30 17:51:24	Hahahahahaha this is getting embarrassing
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-05-30 21:52:53	Just seen the Messi goal. What an incredible player
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-01 22:33:21	Keep finding decent songs by The Kooks
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-01 23:40:35	Can we all just take a moment before it goes tits up #RoadToEuro2016 http://t.co/lJC0yYG7CK
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-01 23:45:50	@TomPercival2 lost 2-1, they only had 51 shots. Gutted.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-02 22:17:55	@DanChapmn as if that is important
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-01 12:30:51	Some of the transfer targets fans identify are absolutely stupid
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-01 12:45:23	Just began the FM San Marino challenge, rip social life
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-02 10:52:31	@rachy1235 @RichBanbrook35 I take partial responsibility. We just can't help ourselves
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-02 11:30:22	@RichBanbrook35 @rachy1235 sadly my phone broke so I have lost the beloved rape face photo
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-02 11:40:25	@RichBanbrook35 @rachy1235 ffs, i was talking about yours
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-02 11:47:09	@RichBanbrook35 @rachy1235 STOP PLEASE GOD
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-02 12:32:06	2 weeks to Croatia, can't wait
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-02 14:49:46	England are absolutely shite
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-02 15:03:17	@RichBanbrook35 they seem to collapse at an alarmingly regular basis. Get rid of Broad. Yeah I liked Taylor
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-02 16:14:47	Far happier having Mowbray than I would have been with Adkins
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-02 16:40:12	https://t.co/aT8NvaaoC4
Just watched this again, good times
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-03 13:25:24	How the hell has Benitez managed to land the Real job
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-02 16:48:51	SISU next please
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-02 18:48:36	If we get hold of a younger, hungrier strike with a similar amount of goals in him, that is far more preferable over Leon Clarke
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-02 19:33:38	@DanChapmn bullshit. Have I ever had to be carried into bed?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-02 19:34:55	Leon Clarke has an alternative interpretation of what completing the 92 means... #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-04 13:03:38	Packing up my room to go home on Saturday. Emotional stuff.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-06 17:18:44	BBQ first evening back home. Class.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-06 18:50:44	Come on Juve
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-06 20:02:32	Get in there Morata
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-06 20:02:53	What a backheel that was
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-06 20:19:12	@JakeBland44 yeah, boring if Barca win
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-06 20:40:23	Suarez can fuck off. Miserable excuse of a human being
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-06 20:40:45	@4everaSkyBlue where is that from?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-06 20:44:40	@leonard_shayler he is an absolute scumbag, regardless of ability
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-06 20:50:55	@leonard_shayler yeah hahah i think so. As far as I am concerned the things he has done are unforgivable
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-06 21:07:18	@leonard_shayler yeah its the way of football fans. I chanted the name of Marlon King ffs
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-06 21:17:50	Xavi with a slightly better send off than Steven Gerrard...
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-07 21:06:23	How are they allowed to sign players? https://t.co/fEEBdel6bT
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-08 13:20:29	The Kenilworth Road being closed is going to be a huge pain in the arse
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-08 13:56:18	@_CharlieHarris from what I understand its basically the bit past Warwick uni into Kenilworth
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-08 13:57:00	@RichBanbrook35 absolute nightmare for you! Why didn't they do it the last 2 months haha
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-07 11:04:17	Another terrible team selection from England
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-08 14:31:08	@_CharlieHarris bit of a pain because I do drive into Kenilworth fairly regularly
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-07 21:46:28	@leonard_shayler @FCBarcelona I swear it was supposed to be a 2 year ban though?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-09 16:51:37	Those last 10 overs were absolutely incredible
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-09 17:21:44	@RichBanbrook35 Don't you dare let Rory take away the limelight from my heroic innings
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-09 17:23:17	@RichBanbrook35 yeah never played since although Dad is getting on my case...
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-09 17:25:08	@RichBanbrook35 I'm pretty sure I didn't drop another catch, you just choose to remember that one moment...
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-09 17:53:05	@RichBanbrook35 you actually did I remember that
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-10 16:58:34	@alexcambridge95 HAHAHAHA YES. was he retrieved in the end?
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-10 17:04:09	For the first time ever, actually kind of upset to miss Godiva this year
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-10 17:25:37	@alexcambridge95 I don't think I can go back to UEA if Carl isn't
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-11 12:13:26	Worrying signs coming from Cov, no signings or even rumours as of yet, and talk of a load of loan players.
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-14 16:43:50	John Terry back please
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-14 16:44:39	Lol Welsh fans mocking because I forgot how regularly they qualify for international tournaments
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-14 16:47:27	If Jones and Smalling didn't play for United they would be absolutely nowhere near the England squad
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-12 13:33:36	Premier League years 👌
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-13 16:37:19	Why am i wasting my life watching this game
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-15 10:52:27	We will blatantly get Crewe at home on the first day, kicking off with a tasty 0-3 defeat #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-15 12:57:52	Not as opposed as some to us signing Proshwitz, after a pre-season he may be a completely different player #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-14 15:13:01	If Vardy comes on instead of Austin again I will no longer support England
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-15 14:39:34	@Coventry_City easy passage with QPR away please @DanChapmn
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-15 16:59:54	Nouble off to China, what a wasted talent
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-16 13:07:20	Getting an affiliation with Spurs would be massive, has benefited Swindon hugely over recent years #pusb
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-16 20:32:47	Why does anyone give a shit who is on the cover of a video game
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-17 08:19:43	Think it will be good to play Wigan early doors to be honest,they may not hit the ground running immeadiately
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-18 16:40:35	@DanChapmn literally what are the chances
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-19 17:08:58	More season tickets will only be sold when SIGNINGS ARE ACTUALLY MADE
406335246	TomPercival2	2015-06-18 12:47:38	Well Zagreb is pretty decent http://t.co/KL79PieR3E
