423932461	Jdwill_	2013-09-02 02:58:53	I just wish you could've seen what it did to me in the first place. Did you even feel bad before today?
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-09-02 03:01:51	Now it's all over and there's no way to take it back and I'm just sitting here in pieces
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-09-02 14:11:21	I don't want to get out of bed
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-09-05 11:45:43	Why do I even bother

423932461	Jdwill_	2013-09-02 21:41:06	I just need to remember life goes on
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-09-03 19:18:53	This is still so terrible. But I'll get through it. And it won't be easy for either of us. But if it's meant to be it'll happen

423932461	Jdwill_	2013-09-20 16:12:07	I managed to not contact you for a whole day. Small victories I guess.

423932461	Jdwill_	2013-09-18 04:43:25	I don't want to feel alone.
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-09-18 04:45:28	It's only been a day but three years of telling you everything just stopped and I don't know what to do with myself
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-09-18 04:47:56	And it just especially sucks because it was completely your fault
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-09-18 20:24:22	Just when I think Mrs. Mowry can't get any cooler, I find out she used to be on a dci color guard. Holy cow she is officially my role model

423932461	Jdwill_	2013-09-21 13:51:02	AND THEN I remembered we have a competition and I still have to go to the school. But not until 12 so it's fine.
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-09-21 13:53:11	I don't want to see your face today. Why do you have to be at all the same competitions

423932461	Jdwill_	2013-09-24 14:32:31	I'm just really proud to be a part of this group. It's refreshing to be with so many people who care about the same thing!
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-09-24 14:40:12	There isn't one person in this class that is considering going into the same field as another. That is so cool!

423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-26 03:01:10	I'm surprised about the beech game score to the point that I thought there was a typo in that tweet
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-26 13:40:38	I'm too excited about today oh my goodness
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-27 20:38:04	I hate you for ruining so many things
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-27 21:17:47	I just wanna lay around, watch breaking bad and drink apple cider. Any takers?
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-27 12:20:23	If I could skip today that would be awesome
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-27 12:20:55	Like if I could go to bed right now and not have to wake up until tomorrow morning
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-26 18:05:19	@hmhaynes97 NOPE
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-27 13:57:50	Lol at Jacob and his girlfriend's face in this. Had so much fun last night though http://t.co/Xao6Tjs2Ml

423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-28 03:58:13	I never get excited about Monday's, but I'm excited about tomorrow
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-28 04:02:48	@brittannyannn he told me the whole story already. Apparently that sandwich was lifechanging to him idk
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-29 02:30:53	This picture kills me. @DanielThe1Ring http://t.co/uNR3QgbkA6
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-29 03:51:59	Feeling feelings I've been trying to keep from feeling for almost two months
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-29 03:52:14	That made no sense
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-29 03:53:01	The word random can ruin so many potentially funny statements
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-29 03:57:53	@jgshuck awuhhh. Thank you so much! :))
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-29 20:55:20	I'm so bored right now
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-29 19:18:39	Do you ever just try to quote orchestrated music on twitter and then you're like oh yeah...
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-28 20:53:35	Soooooo I guess I'm going to long hollow tonight. Weird turn of events
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-29 18:58:55	Lol at Sam trying to text me from the inside of his tuba
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-29 18:59:08	That is way too funny
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-29 19:07:19	Someone go do something with me tonight D:
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-30 11:54:37	I GUESS YOU COULD SAY I HAVE THE BEST DAD EVER. Thanks @BenWilli52 http://t.co/uvWgMFfT2R
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-01 04:50:54	Today was so great though I don't want to fall asleep yet D:
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-10-30 22:11:11	@KatKeahey WHAT

423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-01 19:54:43	So the band director just told Sam I wouldn't date him if he keeps leaving his music in the band room.. in front of the whole band
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-01 22:32:47	Unattractive game day faces http://t.co/lgPruzQ3hZ
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-03 23:17:17	Church bums with this hottie @ Gallatin First United Methodist Church http://t.co/r6BAxKJvi5

423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-07 15:14:44	It's weird to think I'm almost done with school. Just 3 semesters left and then I have to start the next chapter.
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-07 15:16:32	I still feel like I'm a little kid.
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-10 19:28:58	@shelbydiane0210 well it wasn't swollen by the time we got to his house so it turned out okay haha. Love you girl!

423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-09 05:54:29	Every part of today had just been perfect :)
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-09 19:12:52	You know life sucks when you cut your lip open with a flag right before you go to Nashville with your boyfriend's family
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-09 20:03:13	So I guess I'm a Trevecca fan today
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-12 03:28:06	A tad late but happy veterans day to my crazy hardcore retired colonel dad. Thanks for not just… http://t.co/S2e1nUErNK

423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-12 13:03:43	The other day I found out Sam drinks black coffee and I'm still tripping out
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-12 13:04:22	Black coffee. And then I'm over here like yeah can you put a gallon of milk in that thanks
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-12 22:00:30	@brittannyannn does it count if I made someone in my class vote for you? YEAH IT DOES

423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-15 23:06:40	Tennessee really is a beautiful place. And this is coming from someone who's lived on the other side of the world.
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-18 13:08:21	@myshipssailing my mom touched the cotton bag with an employee 2 feet away

423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-15 12:31:49	Heartbreaking goodbye with my bed right now because I'm not getting home until 2am
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-15 13:05:11	@myshipssailing you realize we're going to be heading home at the same time
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-15 13:06:57	Jocelyn ruins all my tweets
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-15 13:07:13	THANKS A LOT
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-19 13:29:25	"I give up. I'm not going to school"
Ten minutes later mom comes upstairs to make sure I was kidding
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-19 13:33:38	On the brightside, at least I remembered to study cell communication last night
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-19 13:48:01	I just want to hang out with @GraceWallace592 bc she makes me laugh
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-19 23:08:03	When someone asks me to be their band kid for this picture contest I feel so important *hairflip*
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-19 23:14:58	There are pictures of Sam all over twitter today and it keeps throwing me off because he doesn't even have a twitter
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-20 02:37:04	If I've ever not worn makeup in front of you, you should feel very special because that doesn't happen often
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-21 00:39:04	Wow we're adorable. I'm in love with this picture! http://t.co/DMPQLkKhsN
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-22 20:15:22	I absolutely love hearing the band play carol of the bells. It's so beautiful
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-23 03:53:48	I really hope that Gallatin has never treated any other band the way we've been treated by other student sections.
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-23 06:01:06	Even after all those awful cold half times I still wasn't ready for the season to be over
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-23 15:28:04	@GCoscolluela that makes me so mad! What on earth could a band do to influence the game? It's even worse if it's your own students
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-23 16:26:58	I GET TO SEE SAM TODAY HECK YEAH
423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-23 16:27:25	Why do I get so excited about that..

423932461	Jdwill_	2013-11-24 02:30:54	I'm always for UT, but the rest of my family are vandy fans. This game always gets interesting at my house
