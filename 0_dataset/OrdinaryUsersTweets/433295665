433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-05-18 07:31:43	Nice little sweat-a-thon with @essexpt. #apmpersonaltraining doing #kettlebell and #plyometric circuit work.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-05-15 14:45:46	Office life makes me laugh sometimes
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-05-20 10:12:25	Should not have done weight training before this match today.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-05-20 14:21:40	Great game with @ryanmorgan5 running the show and @AbzM_87 running out of puff within 5 minutes haha
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-05-20 17:58:36	@emmaharold. Well believe it newbie....hope you enjoy work ;o)

433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-05-27 08:20:56	@emmaharold. You have missed me, don't lie
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-07 13:47:00	@emmaharold That's harsh. You owe me skittles...and a birthday drink still from April.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-07 13:40:37	@emmaharold. ah maaaaaaaan, where are my skittles?
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-11 20:07:18	This is like the #schevchenko from his milan days
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-06 19:05:39	@Nick_Gr33n. Wow, look at them. They are quality.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-14 08:48:46	@emmaharold Well done, have a cake
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-14 12:51:28	@emmaharold. Sounds delicious
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-11 19:59:00	He looks like a donkey but this is one of the rare occasions I have seen I'm not play like one #ibrahimovic
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-11 20:01:09	Of course it would be #schevchenko #ukr vs #swe #Euro2012
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-15 07:40:55	A sweaty way to start the day courtesy of @essexpt. Top session.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-15 12:23:45	@emmaharold. You were looking a little tired so I thought it was a kind gesture to offer you a caffeine boost :)
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-13 14:33:04	@Nathan_Watson. No worries my man. I will have to come see you perform soon.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-16 22:06:39	@Nick_Gr33n @ryanmorgan5. Just got home and realised I didn't bring any booze with me....or the chav antidote either
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-16 22:15:34	@ryanmorgan5 I thought #awks was a character from #cbeebies or something
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-16 22:35:32	@ryanmorgan5 @Nick_Gr33n. I'm ashamed to say that she is one of my most intelligent siblings haha
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-19 07:54:17	@Nick_Gr33n. I feel dirty already #crazydanshouseofmeat
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-19 08:28:31	@Nick_Gr33n. Indeed, also added to add on the weight trainers special for me #gymtekkers
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-18 17:31:42	@emmaharold. Yes it is matey as far as I know
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-19 20:36:39	God, we like making things difficult for ourselves #eng #euro2012
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-20 14:21:34	#inworkchatuplines from @emmaharold. Would you like some sugar?
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-21 13:35:06	@xxxxEmxxxx. @emmaharold. What has happened?
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-21 18:17:12	@emmaharold. @xxxxEmxxxx You make me sick
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-28 17:05:28	Epic match #ward vs #fish #wimbledon2012
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-24 21:25:19	For fuck sake #euro2012
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-24 21:30:31	To be fair, we were the second best team in that game. Shouldn't be getting rinsed by a 33 year old with no legs though. #euro2012
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-24 21:32:41	@emmaharold. You got to be kidding? Why wasn't you watching? Haha. Lost on penalties

433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-29 16:51:30	Just played #racetheflush and lost by the mile.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-06-29 18:31:46	Just got someone else's splashback #Eagles. #T20
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-07 18:40:07	In a pub called the white rabbit, I'm the darkest person here #ironic
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-07 19:20:58	Press the 50 quid button #InsufficientFunds
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-07 19:27:29	@emmaharold. Yep, went to the cash point like I was a billionaire trying to draw out a massive wedge #denied
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-07 19:29:03	@emmaharold. I know, what a mug
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-07 19:31:09	@emmaharold. I know :( sucks. The night is young, still going at the moment. Yours?
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-07 19:37:54	@emmaharold. Going to start calling you #Boristheanimal haha. Being back at home this early is a little lame though
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-07 19:42:41	@emmaharold true, I better do one now then
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-07 20:29:13	3 year old niece just got evicted from a wetherspoons #thuglife
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-07 20:36:27	@emmaharold. I know, she is behaving better than half the twats in here but she had to be removed.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-07 21:12:01	@emmaharold. I don't know, its the rules I guess. Or maybe its cause she is black? #racist
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-07 21:14:24	@emmaharold. Haha, I'm somewhere in kent, maidstone..I think
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-14 21:08:00	The fight that should never happen.

433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-12 07:57:16	We are aware that @Persie_Official is not in our away kit launch because he is leaving. Now report on some news we don't already know.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-23 07:16:46	Ah, when the sun is shining it does put you in a better mood.........apart from on a Monday #idontlikemondays

433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-14 19:55:25	@JodyWhellam. @Nick_Gr33n. I think I might just leave you on your own to get destroyed
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-14 20:16:28	@JodyWhellam. @Nick_Gr33n. I reckon you will be able to drag me with your massive back #silverback ;)

433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-14 18:43:54	Watching the #haye vs #chisore undercard with winkles and @danhutch whilst drinking red wine #sophisticated.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-24 07:01:11	Right, who kicked me at footie last night? Back is fooked. Come on, own up
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-14 19:13:47	@Nick_Gr33n. Not sure about lazer tag, guessing I should tell @JodyWhellam haha. Think I might give someone else the chance to finish last.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-14 19:14:14	@Nick_Gr33n. I'm up for footie though, but I aint playing in goal.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-14 19:17:08	@Nick_Gr33n. @JodyWhellam. I have a wart on my trigger finger, its an old nose picking injury that has come back haha

433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-20 08:41:15	The #reversepsychology didn't work on @essexpt. Really tough session this morning.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-20 09:32:22	@xxxxEmxxxx. You need to book up some training with @essexpt , that will get you in shape.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-20 09:38:42	@xxxxEmxxxx. @essexpt. I'm sure you can have a taster session at a very reasonable price.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-07-20 09:52:45	Never going to get bored of this album, awesome #2001

433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-08-02 20:29:55	@essexpt. I'm sure I would have remembered if you said that haha #essexfit
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-08-09 20:03:25	@emmaharold. Hope you didn't put any money on that. Bolt is unique.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-08-09 20:06:12	@emmaharold. If you won races on being cute, there would be kittens and puppies in the final haha #animalympics

433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-08-12 23:09:54	I'm guessing, from tomorrow it will now be racist for us to be proud of being British #London2012
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-08-15 18:46:56	The @Persie_Official transfer saga is over. Any of our other rivals out there need there teams strengthening? If so, contact Ivan Gazidis
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-08-18 07:16:50	Looks like its going to be another day of being bedridden. Great.
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-08-24 05:08:51	Damn you Thursday for masquerading as a Friday and making me think the weekend was already here.

433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-08-31 22:02:11	Nothing like an inactive #TransferDeadlineDay to ruin the rest of the season for me as an #Arsenal fan. Roll on 2013/2014
433295665	TheAnt_A	2012-09-05 07:45:55	Cannot be arsed to spend the day dealing with bellends #moody
