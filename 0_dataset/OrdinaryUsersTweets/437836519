437836519	bookshybooks	2014-05-14 14:25:35	@kinnareads @Amegaxi @osarpong @freduagyeman I agree. Many do have acacia trees on them but I wouldn't say all covers do.

437836519	bookshybooks	2014-07-13 11:56:06	@JacarandaBooks @udenweobinna love it. It's an awesome cover and can't wait to read it when it's out in October.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-07-13 16:26:54	@BWithBooks yeah. It's a three day festival, but today's the last day.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-07-13 16:32:55	@BWithBooks it's been amazing. But the yalc sounds like it was amazing as well. Too many literary events this weekend.

437836519	bookshybooks	2014-07-12 22:21:32	@BWithBooks it is amazing. Guessing I should stop ignoring my friend's plea to read the other two volumes.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-07-12 22:55:31	@BWithBooks can't wait to see what else you got. Sounds like you got some real treats.

437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-07 09:46:28	@kinnareads Same here. I've been trying to see which other of her books I am able to get here.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-10 14:16:14	@fatou2002 @VitabuBooks @kinnareads really? I've been hearing really good things about it. It's chilling on my shelf waiting to be read.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-08 10:27:38	@fatou2002 mine was 8 years ago and I still feel like I'm behind.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-08 10:31:37	@fatou2002 @VitabuBooks @flavorwire @_igoni it's a tough one. I think it's great that it's getting more recognition and being appreciated.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-08 10:34:12	@fatou2002 @VitabuBooks @flavorwire @_igoni &amp; maybe for some readers who may only know Achebe (&amp; now Adichie) this is new terrain.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-08 10:39:11	@fatou2002 @VitabuBooks @flavorwire @_igoni but labelling it as 'new' ignores the developments that have been happening for sometime now
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-08 10:40:37	@fatou2002 I haven't read many classics. Tutuola is on my list as is The Cairo Trilogy (which I started  and stopped).
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-08 10:58:29	@fatou2002 sadly only Maps.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-08 11:02:03	@fatou2002 any of his trilogies you recommend to begin with?
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-09 16:02:03	So I just got this :). Thanks @JacarandaBooks. Can't wait to read it. http://t.co/aM94Ttgixi
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-12 15:33:08	@AwoDeee such beautiful, beautiful covers. can't wait for part 2. and thanks for the shout out :).
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-09 19:58:00	@AfroLibrarians @BookRiot I am guilty of judging books by their covers.It's usually what attracts me to a book esp ones I've never heard of
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-09 19:59:28	@AfroLibrarians @BookRiot and if I love the cover I'm more likely to read the back.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-11 14:22:33	@fatou2002 @brittlepaper Adichie's becoming a brand &amp; happens to be stylish. Some people will gravitate towards that aspect of her identity
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-11 14:51:08	@fatou2002 @VitabuBooks @kinnareads let me know if it gets any better.Still have a few other books I want to read first before I get to it
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-11 14:53:22	@fatou2002 @EvaDomijan @brittlepaper I agree. She probably is.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-11 14:55:31	@fatou2002 @VitabuBooks @kinnareads You're a much better person than me. I sometimes don't finish books if I lose interest part way.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-11 15:02:50	@fatou2002 @VitabuBooks @kinnareads I never thought about it that way.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-11 15:06:29	@fatou2002 @VitabuBooks @kinnareads it's also my mood at that particular time. Sometimes I try to go back to it(months later) but not always
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-11 15:11:50	@fatou2002 @VitabuBooks @kinnareads that's me with too many books. Started Teju Cole's 'Open City' last summer - think I read 10 pages.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-11 15:36:13	@kinnareads @ZODML @nas009 same here :). Can't wait.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-08-11 18:10:55	@Sarabamag @WoodCowBooks no, thank you. It's such a beautiful collection and I love the artwork peppered throughout.

437836519	bookshybooks	2014-10-10 14:57:49	@NaijaWife i think it's subjective - "success" could mean diff things to diff people. Might even differ for the same person at diff stages.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-10-10 15:01:23	@NaijaWife I'm not even sure I would know how I would define it for myself.
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-10-10 15:08:08	@NaijaWife I've never defined success by money.If I did,def wouldn't have made half the choices I've made.But it def is a marker of success
437836519	bookshybooks	2014-10-10 15:09:04	@NaijaWife *it's def seen as a marker of success.

437836519	bookshybooks	2015-01-20 16:55:07	@fatou2002 @brittlepaper I read a lot of reviews on it before I watched it that made me expect the worse. It wasn't as bad some reviews said
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-01-20 17:10:10	@fatou2002 @brittlepaper I also never go into a film adaptation of a book expecting it to be an exact replica.
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-01-20 17:12:56	@fatou2002 @brittlepaper It wasn't perfect, but I actually enjoyed it. I thought Anika Noni Rose was amazing as Kainene.
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-01-20 17:16:26	@fatou2002 @brittlepaper the b&amp;w video footage of the war I appreciated a lot. It made me understand more what it would have been like then.
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-01-20 17:17:19	@fatou2002 @brittlepaper also felt, it would also enable those who may not know about the Biafran war to get a sense of it.
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-01-20 17:20:18	@fatou2002 @brittlepaper Thandie Newton's accent didn't bother me. Then again I'm not Igbo so I wouldn't even know the correct pronunciation
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-01-20 17:22:43	@fatou2002 @brittlepaper the one thing that did bother me was Ugwu - and him being less central in the movie than the book.
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-01-20 17:23:07	@fatou2002 @brittlepaper I'll stop now. Think I've gone on too long :).
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-01-20 17:25:16	@fatou2002 lol! 'Skinny Hollywood version'. Then you're not going to like my reply to your question. Actually didn't think it was that bad.
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-01-20 17:33:53	@brittlepaper I should be thanking you &amp; Eugene Odogwu. Can't wait for part 2.
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-01-21 04:57:58	@fatou2002 I was sad about how Ugwu was portrayed and also made into a bit character.
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-01-23 18:06:34	@charlhastings awesome :) you are very welcome and hope you enjoy. But it was a collaborative effort with @delemeiji

437836519	bookshybooks	2015-01-31 01:44:28	@delemeiji maybe it was wishful thinking on my part that tradition of rotating posts might not apply in this case.
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-01-31 01:57:52	@delemeiji will be interesting to see if he will push for free &amp; fair elections, but also how he will execute his mandate. Guess we'll see

437836519	bookshybooks	2015-04-13 12:44:35	First up - @KTReid in conversation with 'queen of South African crime fiction', Margie Orford. http://t.co/Ln81jds2hV
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-04-13 12:55:16	Margie Orford's works on crime fiction filters what is too overwhelming &amp; too incomprehensible about violence against women in South Africa
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-04-13 13:12:32	Margie Orford explains how through her five books she has gone through digging deeper on archives of violence in South Africa.
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-04-13 13:14:51	Themes explored in her crime fiction - what creates violence against women, military occupation, criminal gangs, origins of slavery in SA
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-04-13 13:17:55	Margie Orford chose crime fiction as a form to write about how South Africa is, rather than how it was meant to be.
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-04-13 13:54:08	Now @katehaines of @AfricainWords in conversation with Bibi Bakare-Yusuf of @CassavaRepublic and @ankarapress http://t.co/OQEcfrvAhW
437836519	bookshybooks	2015-04-13 14:19:39	@ankarapress is an opportunity to provide Africans with an image of themselves - not just of dangerous sex and HIV but of love and desire.
