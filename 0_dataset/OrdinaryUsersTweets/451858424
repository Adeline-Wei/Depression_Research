451858424	LSchmally	2013-05-03 23:45:46	Baseball game! @Briannacapone https://t.co/BBLMrVvp9y

451858424	LSchmally	2013-05-06 22:09:10	@NadiahHamid28 I apologize that was Jeffrey tweeting from my phone
451858424	LSchmally	2013-05-06 22:11:01	Jeffrey stole my phone and was tweeting from it!
451858424	LSchmally	2013-05-07 00:06:36	I love how I know exactly what Bri's tweets are about üòÇ
451858424	LSchmally	2013-05-07 01:20:06	Well I mean if I am that bad at tennis you could have just told me instead of telling me I need lessons...
451858424	LSchmally	2013-05-07 01:24:03	Honestly though I don't think I can wait any longer for Friday to come

I can tell by your eyes that you're in love with me
451858424	LSchmally	2013-05-07 03:14:39	So I think they need to delay the release date of The Great Gatsby because it comes out on the day of the Relay

451858424	LSchmally	2013-06-15 13:05:56	Watching The First Time right when I wake up automatically makes this day good
451858424	LSchmally	2013-06-15 13:09:50	This soundtrack has the most perfect music ever

451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 01:01:14	I think I'm gonna have a Favorite Movies Marathon tonight
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 01:06:14	All the hashtags they show on TV just make me laugh
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 01:36:20	I'm entertaining myself right now by watching all the AT&amp;T commercials with the little kids
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 01:39:42	Holy shit she's looking in the box
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 01:40:09	It's okay there's nothing bad in the box
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 01:41:36	You can tell if someone is a good soccer player if they have nice knees
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 01:46:36	@MeganCafarella Meg you have beautiful knees
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 01:51:19	@MeganCafarella Yes you are!
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 03:21:10	What do I do with myself at this hour of the night
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 03:23:47	Really debating on whether I should watch Pitch Perfect or Teen Wolf
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 03:24:50	@MeganCafarella Luke, you are a GENIUS!
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 03:25:25	Still wondering why Meg's name on Twitter is Luke
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 03:27:21	Oh my god I think I'm getting, DON DON DOOONNNN, A ZIT #GASP

451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-04 14:48:54	I think I have a twitter stalking problem...
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 13:28:28	Amanda Bynes is the most bipolar person in the world. I LOVE IT
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 14:10:46	Some guy that has to do with bipolar disorder just followed me because of my tweet about Amanda Bynes #yesss
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-03 21:57:21	Might have to do some hard core night swimming tonight after the fireworks
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-04 21:31:26	Catching fruit
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-01 04:06:24	The fact that I will most likely be seeing Grown Ups 2 with my entire family just makes me happy
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-06 03:08:25	Oh my goodness grashianious
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-06 03:19:04	Emojis make my life possible

451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-06 22:59:47	Doing some hardcore stalking on Facebook even though I don't have one....
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-06 23:53:03	Abi just asked Pop if she could order Chicken Porn Pizza.... k Abu k
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-06 23:54:47	I'm currently tweeting atop Mount Natalie's Ass
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-06 23:59:16	I just can't with myself anymore
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-01 22:38:38	Watching Transformers and realizing one of them is named Ratchet
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-07 14:52:04	I should probably eat breakfast right now
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-02 01:32:34	I just don't think I'm mentally prepared to watch Teen Wolf tonight
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-02 03:31:51	I don't think I've watched as many action movies in one day as I did today
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-08 12:56:27	I'm not super pissed about being up this early but I would rather be asleep
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-02 14:04:01	My phone went from 20 percent to 4 in like 10 minutes
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-08 20:03:01	Vanilla Wafers and Nutella together are the bee's knees
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-08 20:28:23	I need to go to the beach soon. I can't wait until august
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-09 01:58:09	I'm so ready for Teen Wolf tonight
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-09 03:08:43	I ship Derek and the teacher so hard it's unreal
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-09 17:09:38	This is me
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-09 17:45:43	These sweatpants are literally the best
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-10 13:15:26	Twitter is so dead at this hour of the morning
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-11 15:05:48	Musclebob Buffpants
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-10 17:05:30	My sister started a group message with all her friends to see if they would like her with contacts #kidsthesedays
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-10 18:20:21	Twitter needs to stop telling me to Release to Refresh because it clearly isn't working
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-10 18:28:56	Why aren't I at Canobie right now? Cause Lohanthony is and I new to please him with my greatness
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-10 19:13:54	Sometimes I want to chop all of my hair off just for something different, but then I remember how much I would regret that
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-11 15:56:37	Birthday lunch for Jeffrey!
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-11 17:03:33	The fact that I am actually playing hide and seal right now
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-11 17:06:18	Mall with the Applebee clan
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-12 01:50:02	Hmmm I wonder where my phone is...
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-12 01:50:49	Amanda Bynes just gets me, you know? Like we really feel each other
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-12 01:53:53	Kingsley hasn't posted his video yet so I'm getting a little worried
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-12 01:54:45	I better not have any plans when Teen Beach Movie comes out cause I'm definitely not missing that
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-12 02:00:23	Keeping Up With the Kardashains = lyfe
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-13 03:26:30	Watching 17 Again with Abu
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-13 21:56:28	I watch wayyy to many movies with Abu
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-13 23:51:08	I love buying stuff
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-15 22:45:14	Finally re-doing my room again
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-16 01:17:15	For some reason I haven't touched Twitter in a really long time #whatishappenningtome
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-16 01:19:48	Even twitter isn't cheering me up right now, which is weird cause it usually works
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-15 02:15:44	I am voluntarily watching My Little Pony
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-16 21:15:32	So fucking hungry
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-17 16:01:25	The day after Abi gets her contacts she gets braces on üòÇ

451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-17 16:41:40	The sad thing is I will probably end up seeing the One Direction movie even though I don't really like them
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-17 17:04:21	Tyler Posey be the baby daddy to my children
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-17 17:10:31	The new Jonas Brothers music video gives me so many feels
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-17 17:12:34	I have such a deep passion for the Jonas Brothers and Amanda Bynes I just can't even
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-17 17:16:20	Since when the fuck is Mumford &amp; Sons considered rock music?
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-17 17:18:32	I don't know man, these VMA nominations kinda suck major ass
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-17 17:52:47	Today is just one those days where I tweet to much

451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-19 17:08:06	The high school isn't as scary as I thought it would be in the summer time
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-19 17:12:30	T minus 6 hours and 48 minutes until TEEN BEACH MOVIE
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-21 20:30:48	Mom won't let me and Boo churn the ice cream we are trying to make
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-18 20:05:09	I feel like saying R.I.P when someone passes away is so disprespectful
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-18 20:12:03	I just can't even with my profile pic anymore
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-18 20:44:45	Just filled in Ma's brows
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-18 20:47:03	Maybe I should plug in my lap top since it is less than a foot away but that requires getting up and we all know how I feel about that
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-19 21:55:38	I'm thinking I might have to go to Boston some time this weekend so I can stalk Justin Bieber
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-19 22:18:42	I want to go to Boston Calling so bad!

451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-23 01:40:50	I don't know how I feel about dancing from 9-4 tomorrow....
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-23 22:04:25	I got kicked in the face today, it was quite riveting
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-23 22:20:34	"I will not be upstaged by some slut with mutant lungs!"
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-23 02:19:39	Gerard is the creepiest character on Teen Wolf
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-23 02:48:27	So that's how Deucalian became blind
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-23 02:50:14	@MeganCafarella Don't forget they were sparkling like fireworks
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-23 02:50:38	Elysium looks like a sick movie
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-23 02:53:46	Derek's ex-girlfriend looks like one of those creepy girls from all the scary movies
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-23 03:00:02	So that's why a werewolf's eyes turn blue
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-23 03:02:11	I just have this strange feeling that Derek tries to kill himself before this season ends
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-23 23:14:39	I'm done with life. Amanda Bynes is in a psychiatric hospital.
451858424	LSchmally	2013-07-24 03:07:48	My legs feel like they just gave birth
