45216314	baeyle	2013-02-04 22:20:38	Why did I think it was okay to eat two bowls of ice cream before work? I blame @BndItLikeBequet because he left it at my house.

45216314	baeyle	2013-02-19 16:56:15	Its the most annoying thing when you have to wait for your friends to get out of academic support so you dont have to eat by yourself.
45216314	baeyle	2013-02-21 16:51:44	I want to go sledding, but theres no way Ill make it out my driveway.

45216314	baeyle	2014-06-20 17:26:39	why do I always get the people that have no idea what they're doing
45216314	baeyle	2014-06-20 19:48:39	I get to have my hair redone for free I'm happy now
45216314	baeyle	2014-06-20 17:26:18	I asked for a reverse ombré and the girl literally just split my hair in half and dyed the bottom half
45216314	baeyle	2014-06-22 20:59:36	keyshas "I'm almost there" is actually "I'm about to leave my house"
45216314	baeyle	2014-06-24 03:24:01	Thelma &amp; Louise is on netflix and I'm probably the happiest person ever
45216314	baeyle	2014-06-27 00:14:34	@AlexBurk2 I just had to do that I'm considering switching to grocery now
45216314	baeyle	2014-06-27 00:15:46	I had to push carts because there isn't a courtesy clerk here I definitely underestimated how difficult it is
45216314	baeyle	2014-06-25 14:32:05	I hope my hair doesn't fall out since I've dyed it twice in a week
45216314	baeyle	2014-06-25 17:38:07	Only 6 months until Christmas!!
45216314	baeyle	2014-06-29 15:25:55	I've been in wine and spirits for an hour and had 4 customers
45216314	baeyle	2014-06-29 03:05:38	@LoveKeKeB I said I don't like it AS MUCH
45216314	baeyle	2014-07-03 02:06:13	why can't the weather be like this forever
45216314	baeyle	2014-07-03 03:35:36	I'm watching the last episode of bones that's on netflix idk what I'm supposed to do with the rest of my summer now

45216314	baeyle	2014-07-10 20:23:25	I really don't want to go to work today
45216314	baeyle	2014-07-13 14:13:36	I don't understand why we need someone in wine and spirits at 9am on a Sunday I'm just gonna stand here and do nothing for hours

45216314	baeyle	2014-07-25 04:08:26	if me and keysha aren't married by the time we're 40 we're marrying each other
45216314	baeyle	2014-07-29 15:13:51	We're allowed to bring books and read if we're in wine and spirits so that definitely makes the time go by faster
45216314	baeyle	2014-07-30 13:46:55	I woke up at 6:37 when I had to be at work at 7 it has been a stressful day so far
