452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-02 11:43:18	@MikeAndMike stupid stupid stupid stupid jets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-02 15:38:42	@producermike975 he's a joke. I loved him two fold for being a buck and jet now not so much
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-02 21:41:25	@nyjets no keep it on the Sanchise. He's tough and a winner
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-02 23:13:03	@markschlereth its Tom Cruise what did you expect
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-03 01:28:10	@stephenasmith sanchez will be fine. Look up your boy Eli's numbers in year 3 and talk to me then
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-03 13:28:21	@MikeAndMike winning
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-13 20:11:28	@nickmangold happy bday Nick
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-03 20:21:34	@IntentionalTalk R.A. Dickey. He seems like the kind of guy who can catch a bunch and tell a story
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-13 23:04:04	Gotta love long lines at walmart
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-04 23:37:20	@nfl32 the jets issue is not coach or qb. Its team unity
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-05 12:04:35	@markschlereth that's because if they got in he was gonna lose again
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-15 18:46:19	@damienwoody I personally root for the Gmen. I hate Brady.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-11 15:45:34	@damienwoody I agree. Haley would be good but a better running attack first. He's best on play action
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-11 17:22:35	@nickmangold well put Nick. Go Gang Green and Bucks
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-11 17:26:10	@Mark_Sanchez you're the man. Can't wait to see you holding the Lombardi trophy.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-11 20:26:52	@SportsCenter those players were the same ones saying he could lead them to a SuperBowl when they did their part and they were winning
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-12 00:35:39	@damienwoody they should man up and put their name on it too.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-12 02:44:23	Storage wars with my wife
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-12 13:19:50	@markschlereth the show should be Mike Mike and Stink
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-06 23:48:20	@KingJames Go Cavs
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-07 03:44:19	@damienwoody we missed you this year. GO Jets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-12 13:53:04	@MikeAndMike Sanchez should be the QB. Get him the running attack he used to have and he'll be just fine
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-12 15:18:10	@damienwoody morning
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-08 21:07:22	@kirkmorrison somebody tell @stephenasmith. That and see what he says
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-20 03:03:22	@mishacollins what up Cas
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-27 19:17:53	@IntentionalTalk mike piazza and tom seaver
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-18 21:57:46	@markschlereth they both want love to keep us together
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-19 11:33:58	@MikeAndMike Greeny always over thinks, but in this case he may be right
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-19 11:39:11	@RealMichaelKay I may be a Mets fan but I love the way you call a game.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-19 23:19:09	@Pouha91 he's the best. Love watching you dominate big man
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-29 13:26:57	@KingJames cute pic and Go Cavs
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-21 13:25:11	@Mets can't wait till pitchers and catchers. The official beginning o
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-01-31 12:46:36	@stephenasmith it may be complicated but they've been running it for 12 years. Throw him the ball
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-04 19:40:04	@autocorrects unless its not wrong. Then its just funny
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-05 17:25:35	@Patriots obviously something Charlie Weiss designed... Since they haven't changed since he left a decade ago.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-13 01:29:39	@MetsGM have a safe trip. Thanks for giving us hope again.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-13 15:43:48	@damienwoody It depends on what they move up for. If its a pass rusher go up. Offense not so much. I like the DL hire too
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-06 18:21:55	@damienwoody mario williams. We have a Sanchise qb. We need to get younger on D and a pass rusher
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-14 13:04:11	@MikeAndMike you were great till the long note at the end of the verse. Tell greeny to let you handle it.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-07 18:32:22	@damienwoody doin ok. For me as long as it wasn't the patriots I'm good. Can
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-07 18:42:31	@TheSheikh I've won 2 and dwoody is still playin. He's the missing link. Which Madden game?
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-14 23:50:07	@damienwoody could not ask for more by edwin mccain. Mine and my wifes wedding song
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-07 19:05:02	@TheSheikh I have Madden 10 for PS 2. 12 is next. Have roots in C
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-21 20:00:26	@johansantana can't wait to. See you toe the rubber.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-10 20:25:19	@MetsGM were these tires saved from the fire last year or acquired after?
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-22 23:40:23	@Mets #Mets50 Gil Hodges
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-28 12:39:08	@MikeAndMike The Browns need the same thing they've needed since the Tim Couch days. O Line and some weapons. McCoy will be fine.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-25 20:37:05	@damienwoody sorry to hear about that. Thoughts and prayers with you and your family
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-26 03:34:23	@KingJames Go Cavs
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-02-28 23:13:16	@Mets #Mets50 Hojo Straw and David Wright

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-01 22:51:11	@johansantana we miss you Ace. Can't wait to see you on TV up here in frigid NY
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-02 19:20:48	@KingJames Go Cavs
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-02 19:22:52	@M_Weatherly wife saw you on Charmed today.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-02 22:18:59	@damienwoody should be pass rush if Mario Williams is unattainable
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-06 02:20:33	@damienwoody my friends and I from Ohio call it Big Ten East
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-06 16:17:24	@johansantana can't wait to see you today. We have waited for today. Go get em Ace
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-07 18:38:56	@damienwoody I did that to a buddy of mine. I covered the names. He picked the Sanchise. Got mad and left when I showed who was who
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-07 18:49:47	@damienwoody no. Should have let chad play and brought in Sanchez the next year. Chad sat behind Vinny and he was amazing.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-07 19:13:17	@damienwoody He's also the only QB to beat in order Brady Favre and Manning in succession.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-08 23:07:34	@RealMichaelKay Big Jets Fan. Manning is a 36 year old QB with a rebuilt neck. Jets need to stay the course and build around him
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-08 23:08:00	@RealMichaelKay him being Mark Sanchez
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-09 01:55:50	@Mark_Sanchez you're the man Sanchise. Real Jets fans want you under center not some old man with a busted neck. Go get em
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-09 23:31:23	@damienwoody because they live in the same town as Yankee fans and that's how they win. They buy it.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-10 03:43:39	Watching #jerzathon. Wow the drama situation is ridiculous
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-10 13:43:34	@MikeAndMike it is the right thing to do. One half and then one play from the Super Bowl. Build around him. They'll get there
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-11 00:27:42	@damienwoody typical NY fans. Win now and not care about the future. Love that they re signed him
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-12 19:58:04	@M_Weatherly what you didn't like the Mets or something
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-12 00:34:39	@johansantana lookin good Ace.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-12 00:39:54	@ReillyRick funny he accounted for 32 TD's last year and his offense had no identity. God forbid they get an identity
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-12 00:42:11	@Espngreeny can't believe I'm saying this but I agree with you Greeny.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-15 11:10:02	@Espngreeny what no Shaka Smart love greeny?
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-13 14:47:59	@Mark_Sanchez glad to have you in green and white for the foreseeable future.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-13 14:57:11	@Espngreeny but should our Jets throw money at Vincent Jackson
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-18 03:00:09	@Espngreeny no. The NCAA is the biggest joke in sports this side of the BCS.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-18 15:24:19	@Givemethelefty welcome to Twitter. Can't wait till you get back on the bump
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-18 15:25:27	@nickmangold how do you think urban Meyer is gonna do as.bucks head coach
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-18 18:54:18	@FrankCaliendo greeny's Northwestern team is
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-17 01:36:16	@nickmangold blew up one of my brackets but i love it
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-22 17:18:06	@Espngreeny I'm with you greeny it adds competition and a dimension our O line is good at
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-22 17:20:17	@markschlereth I agree. Anytime you add a winner your team gets better
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-22 17:21:45	@TimTebow Welcome to Gang Green.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-23 00:49:17	@stephenasmith why are you such a hater
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-21 00:33:28	@Espngreeny he goes to the jets I'll revoke your fan card
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-23 01:03:13	@redturn2 can't wait till the fifth. Let's go mets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-26 17:40:39	@stephenasmith so is a primetime special to watch a narcissistic hoops player break the heart of a city. Zip it and stop hating
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-25 14:16:12	@Givemethelefty just please don't use the surgically repaired oje. Need ya back lefty
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-30 01:19:53	@FiremanEd42 thank you for saying what I feel was needed by somebody Jet fans listen to
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-03-29 11:46:59	@MikeAndMike #word association bellichick too much credit not given to Romeo and charlie

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-01 11:13:13	@FrankCaliendo that's the only way people turn it on the first time. Their reality show virgins
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-03 21:17:11	@nyjets yeah just like last year. It's the same thing
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-03 21:17:57	@Mets that's why I Like ike
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-04 03:02:28	@redturn2 that is a phenominal film.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-04 16:10:17	@Espngreeny yes because no one is still talking about the collapse. It's all about bobby v
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-02 17:20:48	@damienwoody I say they do it was the best year so far when they did
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-05 20:44:39	@DocGooden16 he was so good thought I was watching you Doc
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-09 13:02:33	@Espngreeny I normally don't do this but I agree with you
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-09 14:48:02	@KBurkhardtSNY the way David Wright has looked at the plate
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-09 16:34:33	@KMillar15  why the Mets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-07 13:58:45	@KBurkhardtSNY you make setting up the scorecard at home a lot easier. Thanks Kevin
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-08 13:59:20	@Givemethelefty happy Easter lefty. Give em hell today
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-08 14:04:09	@ComedyCentral #caddyshack quotes oh don't sell yourself short judge you're a terrible slouch
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-08 17:43:59	@BobOjedaSNY love the insight and still watch tou pitch on film to this day
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-11 15:50:55	@SNYtv the link isn't working for the autograph giveaway
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-13 23:32:53	@SNY_Guilfoyle I don't care what it looked like Jimmy Rollins just made a bush league play
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-14 16:09:01	@Buster_ESPN I'm surprised Davey Johnson of all people are allowing an inning count. He did fine with Gooden
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-14 16:10:52	@Espngreeny no not crazy.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-18 17:30:06	@BeerMoneyonSNY David cone
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-19 12:27:08	@Espngreeny they shouldn't be allowed to block at all. This is an example of the monster corruption that is the ncaa
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-16 10:42:18	@espngreeny I didn't see the Larry don't tweet. Having lived in Cleveland every Jackie Robinson day I think of Larry
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-16 15:01:08	@Espngreeny the players who were there last year have no out. Bobby is a fire starter not a hand holder. Play better. There's the answer
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-16 15:03:33	@damienwoody was that pic taken in cortland
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-20 10:03:27	@espngreeny if you spend a lot of time on granderson please spend the same amount on a little leaguer that's the size of the stadium
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-21 00:54:38	@Buster_ESPN bet ya fifth bucks I get us a rainout
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-21 01:23:48	@Givemethelefty there's a guy behind the Met dugout dressed like Hulk Hogan.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-17 11:28:27	@Espngreeny as you see I also suffer with the jets. 7 years in Ohio didn't change the Mets or jets. That's suffering
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-24 21:48:46	@KBurkhardtSNY would they bring Harvey up from buffalo
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-24 21:56:00	@KBurkhardtSNY sorry kev didn't see sandy said no to Harvey
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-29 13:09:25	@Mets happy birthday glider
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-30 17:14:24	@jukecitysports Midwest stuff lol.

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-30 19:08:31	@BeerMoneyonSNY Blair Thomas
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-04-25 20:56:39	@Espngreeny so you not like
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-02 01:05:16	@KBurkhardtSNY can I get a mention of the picture of Keith and Mr Snuffalupagus that was on Facebook today.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-02 01:59:20	@KBurkhardtSNY tell Keith I would definitely follow him
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-02 11:00:03	@Espngreeny from another jet fan who also roots against them I still find it funny they haven't won without Charlie and Romeo
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-02 11:00:53	@DUSTINKELLER81 can't ensure for the season. J E T S jets jets jets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-02 11:02:36	@DUSTINKELLER81 that's supposed to be wait
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-02 11:35:37	@MikeAndMike if you think loomis was tainted then the pats are definitely.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-08 21:53:57	@jukecitysports watch the Mets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-08 11:10:47	@MikeAndMike Hamels is a joke. He's mediocre and gets carried by a good team.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-11 19:55:15	@KBurkhardtSNY wow Citifield south. That place is huge
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-10 10:41:25	@redturn2 way to sweep the Philadelphia red. Makes us enjoy the day off a whole lot more
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-10 10:43:07	@MikeAndMike @espngreeny I'm agreeing with Golic. I'm so tired of the bounties I channel surf when they come up
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-10 11:29:27	@MikeAndMike no lebron doesn't choke until conference or NBA finals
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-23 11:34:22	@Espngreeny of course windhorst thinks it was intentional. You don't take sides against the family
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-25 14:55:58	@KBurkhardtSNY why no Matt Harvey
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-20 17:45:48	@fluffyguy love your stuff man. From one fluffy guy to another
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-20 23:40:58	@jumblejim not happy the burned the flask. Idjits
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-23 21:02:24	@redturn2 love how clutch you boys have been with 2 outs. You guys are phenominal to watch man. Keep it goin
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-06-02 02:40:06	@johansantana I was there when you carried us in 08 against Fla. You have made my year. Thank you
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-06-03 23:16:38	@RealMichaelKay why never a personality that had to do with the Mets on centerstage
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-06-03 23:18:42	@KBurkhardtSNY why no Matt Harvey
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-06-08 17:16:46	@IntentionalTalk subway series. When they made this interleague play a reality this is the series they had in mind. Let's Go Mets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-06-10 01:04:07	@AdamSchein that's a die hard love it Let's Go Mets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-05-31 17:58:30	@LoudMouths yes he should get a new deal. He's the best in the game
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-06-06 02:00:00	@KBurkhardtSNY I have faith in bobby parnell
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-06-14 19:08:51	@RealMichaelKay heard you Arod Gehrig debate yesterday. If it was Manny who broke record and did ped would you defend as strongly
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-06-17 18:30:46	@KBurkhardtSNY tell the booth the guy Seaver struck out with the change up on 3-2 was Willie McCovey
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-06-21 02:09:45	@1staz8 he looks like him too
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-06-26 22:15:05	@LoudMouths if Reyes was too much then he certainly is, but no one kills him because he's a Yankee. That's a joke
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-06-21 10:52:09	@Espngreeny how about bellichick post Romeo amd Charlie
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-06-21 11:38:17	@MikeAndMike bellichick post Romeo and Charlie
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-06-22 12:41:21	@Espngreeny good for him. It's not the player people have issues with. It's the narcissist
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-07-02 14:43:05	@johansantana looked great Saturday ace
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-07-06 03:07:42	@BrendanHeinz you're a Douche dude.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-07-07 00:21:45	@FrankCaliendo I think its funny cryer had bubble vision and ran the radar.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-07-08 15:46:44	@redturn2 what made you shave the goatee
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-07-08 15:47:48	@Buster_ESPN he's a joke.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-07-09 18:18:49	@ChrisCarlinSNY he's LaRussa he doesn't do anything that's right just his way. Dickey the Strasburg following guaranteed a win
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-07-10 18:07:58	@LoudMouths with Gee down are we gonna see Matt Harveyq or is Hefner gonna get the innings along with Batista
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-07-10 02:33:28	@Buster_ESPN Prince Fielder is a monster
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-07-12 21:07:30	@redturn2 we not talkin about the game we talkin bout practice. Nice AI reference
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-07-18 01:13:39	#storagewars This is my favorite Barry episode
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-07-14 18:38:48	@JoeandEvan he's worthless other than hitting a few homers. Don't screw with the chemistry. Get pen help first
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-07-17 14:46:46	@KBurkhardtSNY I agree. If the next three go the way we want they will ride the energy he brings through the Dodgers and so on.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-07-16 17:54:23	@jrauch60 have a good day with the fam big man. Go get the Nats tomorrow night. Let's Go Mets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-07-18 01:12:14	#storagewars Dave could he the biggest Douche in the world.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-07-27 23:07:52	@RealMichaelKay love listening to you on radio. I'm a homer like you. Don't listen to angry fans.  You rock man.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-02 16:52:57	@SportsCenter no not yet. Yes he's been the Super Bowl MVP twice but his D won the first one. He won the award because he was the QB.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-10 12:58:18	@Espngreeny so I get that the trade is a big deal but the leading winner in the NL is a knuckle baller. Where's the love for R.A.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-11 02:14:29	@espnbob is the lack of protection tonight just the first pre season game or is it a bigger issue?
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-11 12:58:14	@espnbob are you doing any Ohio State games for College Football this year.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-11 17:28:34	@espnbob that's cool. I'd rather listen to you and Marty then watch on TV. Thank god for the ESPN radio app.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-12 14:53:06	@RothenbergESPN you say don't panic over 1 week of pre season and yet you seem to be in a panic.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-13 16:40:27	@espnbob @michaelbertie @The_Xman wouldn't it be most interesting redneck in the world
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-15 10:37:43	@Espngreeny players are a joke and ownership is spineless. Bobby is too hard nosed for the entire organization
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-14 18:08:00	@FrankCaliendo if you like Grimm try Supernatural
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-16 14:55:06	@ReillyRick love the column. I agree to a point. They are still a huge name because of the history, and I'm a Buckeye fan. No love for ND
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-17 00:14:40	Can't wait http://t.co/DK63LCNL
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-17 00:31:14	@espnbob I find it funny that al these "experts" don't realize Sanchez is  better than both Mannings and a few others to this point.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-27 02:23:47	@espnbob did the offensive line answer your questions/concerns with their performance tonight?
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-19 13:25:17	@Ian_OConnor Rex shouldn't be on the hook for the roster. Coaches coach the players they are given. This is on Tannenbaum
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-27 15:06:46	@FiremanEd42 I'm with you fireman Ed. They will get the job done Go Jets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-27 15:12:26	@AdamSchein @FisolaNYDN yeah he just has more playoff wins than Namath.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-19 01:10:22	@espnbob the jets will have more success tonight with Tebow because they don't blitz him. They want him to throw. I'm a Sanchez guy
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-19 20:03:25	@joshlewinstuff weekend at bernies 2
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-26 17:47:56	@espnbob I'm personally more worried about the O line. If they don't score more taunt field goals so be it. Protect the QB
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-28 14:29:38	@mikeypro78 what do ypu expect from those two man
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-31 00:31:22	@espnbob is it tougher to prepare for a team that was vanilla on offense in the pre season or one that showed how explosive they were
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-29 13:26:30	@Buster_ESPN why no love for Dickey. 16 wins low ERA and great strike out total.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-08-31 16:28:02	@Wheelerpro45 now the only reason I like you is because of the Mets. GO BUCKEYES
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-01 23:18:08	@adnanESPN so the coach is supposed to say they are trash? The only one who believes is him.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-02 10:46:49	@gehrig38 sad part is members of the media in Boston or NY would never take that for an answer and you know it.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-02 10:50:15	@dailystache does that mean HoJo is Darth Vader or is it Reyes since he left for the darkside
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-02 15:32:57	@Espngreeny not until they both win their conference so there's no joke of a title game last year
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-09 18:22:34	@espnbob I'm loving today so far, but the question is who are these guys and what happened to the Jets?
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-09 20:23:43	@Espngreeny you were right the Jets O is absolutely terrible. Keep hatin we need all the extra momentum we need
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-09 23:17:27	@FrankCaliendo @Espngreeny he also said Tebow should start and the Jets were horrible. Let him keep talking
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-10 10:54:58	@Espngreeny please keep talking. KOD reverse
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-03 15:33:01	@Wheelerpro45 you should be headed to St. Louis
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-05 13:55:08	@KMillar15 disown them. Let's Go Mets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-04 15:58:44	@DickieV Dickey. Just all year he's been the best
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-13 10:58:55	@Espngreeny the way you talked about Eli I hope you have the same faith for Sanchez who came in and won right away.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-14 12:53:10	@mishacollins don't forget the angel that found a liquor store and drank it. Wishes for you too
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-14 13:03:16	@Espngreeny please please please pick the Steelers in Sunday
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-06 11:06:20	@Espngreeny ravens confirmed Modelled passed away at 4am
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-06 11:43:28	@Espngreeny @MikeAndMike there's an 18 game winner in  MLB. How about 30 seconds for that guys.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-08 14:34:36	@Collin_McHugh do you watch college football?
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-15 14:59:17	@Espngreeny which means now that you've said that they both lose
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-15 21:48:49	@damienwoody how bout them Buckeyes Wood
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-15 22:11:42	@damienwoody yeah I saw that. Sometimes better to be lucky than good though right
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-16 21:58:07	@espnbob why isn't the game on the ESPN radlio app. We don't get 98.7 upstate
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-16 22:16:45	@espnbob kinda mad I can't listen on the app. You and Marty call a great game
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-16 22:26:30	@RealJoeNamath good call Broadway Joe
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-17 16:19:36	@damienwoody need to do a few things. Actually get Ben on the ground and catch balls that hit WR in hands.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-19 00:53:16	@Wheelerpro45 have you ever been in that big of a pickle before?
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-24 11:17:13	@MikeAndMike Jets are in first place #mmfivewords
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-27 13:47:55	@FrankCaliendo no but apparently Greenberg wants his arms.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-27 14:07:19	@RADickey43 good luck today. You are an inspiration and my family is pulling for you to win #20.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-30 20:14:12	@damienwoodyis this just one of rose got their butts handed to them or real big issues
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-25 10:21:10	@Espngreeny the tuck game. The raiders would say that was the most brutal call
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-09-23 22:50:57	@espnbob so I'm listening to Don and Greg and I'm sick of Jet fans who don't take a W for a W.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-06 16:45:44	@OGTedBerg unlike classless Arod during game 3 of the world series. They sign them don't rain on my parade
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-06 22:25:51	@FrankCaliendo yeah it might have been but the jingle wasn't nearly as catchy
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-07 01:25:31	@SGSR_OSU just sent you an email but love the broadcast. Mike Martinez Kingston NY via S. Euclid OH
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-12 17:45:40	@adnanESPN so the highest paid player in the game is benched in the playoffs. Yankee fans think the Mets have problems. Wow
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-11 22:10:19	@AdamSchein the question should be does he trust them. They have to lead the league in drips and he's pressing.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-14 14:44:49	@espnbob you and Marty are why I don't watch the Jets on TV.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-13 23:52:51	@espnbob its funny everybody is panicking at 2-3. They have a very tough schedule, no play makers and QB under more pressure than anyone
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-17 12:18:12	@BoomerandCarton keep dreaming. They're not the 2004 Red Sox. Not nearly as much heart without Jeter.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-09 00:41:08	@FrankCaliendo are ypu trying to make Greenberg happy
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-22 10:49:01	@Espngreeny then they'll be just who we thought they were. A team who has done the same thing for years figured out
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-24 13:51:28	@Espngreeny @lindacohn @NDmom @StacyGSG thought everyday was pick on greeny day
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-27 21:57:47	@SGSR_OSU where else can I listen. The upstream app has the women's hockey game on
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-27 23:53:37	@SGSR_OSU live tweets are great. Not your fault. Gonna try and catch some of the hockey game too
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-28 00:38:22	@SGSR_OSU how has the D been today. Saw the pick six but nothing else
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-21 13:13:07	@Ian_OConnor can the NY media stop scapegoating A fraud and blast the other 5 guys who couldn't hit. Or give Det some credit
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-21 20:26:26	@espnbob happy bday to Marty's son
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-21 23:57:37	@Espngreeny gee for a bad loss they showed me a lot today. Most importantly Sanchez showed me a lot
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-29 12:52:18	@RADickey43 happy birthday Ace. Hopefully the next thing next to your name besides great man will be Cy Hound award winner
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-10-31 14:42:12	@KBurkhardtSNY my dad is a huge Mets fan and lives in Cleveland. Safe trip Kevin
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-11-16 19:39:19	@joshlewinstuff his nickname should be roller coaster in honor of Cedar Point
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-11-20 21:36:13	@DanneelHarris loved you in one tree hill
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-12-11 12:06:31	@jrauch60 doing your Clark Griswold impression I see
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-12-13 16:05:33	@MHealeySportsno its people thinking you need a homerun hitter at every position. He's garbage. I'm a diehard Met fan.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-12-12 11:35:46	@MikeAndMike happy birthday Golic. You are a lucky man as you share this birthday with my son Zack
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-12-12 11:38:56	@backstop40 I eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast. You eat pieces of shit for breakfast..... No
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-12-10 16:20:07	@backstop40 @SMartinez826 I signed up hammered after Jets blew last season lol
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-12-19 00:03:15	@dailystache that's phenomenal
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-12-20 21:09:11	@SNY_Studio  who cares
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-12-21 12:14:02	@Espngreeny I root against New England and anybody that went to Michigan. Especially Brady
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2012-12-23 13:44:39	@backstop40 please tell me you didn't get into a fight
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-01-09 19:33:49	@Espngreeny this is a joke. Writers shouldn't be allowed to vote. No offense to buster or Timmy
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-01-09 20:42:33	@backstop40 your uncle and I are pissed
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-01-14 19:25:33	@IntentionalTalk game 7 2006 NLCS. Mets fans have yet to get over that one
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-01-22 03:21:45	@RADickey43 we will miss you in NY this year. Good luck in Toronto.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-01-24 23:46:52	@Revis24 they trade you and I'm done. I have family in cleveland and I will become a browns fan
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-01-23 16:12:32	@MLBNetwork David Wright #faceofMets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-01-22 16:04:35	@Buster_ESPN toss up between 99 Mets and 2000 Indians
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-01-25 14:29:08	@Espngreeny I have family in Cleveland. If they trade him my T Rich jersey is ordered. Done with Jets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-01-25 21:22:07	@Jay_HorwitzPR we love you Jay
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-02-14 11:26:57	@DickieV sorry but I have to disagree. Michigan/Ohio State is the best.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-02-21 15:10:32	April 1 needs to get here http://t.co/RV8asBVVpE
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-02-21 18:38:59	@gehrig38 until an o coordinator game plans for Sherman he should shut it
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-02-25 16:02:42	@Espngreeny oh boy
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-03-02 13:34:24	@Jay_HorwitzPR do it Jay that would be awesome
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-03-10 17:06:53	@joshlewinstuff you and Eddie are great. Can't wait to hear you and Howie
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-03-29 18:56:31	@metspolice I was there with my dad. His first game at Shea since July of 86.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-04-16 22:46:39	@joshlewinstuff tell Howie a fellow diehard thinks his idea is perfect.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-05-31 23:58:10	@joshlewinstuff well there is little to win and nothing to lose in Miami Josh. Love you and Howie
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-06-16 22:48:53	You know you're at a non dancing wedding when your Ass hurts from the chair. Thank god for SoCo

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-07-07 14:07:56	@MattHarvey33 you should get the nod to start this one too. Thanks for a dominant first half
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-07-06 01:16:31	@JoeandEvan I still call it the Jake.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-07-07 17:33:19	@SMartinez826 I like it
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-07-31 13:24:11	@SMartinez826 I'll get him later.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-01 23:54:46	@kalpenn they gave the dog maxi rod
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-06 11:18:28	@EKShow @StatsNBCSports @eknbc because he admitted once got caught a second time and he's been tampering.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-06 11:19:34	@Espngreeny no. It's how you handle yourself afterwards.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-06 18:30:54	@Espngreeny you and my wife Stephanie @SMartinez826 have the same birthday. can I get a retweet
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-10 13:16:37	@redturn2 way to stroke last night man.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-08 09:14:41	@JoeandEvan I prefer addition of the presidential candidates in season 6.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-08 09:17:24	@AdamSchein Charlie Weiss's system made welker. For that matter it made Brady too
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-08 20:30:40	@SMartinez826 I hope so too.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-12 01:02:06	@ScottRice56 nice biggie reference
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-13 18:25:26	@adnanESPN sad part is he's got a low win total because of their offense. Mets need to pick him up tonight.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-16 15:31:58	@metspolice they have a ton coming off the books. Even if payroll doesn't increase we get one or two good players
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-14 15:20:41	Go Bucks http://t.co/Hzipj9gMUi

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-21 12:44:48	@NickHowrd11 @metspolice who had more homers Marlon Byrd or B.J. Upton
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-21 17:21:32	@NickHowrd11 @metspolice the braves. The question wasn't about record. It was about production
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-22 11:24:41	@espngolic you play to win the game. My all time favorite. Love coach Edwards
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-23 14:10:48	@kevinburkhardt as long as he throws strikes
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-23 11:25:15	@jarpad I thought Jensen was batman. Only batman could throw a pen into a gun
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-08-27 13:03:51	@Tony_Sanchez40 well see where they're registered, candlesticks make a nice gift ok let's get two

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-06 21:39:26	@Jay_HorwitzPR he's an Ohio boy. He rigged it
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-06 21:41:22	@TylerBeLike do they smell like dead ass too
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-03 23:53:57	@joshlewinstuff I think it was Roger McDowell Josh. Just satin
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-04 11:17:22	@Espngreeny not enough characters but the entire mound visit scene in Bull Durham
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-04 11:18:33	@Espngreeny America has moved in like a steamroller but the one constant has been baseball. People will come Ray
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-04 12:02:46	@Espngreeny you should get his brother Bob to play him
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-06 15:49:08	@FrankCaliendo not if you count pick 6's
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-04 14:19:39	@damienwoody its a joke. He has as many weapons as Sanchez which is none. They news to actually build not say they're rebuilding
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-03 14:06:15	@Jay_HorwitzPR I'm from Cleveland and there's lots to do. Rock Hall just one thing.

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-08 16:15:56	@damienwoody good call wood.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-08 18:24:59	@Espngreeny see its not just Sanchez that is the issue
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-08 18:41:40	@RothenbergESPN wow look what happens when other people do their job. #sancheznottheproblem
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-08 19:32:37	@Ian_OConnor no because when he did he was told to slide or run out. Any of you s called media experts say that about geno yet
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-07 15:35:47	@BartScott57 when she's in goal she's more the madbacker of football. Jets fans miss you bro
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-10 22:59:51	@damienwoody wood that dude talkin smack is an asshole. Wish we still had you bro. I like chances just gotta execute. #JETSjetsjetsjets

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-07 20:40:46	@SGSR_OSU is it halftime. Lost feed in Ustream
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-13 11:38:17	@Espngreeny funny their non investment in offense and lack of weapons was never an out at all when Sanchez was QB. 3 picks is 3 picks
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-12 20:24:30	@SMartinez826 are those who know you supposed to be surprised
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-14 19:08:56	@SGSR_OSU haven't been online today. Is Braxton playing

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-17 11:24:14	@MikeAndMike #grudensgroove all along the watchtower. Hendrix and gruden can't go wrong
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-19 23:59:44	@jarpad being an Ohio state fan I may have had to exorcise that demon
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-20 19:26:37	@jeffpearlman the NCAA is the biggest joke in sports
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-18 21:17:56	@AdamSchein you are a genius. Offer Murphy and Gee they eat some salary and bring him home. Move @EYJr to second #speedattopoflineup
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-21 03:04:34	@robinlundberg no he's the greatest juiced player of all time #AFraudisajoke
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-18 23:07:41	@JeffAtFSOhio @JoeandEvan be happy I can still afford to pay your salaries
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-23 00:38:45	@damienwoody not just 3 points. 3 badly thrown passes and a bad set of play calls
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-23 00:40:22	@robinlundberg that might be their stadium mates
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-23 00:42:16	@LaTroyHawkins32 is that @Wheelerpro45 in the bridal gown
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-09-25 21:15:14	@RealMichaelKay I am a die hard mets fan and enjoy your show.... You would have blasted the Mets. You're a homer like Don. It's all good
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-10-01 12:32:34	@espnbob I see my 3 favorites that's all that matters to me. You Howie and Gary

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-10-01 14:10:52	@Jay_HorwitzPR that's because he's the captain
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-10-01 16:53:22	@metspolice for what a hypodermic needle and a bad contract.

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-10-20 01:38:54	@espnbob from your lips to gods ears. Now hopefully we can get gang green a win tomorrow
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-10-22 14:04:03	@espnbob its a joke. They cone down this light on Ohio state and its the bucks not the tide that win a title last year

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-11-23 13:59:26	@espnbob not knocking so much as to not used to seeing top team not in conference this late in season
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-11-23 14:00:37	@espnbob as far as Auburn goes each team gets a bye I dont like that either with the timing
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-11-23 14:05:46	@espnbob too true. Bucks cant control how good or bad other teams are. Cant help but smile though its senior day and 7 days til Michigan
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-11-23 16:38:11	@SGSR_OSU what time tou guys going live

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-11-30 15:02:58	@damienwoody I heard the same forecast for Ann Arbor too. This one courtesy of the Bucks
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-12-01 01:38:36	@damienwoody whats auburns record and dont say their schedule is tougher you beat whoa in frront of you bucks have done it 24 in a row

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-12-01 01:46:15	@damienwoody rivalry games in my opinion are a bad test for this question. They would have a month to prep. 02 was gonna be a blowout too
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-12-01 13:22:58	@DickieV with all due respect if they get in and bucks are 13-0 it will prove bcs is a massive joke and biased toward SEC
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-12-01 18:58:32	My god the jets secondary is terrible
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2013-12-04 12:36:09	@kevinburkhardt Cano isn't the answer. Sign Granderson and go make a big trade that doesn't kill the farm system for a shortstop

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-10 19:42:50	@jeffpearlman I'm a big mets fan. Those guys from 86 were mostly jerks. Those who were old enough to notice did. Loved them anyway
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-13 16:22:26	@MattHarvey33 can't wait till you get back and beat the Yankees some more man. #LGM

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-14 18:54:43	@SMartinez826 was I in it
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-13 23:57:42	@RealMichaelKay would he have been right if he said Appolonia
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-16 11:19:11	@robinlundberg team Peyton. One guy has run the same system for 14 years and the other is the system.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-19 10:47:40	@MattHarvey33 naps are wonderful before football games Ace.  Hope the arm feels good. Good luck with rehab #LGM

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-15 19:02:29	@MLBNetwork David Wright #FaceofMets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-16 18:07:23	@Espngreeny what do you think of Rex getting an extension
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-20 00:24:00	@redturn2 don't forget deion and Bo and Brian jordan
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-20 15:31:23	@robinlundberg I still think when healthy Revis is better. They game plan for Revis. Sherman is a jackass. Hold R.Wayne to 1 for 2 and talk
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-21 16:38:13	@SMartinez826 thanks baby
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-22 19:30:49	@Tony_Sanchez_Jr does it work on your head. Got some bald issues lol
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-22 22:36:22	@SMartinez826 was it a sticky thing from your socks
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-23 12:35:22	@jeffpearlman even he's too good for them... and I have family in Cleveland
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-26 02:43:24	@DonTinnie so you take the drunkenness to twitter huh
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-26 02:46:50	@DonTinnie nice. I'm still plain. Sam Yuengling and Christmas Ale from Cleveland
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-25 17:39:27	@Espngreeny the Jets getting rid of Sanchez after dismantling his offense around him and scapegoating his play to placate fans
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-27 00:11:01	@TylerBeLike don't want to go to work tomorrow either
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-01-27 00:18:32	@TylerBeLike oh yeah
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-01 23:09:07	@mikepiazza31 you going to the world cup
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-04 11:18:08	@Buster_ESPN why not start with Young at 2b and Murphy at 1b. That is the best offensive lineup and not too bad defensively
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-03 16:25:20	@StatsNBCSports because it goes to the QB unless there's an amazing play by someone else. Please see Super Bowl 3
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-03 22:00:25	@RealMichaelKay no one is better than Peyton he is the O and did all this with his neck basically shot.  SB wins are great but he wins
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-05 12:30:29	@espngolic not Ritchie Valens but James Brown or Jackie Wilson
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-08 16:18:02	@robinlundberg are we trying to envoke an evil spirit
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-10 18:18:12	@jeffpearlman probably makes him a better defender too
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-10 01:30:09	@wwwbigbaldhead who is a bigger badass Murphy McManus or Daryl Dixon #AskNorman
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-10 01:45:26	@wwwbigbaldhead if you answer my last tweet I'll feel like that kid that found the golden ticket in that chocolate factory #AskNorman
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-12 17:59:56	@damienwoody you have family in Cleveland wood?
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-12 18:46:36	@damienwoody my parents are on the east side.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-11 16:01:40	@michaelgbaron do you think Collins goes with EYjr at 2b Murph at 1b and Lagares Young and Grandy in OF
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-13 11:04:13	@BobTheMongo out ballpark is not conducive. We need a team much like the 85 ' s Cardinals. Speed high average and a bopper in the middle
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-13 11:07:38	@jeffpearlman is that Rey Ordonez in that picture
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-13 17:49:48	@BobTheMongo you're clinically insane. The last 5 champions out pitched the other team. Lived in Cleveland in 95 your idea didn't win title
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-13 17:53:21	@Galletti12 @Tony_Sanchez_Jr oh boy baseball season is gonna be fun on here
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-13 21:39:45	@BobTheMongo it's not about how much they make its about having a lot of it and the right kinds. See the Giants 2 titles in 3 years.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-13 21:43:50	@Mike_Vorkunov could you guys have asked him more times and more ways if they should have spent more
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-13 03:31:12	@BobTheMongo @AmazinAvenue what kind of drugs are you on Bob. We lived through Kingman once. That's what he is.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-13 03:33:06	@MetsPics not just any ump. That's the voice of god
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-14 19:19:43	@TylerBeLike you around kid
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-15 16:11:34	@jeffpearlman watching 50 greatest mets saw your comment on hot foot. Who was your favorite player on that 86 team
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-15 17:04:35	@jeffpearlman my favorite Mitchell moment was the fight in Cincinnati
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-17 02:12:52	@TylerBeLike yo I gotta work tomorrow. Heading to bed. I should be home by 6 tomorrow. Hit me up
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-18 19:14:03	@SMartinez826 stop bragging. Some of us are cold
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-19 11:18:40	@metspolice are you high
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-19 11:39:31	@Espngreeny it may be associated with the US but there are three statues of liberty.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-19 15:40:32	@TylerBeLike what happened man
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-16 23:36:06	@TylerBeLike yo foods on the way when you coming
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-16 23:44:53	@TylerBeLike sweet

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-17 23:06:39	@TylerBeLike be home in 10
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-18 12:39:07	@espngolic I think greeny belongs on the Mt Rushmore of clowns
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-18 12:56:07	@AdamRubinESPN he homered off him. I was happier to see that
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-18 13:28:30	@Espngreeny  bond: lazenby connery Moore Dalton Brosnan Craig.  Batman:West Keaton Kilmer Clooney Affleck
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-19 18:52:10	@TylerBeLike that sucks man
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-14 22:34:06	@TylerBeLike  steph is going out of town tonight you wanna hang out this weekend.

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-14 23:02:22	@TylerBeLike text me tomorrow
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-22 12:45:34	@AdamRubinESPN don't want him. Don't want Tejada either but really don't want drew
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-24 22:26:08	@RealMichaelKay young better defender. That's what the mets need
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-24 22:33:30	@AdamSchein @SNYtv no he's a product of the juice. Young has speed element and can play D.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-24 22:35:32	@Mets gee can't tell Tuefel was there in 86
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-25 11:09:26	@Landesman78 hey Seth. Hope the south is warmer than upstate NY
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-25 12:31:12	@AdamRubinESPN my first two games in 85 and 86 he started against the cubs
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-25 12:53:35	@Landesman78 stop bragging
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-02-28 19:15:19	@TaigBeLike what time you done with school

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-02 16:42:16	@TaigBeLike that would be huge

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-03 15:13:00	@michaelgbaron why not the bullpen
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-03 17:14:11	@mikepiazza31 good to see you in camp again. Have fun this week.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-03 18:10:32	@TaigBeLike yo you need to download the at bat app.  Got the game on my phone right now cuz
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-03 19:34:23	@matthewcerrone that's what I'm listening on too
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-03 22:02:25	@BobTheMongo @metsonmymind you're high again
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-04 00:24:10	@BobTheMongo then tell me what brand of glue you're sniffing to think that trade makes sense
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-09 10:43:17	@TaigBeLike yo that's not good cuz
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-09 10:46:36	@BobTheMongo dude you need to stop
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-09 11:57:47	@BobTheMongo you're giving me a headache.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-09 11:59:02	@TaigBeLike leave a trail of bread crumbs
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-09 17:30:22	@BobTheMongo so instead of having deep pitching and good hitters you want all home run hitters
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-09 17:30:47	@BobTheMongo I lived in Cleveland in 95 that doesn't work
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-09 17:32:12	@BobTheMongo the orioles won't get out of the east because their rotation is shit
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-10 00:45:21	@Givemethelefty wish you were still in NY lefty. We miss you
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-10 16:35:14	@metsonmymind @michaelgbaron I like Mejia in the pen. Let Lannan pitch out of the 5 or bring Thor up now
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-10 18:11:30	@AdamRubinESPN he just did it again.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-13 02:24:31	@Max_Marcilla last time I checked they beat Brady and the Pats once and by all rights should have both times
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-13 02:26:48	@damienwoody wood. Elway just gave Peyton a top 10 D. I like his chances much better
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-11 13:43:01	@espnbob I can see Rex at his house first thing after free agency opens and he's cut
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-14 17:59:08	@Jay_HorwitzPR is it because he saw your pocket
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-14 20:52:24	@espnbob because NY fans are extremely impatient
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-14 21:15:29	@TaigBeLike yo you around
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-14 00:08:41	@lindacohn love the podcast Linda. Thanks for supporting Ralph #LGM

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-12 10:18:47	@damienwoody nah. I have faith in Rex
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-12 12:08:40	@damienwoody treated me good. #BringRevisBack
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-12 12:14:48	@The7Line it's the only one not associated with a base
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-12 23:16:13	@espnbob I think he wants to come home Bob. I would love to hear that Rex got on a plane at 430 just after he was let go
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-12 23:19:19	@damienwoody the only airport pic I want to see about Revis is Rex at one wherever Darrell is #BringBackRevis
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-12 23:19:52	@espnbob do any of these people get its day 2
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-16 12:53:18	@espnbob that's why you're our guy Bob
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-16 12:53:58	@espnbob @CTGabe @RLop26 he inherited a great coach
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-16 12:56:11	@espnbob hate that
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-16 15:24:47	@NYMetsLife should be a done deal. Move Murphy to first EY to second and play CY Juan and Grandy in OF
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-15 15:54:42	@MMandelkern_BR why not use Doc
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-15 18:36:14	@MMandelkern_BR don't need reminding. Although I like the reference
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-17 19:29:07	@Weerd_Science long time no see man

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-18 00:12:25	@Weerd_Science hope all is well man
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-18 00:14:00	@Weerd_Science hear that. Gonna be a fun year man
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-18 14:00:41	@AdamRubinESPN why not start him there and EY at 2  that gives us a defensive outfield that will be second to none. Not much down on inf
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-18 17:38:31	@TaigBeLike @YoungAdolf_ bitches are evil
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-19 23:13:45	@damienwoody sorry man I'm a Sanchez guy. Vick is injured too much and could be a Tebow like distraction
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-21 23:47:27	@damienwoody Wood how can this not be a bad thing for a young QB to have behind him
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-21 00:03:14	@robinlundberg was LeBron ' s mom there too
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-21 23:36:28	@espnbob hey bob he was never appreciated for anything.  I'm gonna miss him
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-22 00:31:04	@michaelgbaron yeah bad angle. There was half a cup. Then they signed Vick.  Gonna need liquor instead of coffee
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-21 23:35:16	@damienwoody I don't like it. This is Tebow part 2 waiting to happen
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-21 23:38:02	@JetNation I may need to have my sister get me a Browns jersey
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-22 00:02:32	Edited with #aviary &gt; http://t.co/xsQgyVVqFQ http://t.co/Xqxz9jUCfs
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-22 00:14:32	@damienwoody because it's NY  only loyal after they deem it necessary
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-22 19:38:56	@michaelgbaron @nymets945 I don't see why you wouldn't. Tejada off the bench means more flexibility
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-22 19:41:09	@SMartinez826 thought you'd like this http://t.co/x6bsShXSav
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-21 23:34:44	@StatsNBCSports yeah and they killed his offense by subtraction and blamed him. This is wrong
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-21 23:37:17	@AdamSchein think of him doing something Peyton never did. Walking into Foxborough and handing Brady his ass
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-22 12:35:42	@OllieUKEZ I think Vick is a joke and the Jets just screwed themselves
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-24 15:06:45	@Mark_Sanchez you're a class act. This Jets fan is sad to see you go. Hope you land someplace and win a ring. Good luck
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-24 02:01:38	@michaelgbaron @metsjersey let it be Tejada and start Flores
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-23 12:22:21	@michaelgbaron you take great pictures mike.  Makes me feel like I'm there
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-23 12:32:47	@NYJZone @JetNation the issue is the media and other fans will start screaming if Geno has a bad game for Vick to play.  This could be bad
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-24 21:24:47	@StatsNBCSports because Sanchez has never been a health liability like Vick. Torn labrum was one time not every season
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-24 21:29:08	Here's a guy who earned it http://t.co/7iDq74fMPj
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-25 14:20:55	@MikeAndMike I think he looks more like a Clarence than a Darrow
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-26 21:53:39	@michaelgbaron still think murph should be there and EY at second. Gonna hurt in long run. What about Flores at SS
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-26 21:55:05	@MarlinsPark @metspolice love how those are Mets colors on the one
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-27 10:25:22	@MikeAndMike someone please tell Greeny he just quoted ludicrous and not Jay Z.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-30 18:53:28	@EpideMets you're crazy. Nats win East depending on injuries mets and braves fight for second and third marlins 4 phils 5
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-28 23:52:43	@MichelleDBeadle I went to the first one.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-31 13:25:33	@Weerd_Science @AdamRubinESPN rain supposed to stop before first pitch
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-03-31 17:08:49	Gotta love mlb at bat.  Listening to Mets at work for a bit
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-01 12:25:42	@Seth_Everett @Jay_HorwitzPR he'd still be able to hit
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-03 10:29:20	@BobTheMongo dude we don't need 3 guys who may hit 30 but k 200
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-01 23:28:05	@damienwoody depth is good
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-01 12:26:46	@jaysonst were yp uh one of the gu th s killing the mets for not keep him
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-03 14:23:21	@michaelgbaron they can play EY in left and keep Flores up no
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-03 14:27:57	@CY24_7 hang in there man.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-03 14:31:44	@michaelgbaron the DLing of Young won't off set Murph
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-03 16:15:58	@BobTheMongo because today he'll strike out 5 times
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-04 23:55:22	@markmulder20 tell every one in Toronto sincerely concerned Met fan
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-03 18:43:06	@EpideMets what song.  Missed it on radio
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-03 19:12:01	@EpideMets rod stewart
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-02 23:22:44	@BobTheMongo no he doesnt. They play in the east coasts version of Yellowstone.  Defense and pitching. Little bit of power
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-03 22:14:07	@michaelgbaron @Mets @hollywoodjav you're not a true fan bro.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-03 22:15:37	@AdamSchein @SNYtv the u should move murph and EY to play 2. Lagares would be everyday in CF. Best offensive lineup when you put flores ss
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-02 23:41:58	@BobTheMongo and strikeouts lose them. See Monday hit 3 bombs and lost because we k'd 18 times
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-08 23:59:12	@MetsBooth @metshey maj tell Steve he's not alone thinking they Yankees won't go anywhere. No pen No Mo no ring for Jeter
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-09 00:02:19	@MetsBooth nice.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-09 00:03:37	@MetsBooth a What's Happening reference. I know why Howie and @joshlewinstuff laugh so much
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-06 12:19:49	@michaelgbaron @Darylterry74 I th I n Lagares can be better. Gomez wasn't this composed before a full season in.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-10 00:49:18	@dailystache did you do the first question
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-10 00:50:10	@dailystache missed it. When it when is the second
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-10 00:50:36	@dailystache thanks
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-09 10:21:19	@MikeAndMike why isn't the streak of Cal Ripen the most revered #2632
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-09 23:29:48	Am I the only Mets gan that after every inning hears the Let's go Mets F A N da da da in their head
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-10 12:32:45	@MikeAndMike at least he's honest
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-10 13:33:53	@jaysonst @MikeAndMike mike trout and Andrew McCutcheon
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-10 15:16:47	@NickDeBabylon @MMandelkern_BR kinda like Cano right
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-10 15:30:25	@NickDeBabylon @MMandelkern_BR yet if he was hitting .300 and 25+ homers for the yankees he could loaf all he wanted right
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-10 15:31:00	@NickDeBabylon @MMandelkern_BR Reyes is on DL again and I wanted him back
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-11 17:02:25	@michaelgbaron @robertbrender @maggie162 I listen to Howie and @joshlewinstuff on at bat wouldn't know
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-10 20:50:57	@robertbrender what about move Murphy to 1st EY to 2b and when CY is healthy him Lagares and Grandy in OF
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-10 21:25:22	@robertbrender that's sad. I think that makes a lot of sense. Then bring Flores up to play short. Satin you corner back up Tejada middle
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-12 02:39:12	@dailystache #stachetrivia Wright Murphy Duda gee Niese Tejada Davis recker brown
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-15 12:15:01	@Buster_ESPN is anyone going to post Larry Doby's box score as well. I have Cleveland roots. Wanted to ask for a while now
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-16 12:08:19	@michaelgbaron how's Flores doing in Vegas
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-16 12:32:21	@michaelgbaron ok then.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-16 21:26:42	@MetsBooth hey maj tell the guys that all 4 coaches in last year's all star game all had mets ties too just like the trivia question
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-17 10:17:14	@sebroche don't forget Donald O'Connor and possibly the best sidekick in a musical this side of  Buddy Hackett in Music Man
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-17 10:22:34	@MikeAndMike you're excited about what the Jets have done as am I. Would you have been as excited if they built around Sanchez?
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-21 21:22:43	@RealMichaelKay sit Duda move murph to first and EY to 2b. Lagares Young Granderson in outfield
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-26 00:02:38	@BobTheMongo please change teams. I can't take it anymore
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-23 20:53:35	@RealMichaelKay Yankee fans are a joke. The team pilfers everybody they can and then whine when it happens to them. JOKE
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-30 14:28:40	Mets fans: Show you're a true New Yorker, add your name next to Mets legends: #TrueNewYorkers http://t.co/tunSpgNgOM via @Mets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-30 14:31:34	@jeffpearlman here's another one. If it was a minority owner saying those type of things about another race etc. Would outrage be the same
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-30 16:28:31	@greg_prince @metspolice @STLMetsFan5 no because cards fans cheer whether they are good or bad. True mets fans always believe.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-30 18:37:16	@OllieUKEZ he's going 4 to the Browns.  Good in theory though
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-30 09:42:47	@robinlundberg Yankee fans get happy when someone takes the money and runs to them. Spin it around they boo. They're a joke.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-04-30 10:02:41	@JonHeymanCBS you're talking about a classless fan base that revels in out spending everybody.  Then cries when the script gets flipped joke
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-02 12:56:14	@The7Line what's the biggest size you do
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-09 00:52:23	@Landesman78 it's matthews not Evans
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-09 00:57:59	@Landesman78 don't think he'll be there. He's going next unless they take Manziel
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-09 01:04:30	@Landesman78 Browns are taking manziel.  Good luck with that.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-09 01:08:31	@Landesman78 this is insane. Roby and Denard are so much better
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-09 01:09:18	@waynechrebet Roby is better. Loved watching you play for gang green. You were awesome
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-07 00:09:17	@Seth_Everett @joshlewinstuff @MetsBooth reissue. 17 and 31 need to be retired
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-07 00:12:45	@metsonmymind would you move him to first and put EY at second
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-09 10:30:15	@JetNation I'll raise it because we need offense. Slept fine
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-07 10:13:08	@metsonmymind I know the no power part. It does however put a better offensive unit on the field
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-09 20:49:34	@AnthonyDiComo such hostility @AdamRubinESPN
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-11 17:07:05	@MetsBooth maj who writes Josh ' s material. They need a new day job
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-11 17:24:44	@MetsBooth maybe he needs one then
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-11 17:29:36	@michaelgbaron @msimonespn time to move him to 2b and murph to first.  That's the last move to try.  Not like current set up is working
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-10 14:49:49	@Espngreeny Abredaris from Wisconsin is the guy
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-10 21:33:08	@StatsNBCSports @TheBackPage have we ever seen and SEC defensive player of the year go undrafted. They are after all the premier conference
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-10 21:45:07	@kalpenn just wanted you to know I'm doing the Van Wilder double feature tonight. Taj is one of my favorite characters of all time
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-10 21:48:12	@EpideMets stupid people make you want to do that not twitter.  Real Mets fans root till the end of 162 and get behind what we have. #LGM
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-13 00:29:36	@MetsBooth tell Howie worst case scenario it's the kill disco night at Comiskey
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-14 11:36:04	@RyanRuocco I'd take Golic over you. He'd be more fun at the barbecue after he eats meat
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-14 21:09:12	@Andrew_Vig he normally only sees scotch
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-16 00:00:26	@MattEhalt that's awesome
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-16 21:38:49	@damienwoody yes because he was using an estrogen producer to mask the PED
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-15 18:28:47	@metsblog blue collar versus white collar. Simple as that
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-16 11:31:09	@adnanESPN @espngolic saw somebody in a Canadian tuxedo. Immediately thought of you two
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-21 00:10:15	@AdamRubinESPN is it that Fairweather mets fans just don't pay any attention to the team unless they are winning. My god that's 10 Lagares ?
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-21 02:40:31	@michaelgbaron this is the defense I've been asking for only Lagares would be here in center
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-21 22:00:44	@joshlewinstuff seriously Josh you need a writer
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-22 15:39:40	@damienwoody steven a does realize Diller won a super bowl because of his d right.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-24 22:37:40	@mets me and cleon jones http://t.co/MMOiEcCNeP
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-26 20:18:46	@robertbrender he's horrible
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-28 20:39:32	@damienwoody then talk to your boys I n n the media. They ask the questions
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-29 23:46:14	@MetsBooth maj tell the guys I'm sure Zack doesn't like being the butt of their jokes
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-29 23:57:21	@MetsBooth sorry man. I couldn't resist. I listen on at bat and love these 2.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-29 23:58:50	@jeffpearlman you're not right. I wouldn't wish the skins on my worst enemy. Have family in Cleveland
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-30 00:01:46	@MetsBooth tell Howie we are all pulling pulling for the blue shirts
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-05-30 14:55:59	@jeffpearlman try listening to a wanna be sinatra croon smells like teen spirit outside an olive garden
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-06-06 10:31:49	@The7Line @The7LineArmy with you guys in spirit. Bring home a couple W's #LGM
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-06-14 01:45:59	@MetsBooth I think Howie took the wrong turn at Alberquerque
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-06-14 22:42:20	Oh boy now they are quoting Blazing Saddles
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-06-17 01:08:44	@MetsBooth and Maddox never struck him out
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-06-18 21:17:47	@espngolic hey how come the Soccer team song be Born To Run
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-06-20 13:27:50	@MikeAndMike find it funny stink just described Bellichick's offense in Cleveland before Charlie Weiss
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-06-22 18:58:46	@MetsBooth did the guys mention the cup on the bat boy s head. My at bat feed keeps cutting out
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-01 21:19:19	People talking shot about USA soccer http://t.co/UK1Lqd1n2q

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-07 16:53:27	@AdamRubinESPN I have a funny feeling Castro could be my gen. Jim Fregosi. Not that wheeler is Ryan just a feeling
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-08 10:50:01	@MikeAndMike #TheDecision2 #tbt decide should go home no matter what. He wins in Cleveland and he's a sports god not just king James
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-08 16:46:50	@jeffpearlman how about one about the marching bands. OSU Michigan USC MSU etc
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-09 23:13:56	@MetsBooth have a good game guys. Especially you Maj. The puns I'm sure will be flying again tonight
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-11 13:08:13	@MikeAndMike #letter2 so if Gilbert didn't bring him back if he wanted to come back because of the decision would he get killed?
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-11 13:49:14	@OllieUKEZ I do think he needs to get over it . He's angry about the letter well I'm sure there's anger about the decision
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-11 17:21:25	@jeffpearlman make it cherry coke and you have a deal
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-14 21:48:04	@Espngreeny I listened to the pod cast. He went home because he wanted to go home. Team wasn't as big a factor as you said
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-17 13:59:02	@IsringhausenJ you'll always be a Met to us Izzy
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-17 14:00:45	@maggie162 I beat this boredom with the 6 essential games of Shea Stadium
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-21 17:35:40	@AmazinAvenue the diving stop to start a ridiculous DP in Philly on the 9-1 trip in 2006
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-24 11:33:48	@StatsNBCSports college football should ban non conference winning teams from playing for the glass football too
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-25 14:46:49	@Weerd_Science @Mets most people who are true diehards like us Josh pay attention. Those who don't take to social media and ramble
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-31 12:07:29	@michaelgbaron @Justin4383 I'm sorry Tulo is a Coors field product. Mets need to stay the course. I think Kemp is the move this winter
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-31 12:27:21	@michaelgbaron @Justin4383 so he hits 270 and 15 bombs. Sounds like what Flores would do if he got the job. The splits are too big
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-07-31 12:28:56	@michaelgbaron @Justin4383 money is money. The injuries and the non Coors numbers are issue
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-08-07 23:15:24	@CLoprestiWFAN @GreenLanternJet cross him off then
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-08-08 12:09:03	@MikeAndMike #helloherm  don't forget Chad was under center when you beat Brady Favre and Manning 3 games in a row. No one else has done it

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-08-17 00:20:56	@MetsBooth I remember the whole call. They blew a 9 run lead in philly.

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-09-03 02:10:59	@wingoz in my league I took Matty ice in the 5th and Brady in the 9th. Btw 2 QB league
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-09-09 02:28:20	@jeffpearlman what do you think the Jets will do.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-09-09 02:29:35	@michaelgbaron some of us still believe and will continue to believe until the 27th out of game 162.  I know you're one of us too
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-09-10 22:19:55	@Ken_Rosenthal not gonna disagree with Hamilton 50+ steals is amazing.  How close do you think deGrom made it
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-09-11 13:16:57	@SMartinez826 I want one
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-09-16 00:34:56	@MetsBooth tell josh Kerry wood was 98 for the 20 not 2003

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-09-21 00:35:59	@MetsBooth Jones buddy and Hodges behind the plate
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-09-21 00:49:10	@MetsBooth damn. It was a good question Maj
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-09-23 12:15:08	@MikeAndMike not for nothing the guy they ran out of here a few games into his second season had already been to a c I n champ game.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-09-26 01:32:50	@MetsBooth tell josh the name of the song is Seasons of Love
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-09-30 12:23:56	@metspolice I like the pitching match up tonight
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-07 16:48:41	@StatsNBCSports that stuff is the best. Oldest brewery in the country
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-09 18:18:24	@InMetsWeTrust because they're waiting to win for years to come not just one and done
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-11 12:25:33	@Espngreeny he was all excited when he joined him. Now Bosh sounds like a bitter ex. Just like Cleveland did when he left
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-12 14:17:22	@damienwoody no such things wood.  They need a very unlikely win. Not impossible unlikely.  They pressure Peyton they can stay in it
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-12 16:19:03	@coutinho9 difference is under center.  Sanchez may have been shaky in Indy but he was lights out in Foxborough
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-13 20:13:43	@MMarcilla98 find me a non bust since Saban took over there. I can't think of any at all
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-13 22:00:48	@RealMichaelKay you and Don say they'd be clowns. No one no matter how bad they are say a word about Giants.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-13 22:01:34	@jemelehill @wingoz when it becomes about rules not them losing money
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-13 22:02:06	@michaelgbaron @THENATUREBOY1 who in their malformed mind wrote that article
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-15 21:22:04	@cavsdan does your new media contract include being broadcasted on the iheart radio app. Cavs fan in NY who wants to hear games
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-17 09:57:18	@robinlundberg funny these are the same fans that blasted Sanchez for bad play and he had less.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-17 10:10:39	@robinlundberg they blasted him after 3 when half the team quit down the stretch. After 2 years he won 4 playoff games.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-17 17:50:27	@GreenLanternJet yet he was criticized for being himself and probably told to tone it down.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-23 15:00:21	@robertbrender there's big win. Two years and Nimmo is ready.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-24 16:36:06	@MetsKevin11 @Joelsherman1 @Buster_ESPN gardy a better fit for Mets thoughts

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-26 18:28:48	@damienwoody maybe. My 2nd home has a contender.  Go Browns
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-29 10:28:22	@kevinburkhardt @MLBONFOX hope youre hosting next year at your old stomping grounds. The Shea Bridge surrounded by the @The7LineArmy
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-29 11:16:41	@MikeAndMike i love how media says baseball is falling behind wonder why have listened since 6 more about cfb and nfl than game 7. Joke
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-10-31 10:28:26	@Espngreeny i dont care if its Halloween.  Im glad im now a browns fan. You have stabbed all jets fans in the heart. #traitor

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-11-28 19:28:20	@coutinho9 hey Rich i hope they get to the Super Bowl with him under center. Having weapons changes a lot
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-11-30 00:24:18	@Espngreeny should never have been one. This system is going to make conference champs obsolete
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-11-30 14:21:49	@PaulFeinbaum warrick won the heisman as a wideout
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-12-01 13:22:23	@MikeAndMike if bucks dont get pass on new qb and loss to VT then they shouldnt be penalized for losing JT. Committee is no better than BCS
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-12-03 11:25:11	@MikeAndMike 8 team playoff. 5 big conference champs 3 at large. Let committee pick at large and do the seeding. It only adds one more game
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-12-05 22:22:15	@AdamSchein @SNYtv flores will be fine at short. No one blows anykne away. Holes with all guys that have been brought up
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-12-07 13:39:42	@dannykanell how is MSU worse than Oklahoma.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-12-07 14:26:49	@espnradio you do 8 teams. 5 conf champs get in committee picks 3 at large. Thats the best way. The conference champs ar diminished now
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-12-08 13:53:51	@michaelgbaron that would prove the owners didnt learn from Kaz Matsui
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-12-08 15:50:27	@jbbigbear youre a beast
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-12-11 16:25:37	@robertbrender @mikeya78 what legit shortstop is a guaranteed upgrade from Flores projections that wont cost the farm system or a real farm

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-12-29 19:09:03	@ThaJTL that's a solid philosophy.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-12-29 20:39:16	@jeffpearlman thats the same stretch used in the fast and the furious
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2014-12-29 22:32:17	@SGSR_OSU they couldn't cover Sammy Watkins though.

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-01-02 06:08:44	@espnbob bob the top teams in the SEC west all lost. Is it bad games or they just beat each other up and arent that much better over all

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-01-30 01:13:43	@commishjoe @wagsk13wjs_e if Billy gets in Franco should have been there already
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-01-30 02:08:19	@commishjoe 422 saves and was a bridge from the multi inning saves to the more specialized guys of today. I disagree. He belongs
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-01-30 02:51:17	@commishjoe yhe all time saves leader is going in. First ballot no if ands or buts. Hoffman most likely gets in. Why not the lefty leader
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-01-30 02:53:14	@commishjoe i get that now here is another. How many times did wagner get one out saves or go more than one inning it was a different time
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-01-30 02:55:31	@commishjoe so if dominant is the measuring tape then how long did they have to be. Eck was mediocre starter. Then for 5 years was great

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-03-04 11:21:38	@MikeAndMike he has one thing in Buffalo he never had with the Jets. Sammy Watkins. Never had a big time WR in NY.

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-03-03 16:14:53	@The7Line what is the largest size you guys offer. I would love a 7 line shirt but I'm a big dude who wears 3 and 4x
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-03-03 16:17:03	@The7Line thank you. I tell everyone I know about you guys. Hoping to get to a 7 line army event too #LGM

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-03-07 10:58:55	@Buster_ESPN I saw @michaelgbaron said the key was how he felt today. Do you agree
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-03-07 10:59:34	@matthewcerrone @Buster_ESPN he's the hero Queens deserves

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-03-11 17:21:47	@damienwoody I'm a Sanchez guy. He didn't have a whole lot after the first 2 years. I'll give Geno this year
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-03-13 10:45:55	@Buster_ESPN are you seriously kidding. As far as baseball goes it is the best team song ever. It's been on TV and is a staple since 1962
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-03-13 10:47:43	@Buster_ESPN and you can't get to the blog from the link http://t.co/B6speRjIRR

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-03-22 19:18:25	@AdamRubinESPN none of them are checked. There's a really bad joke/prank in there
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-03-22 19:24:33	@MetsBooth happy spring Maj. Nice to see you and hear the guys again
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-03-23 18:08:04	@MetsBooth how long until Howie tells everyone his handle it would be a thrill to speak to someone with his knowledge about the Mets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-03-23 23:54:08	@ChrisRose @IntentionalTalk the Royals it is after all an odd numbered year
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-03-25 17:57:19	@MetsBooth Josh is killing me Maj

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-06 16:33:03	@MarcCarig let's see what happens.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-06 16:37:48	@120Sports he didn't compare them. He said to have patience.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-06 16:38:21	@kevinburkhardt Mets fans miss you KB
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-08 09:56:08	@robinlundberg the Mets. Pitching wins titles. Don't need big hitting need timely hitting
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-08 09:57:43	@robinlundberg how many runs did the Royals and giants score last year. I agree however that's where timely hitting comes in
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-08 10:02:03	@robinlundberg 1 game in. Let's see. Love the show man. Makes my morning that much better
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-08 11:40:16	@MikeAndMike #BallparkEats not a different food. Make the helmets you get ice cream in the size of the helmets that are worn
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-08 11:48:30	@MikeAndMike #ballparkfood make the ice cream helmets the size of the helmets worn by the players. #sundaebar

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-13 18:33:16	@michaelgbaron as well he should be celebrated. http://t.co/NfRGofcElZ
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-14 18:53:07	@michaelgbaron thanks for the heads up. Now for the next search item. Anyone have the whole thing. Trainers coaches bench players etc
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-14 14:08:48	@Mets is there somewhere that has our full roster intro
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-14 16:33:28	@keith_gabelman @Mets looking for entire squad not just starting lineup. Thanks for the heads up though

452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-15 17:29:21	@SheaDugout what exactly is the disaster
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-15 17:31:26	@SheaDugout coming from those guys I'm worried..... not really
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-15 17:33:50	@SheaDugout it's Harvey envy http://t.co/veE8aUeeG0
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-15 18:04:31	@adnanESPN you rhine he poured milk in the box
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-15 21:28:21	@HammerNation19 I listen on TuneIn and I love you guys. Cleveland kid in NY
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-15 01:57:11	@Phillies don't take out one of ours. Lucky that Ace didn't take his hand off
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-16 01:35:16	@bigmetsfan1 we need to bury this team early
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-16 01:38:50	@bigmetsfan1 I agree. Although I hate the phillies so burying them is priority 1 http://t.co/0kKIkdrBnm
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-15 23:47:15	@MetsBooth what no greasy fast Italian tank reference
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-15 23:51:23	@TheHappyRecap @Metsochist4Life I don't think Al drank as much or did as many drugs
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-15 23:54:37	@MetsBooth I feel like the fans are Adrian when she wakes up. Just tells him to win
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-15 23:55:09	@TheHappyRecap @Metsochist4Life true but he had Casey
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-15 09:57:41	@robinlundberg here's the truth if he was on the Yankees over publicising wouldn't matter
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-17 01:15:35	@michaelgbaron y pu think it's his age Mike
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-18 00:18:43	@MetsBooth tell Josh the notification came over last night
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-19 14:43:29	@espnradio somebody ask John Barry how what he just thought the Cavs would do if it is anything different than what Miami did for 4 years
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-19 14:53:50	@espnradio it's deGrom Friday Harvey Saturday
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-20 11:21:09	@Espngreeny he's not gonna beat Urban. Go Bucks
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-22 09:36:46	@Buster_ESPN no hitch in his delivery but a huge one in his swing. Could we see the reverse Ankiel
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-23 10:26:44	@MikeAndMike how about the best team in baseball the New York Mets. http://t.co/U2xZBBxiRl
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-23 12:13:37	@Espngreeny Mikes only minute of importance
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-22 12:34:16	@Buster_ESPN #bleachertweets is Ike Davis a candidate for the "reverse Ankiel" since he is still struggling at the plate? Always liked Ike
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-24 11:44:50	@criscarter80 hey CC I'm a Buckeye who live in NY. Loved the video from the White House. O H
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-24 12:15:30	@jemelehill he needs Snoop to record the title
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-29 00:17:25	@MetsBooth @joshlewinstuff if Max doesn't like it he should have stayed in the AL. Leave the game the way it's supposed to be played.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-29 00:18:03	@michaelgbaron good pitching negates good hitting.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-30 10:17:17	@jeremypiven personally PCU is my favorite
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-30 10:18:39	@DangeRussWilson that is my favorite line in Bond history
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-30 10:19:15	@jeffpearlman the second one was better
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-30 11:07:35	@MikeAndMike Devan Smith. He's a Buckeye like the hall of fame on the show and the best deep threat in the draft O H
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-30 14:28:42	@GreenLanternJet need line and a deep threat. Cooper is more a possession type. When he has corners that can run with him he's not as good
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-30 14:31:24	@damienwoody where do you see the Jets going with this pick Wood
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-01 19:28:15	@CJ12_ I thought it was hysterical. Not saying I didn't freak a little. But thought it was funny
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-01 21:04:05	@AdamSchein @SNYtv @ChrisCarlinSNY @LoudMouths smith is the best deep threat in the draft. Look up his numbers. All TDs over 20 yds #gobucks
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-01 10:46:27	@criscarter80 where do you think Devan Smith and Michael Bennett will go
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-04-30 12:13:16	@jareddiamond he played in the California Penal League
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-04 20:01:18	@HammerNation19 he's insane. Cavs in 5
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-04 09:42:31	@robinlundberg the Jets getting the best deep threat in the draft and maybe the best player.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-04 10:10:47	@Espngreeny Devin Smith I'd gonna be huge greeny
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-04 10:19:32	@TaraJMac seriously. On a side note let's go mets
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-04 10:20:31	@robinlundberg thanks for the on air read. Made my morning.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-04 16:12:07	@The7Line I can't stand the defeatist attitude. #LGM
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-05 17:17:21	@coutinho9 piazza seaver wright keith. Two biggest traded and two best homegrown players
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-06 17:24:10	@The7Line Kingston. I'm upstate lol
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-07 10:14:49	@MikeAndMike whether or not it helped he broke a rule. He also went to TSUN so it doesn't surprise me. #GoBucks
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-07 10:41:49	@OSUCoachMeyer get well soon coach
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-07 10:51:25	@espngolic how many carries did Blount have in the second half. He threw it 7 less times. Colts were geared for run. That may be difference
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-06 19:54:21	@SheaDugout seaver hernandez piazza wright
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-07 16:26:12	@Metsochist4Life wait if you do Colon  Harvey Lagares it makes more sense
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-07 17:24:53	@CJ12_ I agree.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-08 08:10:49	@Sanchy43 me neither man
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-10 13:08:56	@espnradio Brady went to TSUN they are not quite as intelligent as the rest of us #gobucks
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-10 14:43:36	@Weerd_Science @msimonespn because they don't run on him anymore
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-10 14:55:13	@Weerd_Science @msimonespn I most likely am wrong about this but not many have come with men in base.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-11 10:41:00	@Espngreeny can't believe you forgot Sanchez scratched a run and threw to Braylon in Indy 2010 WC game to set up Nick Folk FG to win
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-13 12:49:42	@coutinho9 so we give up a power left handed arm for an oft injured stats swelled by his home park player who when his deal is up will bolt
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-13 16:21:58	@robertbrender so if we do the lines from Major League 2 you think anyone will get it
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-14 12:15:18	@nymets945 it's May 13. Last I checked the last day of the season was in early October. Peaks and valleys all year long
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-15 10:14:53	@RyanRuocco can I get a shout out for a Cavs fan living in Ulster County
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-15 10:18:06	@Sanchy40 that  usual is hysterical
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-16 13:20:41	@Sanchy40 the visual of you faceplanting on a treadmill cuz. Made me chuckle lol. Show this to your dad http://t.co/632KgZac2S
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-16 00:41:32	@MetsBooth Piazza made his debut against the Brewers and Jeff Juden
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-17 00:43:23	@MetsBooth and David hit a 3 run shot
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-18 10:22:50	@espngolic @Espngreeny 2004 Yankees. The biggest ever. Mo on the bump with 2 ours up 3 zip. Lose series in 7
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-18 10:25:50	@MikeAndMike 2004 New York Yankees. Only team to ever lose 3 zip lead in 7 game series in baseball history. #epiccollapse #pullingayankee
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-19 01:15:44	@MetsBooth I hear Howie say Lt Harris and I think Police Academy.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-21 02:34:01	@HammerNation19 the question is can they D up to stop our run
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-20 15:27:44	@AmazinAvenue I agree. The defeatist attitude of some fans really bugs me. Anybody realize what we have on the DL besides Wright  d'Arnaud
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-20 14:52:13	@AmazinAvenue it's funny most thought so when they won 11 in a row. It's May 20. When we get to July 1 then state panicking
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-20 19:15:26	@SNYtv @kevinburkhardt interviewing Johan Santana after the no hitter. A nig gf I never thought would come and one I will never forget
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-21 15:52:38	@MetsOfficials @brianpmangan or we'd be worse because he's striking out at a higher pace than ever before
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-22 15:45:15	@CavsJMike was at the Q in March. I'm an East side boy who relocated. Here's to a run to the finals http://t.co/bI2cv1YsC2
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-22 15:39:07	@CavsJMike I live in upstate NY and I listen to every game on NBA Gametime. You guys are the best #gocavs
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-25 14:07:04	@AdamRubinESPN quality Billy reference Adam
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-25 14:31:44	@SirFranksnBacon this Cleveland kid that lives in NY loves Delly. Screw Horford and the Hawks. Time to play for the title. Pansies go home
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-25 12:42:41	@Espngreeny so Garapolo is no Brady but Matt Cassell went 11-5 in same system. Let's see what happens
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-25 13:06:59	@MikeAndMike the 49 to 53 Yankees as much as it bothers me to point out
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-26 10:24:23	@MikeAndMike has he been fixed yet. If he hasn't he should be worried. #shrinkage #bradydog
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-26 10:28:01	@MikeAndMike name the dog football. That way they never have to worry about him being overweight #bradydog
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-26 16:38:05	@TaigBeLike interesting
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-27 00:50:11	@ChrisMannixSI @SirFranksnBacon you can tell who's classy and who the southern rednecks are. Screw the turtle doves and they're broadcasters
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-27 10:38:46	@espngolic we should have a shirt made with a sandwich and his number. #dellyismyguytoo
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-27 10:40:43	@MikeAndMike they're 46-14 since LeBron went and watched Ohio State win the National Title.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-27 11:48:49	@MikeAndMike @jaysonst Kershaw Verlander Lincecum price
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-29 02:11:11	@704jo @nymets945 me go bucks
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-29 14:23:43	@ESPNCleveland do you think Cardale Jones is a target if he plays well this year
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-29 09:52:06	@robinlundberg cleveland championship
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-29 10:11:08	@MikeAndMike the US and Canada are voting for Aladdin's alter ego to run FIFA. He'd still be better
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-29 22:27:04	@Hot_For_Food is it bad I want him to go. #12gauge
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-01 21:16:13	@kevinburkhardt we miss you KB. They are for real. Can't wait till you do Fox pre game from the Shea Bridge in October
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-01 21:19:33	@BHOOLZ a ton of people I know in NY saying their D is not good enough to contain Curry and Thompson.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-01 21:29:55	@kevinburkhardt gonna watch you on DVD tonight. I think you remember this one right http://t.co/y8HvHEWAmm
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-05-31 21:56:31	@Hot_For_Food if Urban turns him into Percy Harvin we could be even more dynamic
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-03 00:01:05	@dannyzip welcome to twitter world
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-02 09:59:46	@robinlundberg LeBron never had a top 50 all time player on his team. Bulls won 52 year after he left. Big difference
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-01 13:55:37	@SheaDugout at home doing date night with wife. Buddy called and said Johan has no no through 6. Turned game on. Now own game on DVD
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-03 11:53:46	@MikeAndMike tribe won division every year from 95 to 99
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-05 01:19:05	@espn how come you don't have the radio broadcast on the app.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-05 10:24:50	@MikeAndMike LeBron was great last night. Couldn't hear it as Pod center was played on the Espn radio app. #Ridiculousness
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-05 10:53:04	@Espngreeny preach greeny. I'm tired of the comparison crap. Last time I checked MJ had a hell of a lot more help. Not just in Cle but SB 2
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-05 11:07:54	@metspolice @Gleichit we really are the only fan base that first place means nothing unless we bitch about it. It's getting really old
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-05 11:48:05	@Espngreeny no he would have kicked it to Kerr or Paxson
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-04 13:30:22	I’m going with the Cavs! #SCFinalsVote @SportsCenter http://t.co/Xoyiott7Fm
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-05 22:42:25	@HammerNation19 Aaron you are a genius. Have Cardale there too
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-04 13:57:32	Hey all my tribe fan friends. Give @SPORTalkIndians a shot. Go tribe
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-06 14:39:09	@ESPNDari hate to break it to you TSUN is not a factor in the mid west either #gobucks http://t.co/bzOENlDgik
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-06 19:01:43	@CavsJMike is there another way to listen to you guys online. The Gametime app didn't work and I heart didn't have the game. Need game 2
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-07 18:56:24	@SNCleveland @CosicDanny I made that puck a week ago and I'm sticking with it. Better on D with no Kyrie. #myguydelly http://t.co/klmJSLowjH
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-07 21:06:26	@MarcCarig love you in the 4th inning. Strongly disagree with you tonight. #gocavs http://t.co/9GHXE2KBMY
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-07 21:19:29	@matthewdelly @cavs you're my guy Delly. We're all behind you http://t.co/4UMUAqtHVy
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-08 10:48:32	@MikeAndMike you guys are spitting in the wind. When a guy has another top 50 of all time with him he better damn well win.#Pippenisinhof
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-07 14:37:31	@dannykanell then how was secretariat in the top athletes if the 20th century
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-09 10:36:04	@MikeAndMike just look at Mike Scott 86 NLCS. Mets win series in 6 and Scott MVP. LeBron is the MVP if the Cavs win or it goes 7.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-08 20:28:13	@HammerNation19 2 of the 3 members are from Columbus. Big Buckeye guys and I'm sure they'll be cheering loud
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-10 12:33:03	@robinlundberg would the next line be because the cavs are too mattylicious
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-10 01:23:36	@HammerNation19 do you guys have that Dellabration song on YouTube somewhere
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-10 16:17:28	@stephenasmith thanks for the belief in my boys. Cavs in 6 http://t.co/5x8CVpehbU
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-10 18:30:01	@msimonespn @Optimetstic no one will because all our fan base likes to do is complain. Remember the 73 team won 83 games and won division
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-10 18:32:18	@msimonespn @Optimetstic oh damn one off. Harvey bounces back tonight
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-12 02:57:54	@Hot_For_Food ohio lets no team in blue and yellow beat them http://t.co/M0aB6mcBKT
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-11 09:59:01	@robinlundberg  Cincinnati is 5 hours from Cleveland
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-11 10:14:14	@robinlundberg yeah. When I first moved there I didn't think Ohio was that big
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-11 11:41:43	@espngolic do you think of Airplane or Saturday Night Fever when you hear that song
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-13 18:56:14	@sammayrae now listening to Bohemian Rhapsody
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-13 18:35:29	@sammayrae I too am hysterical. Just more sports minded.
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-15 14:29:57	@MarcCarig so are all the Warriors fans gonna chip in and buy Kelly Olenyk a house or a car #wewinwithlove
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-15 20:28:08	@Espngreeny last time I checked Greeny this series isn't over yet. http://t.co/CF8DzSQH72
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-17 12:43:45	@MarcCarig I'll give it to you Marc. Can't wait to hear you tonight in the 4th... and see you in the finals next year http://t.co/YmfUKAd48i
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-17 12:50:56	@The7Line @matthewcerrone I think this could be Ace by committee. Which with as deep as the pitching is may not be a bad thing
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-17 16:01:55	@Hot_For_Food looks good right http://t.co/VlotXgXDHj
452441165	MetsJetsBucks41	2015-06-19 19:29:34	@egoldie80 I hear Draymond Green took a shot at the Cavs today. Too bad he couldn't hit one any other time. Trashy move
