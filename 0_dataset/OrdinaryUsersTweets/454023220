454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-25 22:36:57	@Sainted7 the club have said that it is illness for the reason he didn't travel
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-25 22:41:45	sounds like Lallana has strained his neck from the weight of his big head! 
He is out injured for 6 weeks! Lol 🙉😂 #saintsfc #LFC
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 01:58:33	at the Bournemouth game earlier this evening #selfie #didireally #OMG 😳 http://t.co/aq91M4A7Vi
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-25 22:42:43	@Sainted7 I didn't say I believed it; just stating that the club have said it's an illness and not an injury
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-25 22:43:54	I am the first person to be positive about the goings on at #saintsfc but even I am starting to worry with the number of players leaving! 😁😁
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-25 23:03:57	there's some serious shit going down and I don't like it #saintsfc #InTheDark
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 13:53:50	so Koeman has kinda lifted the lid on transfers. has, also, said that he doesn't discuss names of people we r after. It's coming #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 14:36:05	Oh dear god! I have just witnessed someone asking where Croatia is and proceeding to ask if it is in Africa?!?! 
WOW! 👀
🙈😳🙉😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 15:15:34	@Sainted7 for me, if the club were to sell Fonte to Cardiff that wud be worrying but selling players to better clubs 4 gd money isn't 1/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:11:19	in relation 2 my last tweet, hes not 21 either! 
It's reports like that this that help me to ignore a lot of the crap rumours lol #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:15:54	@pgeddes82_paul I always try &amp; stay positive about saints but today is the 1st day doubt has crept in. We are still on top of the bottom 1/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:23:40	@granthale01 need ur money?!? Haha it's actually quite flattering that Liverpool &amp; every1 else want many of our players. We have the talent
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:35:56	@granthale01 don't class it as biting as I ❤️ the banter. Stuff like this is great! 👏😀👏 
What's the matter, u run out of things 2 say?!? 👀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:41:13	@Chris_FN_Ward according to Villa he isn't going anywhere but there is a defender coming I believe, just prob not Vlaar
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:56:16	@mattsmirk yeah that wudnt surprise me after hearing Celtic's manager's interview about Forster; said pretty much that. Boruc gd till then
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 15:14:40	@Sainted7 won't be completely relying on youngster tho as more signings will come in &amp; at least 7 of the players I mentioned have experience
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:08:56	http://t.co/TzGLkXAb2C
WOW! If ur going to report on something, u need to get ur facts right. 7 million for chambers 😂😂😂😂 #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:18:25	@granthale01 r u just jealous coz Liverpool didn't go for him &amp; u are stuck with johnshit?!? Haha 😂😂😂😂 #decent #comeback
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:24:51	@granthale01 u must b pleased that gerrard has retired from international footy coz he can now fully concentrate on cocking up the league 😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:29:33	@granthale01 already spotted ur mistake! #tooslow 
Gd job our talent like sitting on the bench coz its sumthing they will have 2 get used 2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:38:20	Liverpool can have lovren if it means we will get Vlaar. 
Vlaar is a better player in my opinion #saintsfc #LFC
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:43:28	Forster &amp; Van Dijk were left out Celtic's friendly last night I believe. 
Maybe they were 'ill' whilst passing their medicals at #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:46:38	@granthale01 u must know how saints are feeling as Liverpool have also sold the player that carried them last season #suarez #animal
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:51:43	@ShonaSaintsB correction to this tweet, the game was played this afternoon not last night; apologises
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:53:01	@mattsmirk and saints do that in pre-season as well &amp; everyone is reporting the whole squad is leaving lol 
Believe Van Dijk is coming here
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 20:12:59	@TSBible not at all; thats the type of lad he is. He started clapping when the fans sang 'Tadic makes Lallana look shite' last night 👍
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 21:41:32	I told this joke a few weeks ago but I still laughed a little bit seeing this #saintsfc http://t.co/D8g1pGgdf4
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 17:07:24	I like to have a laugh &amp; joke about things but the mentality of the ppl actually wishing harm to Lallana after his injury is just ridiculous
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 21:24:34	@SimonPeach exactly what I have been saying! I'm glad there is someone else who is keeping things in perspective  a little bit 👍😀😜
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 08:44:48	hearing that the club didn't lie about Chambers being ill 4 Friday night coz he was 4 a few days prior. However, he does still want the move
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 12:59:25	“@Drinkfootie: Watch Southampton do a madness and buy Hummels, Pogba &amp; Cavani. #saintsfc”
Haha love this 😀⚽️😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 14:00:47	not a fan of formula 1 but hearing Hamilton has driven himself from the pit lane to 3rd makes me think "what a race!!" 
Well done Lewis 👏👏
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 18:54:51	rumours r doing the rounds that Liverpool may get investigated 4 tapping up players. Don't know how much truth there is in it tho #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 19:15:05	@mattsmirk lambert said in his first interview for Liverpool that Gerrard spoke to him whilst on England duty. They're now after J Rod too
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 19:43:30	@sammcqueen123 gd luck for the new season Sam. Looking forward to seeing u &amp; the rest of the new boys play. Love 2 see some passion 😀⚽️❤️
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 20:31:49	@granthale01 yeah the last time Liverpool were in town was just hilarious! Lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 20:40:37	@granthale01 I don't know why u are laughing coz u have spent over 45 million buying half that squad 😂😂😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 12:10:25	really hoping that people cheer up once the season has started! Lol
Things cud be better but happy that players who don't wanna play leave
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 12:13:54	@Darrenwbee70 exactly my point. think they take gr8 pleasure in ripping into #saintsfc 🙈
I am still confident &amp; looking forward 2 the season
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 13:01:49	@Darrenwbee70 so do I Darren. Here's hoping 👍😜
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 13:17:03	@IngsDanny pls RT as I'm doing a skydive for the Saints Foundation &amp; the liver &amp; pancreas cancer charity #saintsfc http://t.co/u9Pm621n4A

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 13:44:05	pls everyone donate as much as u can for a great &amp; worthy cause. These ppl do gd work &amp; deserve ur donations http://t.co/u9Pm621n4A 😀❤️😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 14:12:47	Liverpool pulled out of the deal 2 sign Remy after they realised he wasn't a Southampton player &amp; they couldn't use their loyalty points 😂😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 14:19:42	@ShaunSadler only thing I can think of is that a deal can be done in principle. I don't see J Rod going injured or not
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 14:28:53	@swindess3 my proof that i don't watch formula 1 haha 
Perhaps he shid get a better car so he starts on the grid &amp; wins the race 😂😜😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 14:40:34	does any1 think it's normal/weird 2 receive a friend request from a friends gf on Facebook half an hr after u have spoken to them?!? #random
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 15:01:44	watching Magic Mike on a Sunday afternoon :-) #channingtatum #matthewmcconaughey
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 20:53:09	@granthale01 did exaggerate a little there but uve spent 45 mill on 3 pub team players which is worse than 45 mill on 6 pub team players 😂😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 22:06:22	@lloyd_isgrove well played on Friday night; you were MOTM for me. Such a good work rate and pace on the wing. Gd luck for the new season ⚽️
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 19:52:42	I like football but Liverpool?!?! Liverpool can f*ck off 👍😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 19:56:04	lovren has told a Croatian paper he signed the Liverpool contract on sat night &amp; will be announced 11pm tonight b4 the club confirm #twat
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 20:01:32	@stucasey7 agree with which one?!? :-) I cannot see which tweet ur replying too lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 20:10:32	@granthale01 I have better things to do with my time than watch the comedy channel 😜😂😜
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 21:41:51	it's too little too late from Lovren in my eyes. He has already disrespected the club &amp; the fans. 
Hope u get want u want in the end
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-28 00:06:40	my mum always told me to not say anything at all if I have nothing nice to say. 

This must be my cue to go to bed then lol 😀😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-25 23:23:01	Lallana was obviously worried about facing Saints on the first day of the season and has got himself injured lol @granthale01
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-25 23:24:53	with schneiderlin also on his way to Arsenal, I am beginning to worry about the goings on at the club. This isn't looking good at the mo 😁
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 00:45:18	part of the wide awake club tonight! 👀😁
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 11:04:36	OMG! What has tulisa done to her face?!? I didn't even recognise her 🙈😮 http://t.co/UaAYDheGVT
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 14:56:14	gutted we've sold as many players as we have but been gd business &amp; still have a gd nucleus of players 2 carry us.  Will not be relegated!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 15:06:58	@Sainted7 isgrove, reed and I go on. We need to make signings, which are coming, as u can't have the backbone of the team as youngsters 2/3
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 15:07:41	@Sainted7 but the majority of a good team is there. There are some players being linked away that just won't go in my opinion :-) 3/3
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 15:16:16	@Sainted7 the end of the world. Don't get me wrong, not a great feeling at the mo but will not see us relegated. We have talent 2/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:16:50	@pgeddes82_paul half of the table with those players leaving. Have some gd players, youngsters &amp; new signings to come. Keep believing 😀 2/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:27:02	@granthale01 helps if u tag the person in the reply when u are talking to them! Lol 🙈 #fail
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:30:52	@granthale01 don't worry coz I'm sure u will be selling them for a fraction of the cost in a season or 2 anyways #theliverpoolway hehe
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:33:58	@granthale01 whilst ur online, don't forget to donate on my just giving page for my skydive 😀😀 http://t.co/u9Pm621n4A 
U know it makes sense
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 16:53:53	@Chris_FN_Ward yeah already reckon Van Dijk &amp; poss Forster are on their way to saints
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 17:00:35	@mattsmirk well Van Dijk is a CB &amp; will sign before window closes IMO. Yoshida ok squad player but sadly hooiveld isn't gd enuf
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 17:02:08	@Chris_FN_Ward Van Dijk &amp; Fonte in starting 11 &amp; Yoshida is a gd squad player. Will need one to replace hooiveld IMO &amp; Redmond on the wing
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 17:11:59	Van Gaal is making Cleverley captain for their friendly tonight 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
He is the riskmiester as we saw in the WC so this cud be interesting
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-26 21:00:36	@ArturBoruc is a proper lad 😀😜 
Love the banter that him and Fonte give and show #saintsfc http://t.co/BidB5yELdN
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 11:58:56	haha 😂😂😂
Clearly there is nothing better 2 write about than #saintsfc at the moment. 
Reality - not all those r going http://t.co/ikXFNjFSRA
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 12:01:44	the prices written are wrong &amp; the players wanting to go are. Fonte, J Rod, Ramirez &amp; schneiderlin from that pic won't go IMO #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 13:23:14	@SchneiderlinMo4 pls RT as Im doing a skydive 4 the Saints Foundation and liver &amp; pancreas cancer charity #saintsfc  http://t.co/u9Pm621n4A
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 14:18:17	@ShaunSadler of course what gets printed is rubbish! Lol 
He can't pass a medical if he can't even play for saints till at least October
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-27 14:23:56	Remy failed a medical at Liverpool so the deal is off. J Rod hasnt played since Apr &amp; not fit till Oct but heading 2 Spurs 😂😂 #rumourlogic
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-28 17:37:23	“@NOT_MOTD: BREAKING: Southampton have announced a 5-a-side friendly with Blackpool.” Haha 😂😂
❤️ this
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-28 17:38:01	@shaunlovelock it's already started as I have been invited to a protest group on Facebook today
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-28 17:50:21	hey @IngsDanny you're a Saints man, fancy learning how to play RB or CB and come and join the Saints?!? Hehe 😂😂 #exodus #5aside #nextseason
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-30 07:23:23	Come on @SchneiderlinMo4 time 2 show every1 that ur the true professional we know u r. Its what u do on the pitch that matters; wherever u r
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 17:28:10	Haha players leave &amp; #saintsfc r mentioned on sky sports news every 5 mins but when we r looking 2 sign players, there's hardly any mention
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 17:32:27	@joanne_sawola ridiculous the amount they like 2 slate us. Perhaps they see us as an easy target or something. Time 2 believe kreugers words
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 17:38:19	Krueger is 100% right wen he said we have got rid of the players who want a quick cut thru to champions league football. #believe #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 17:43:21	@joanne_sawola @hockey_james @Koeman1963 out best form of revenge on the haters &amp; the doubters is breaking into Europe on our own COYR
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 17:46:44	@joanne_sawola @hockey_james @Koeman1963 I heard that too. I had a little wobble of doubt over the weekend tho wen we didn't hear anything
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 17:55:34	“@SchneiderlinMo4: 6 years of an amazing journey #saintsfc DESTROYED in 1 hour !!!” 
thinking that he was staying was 2 good 2 b true then👀😮
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 18:00:54	@joanne_sawola @SchneiderlinMo4 true but not sure we need players at the club that don't wanna be there. Hurt really that it's come to this
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 18:06:41	what a sad world we live in where highly paid footballers take to twitter to slag off their club. 
Absolutely no respect or class #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 18:27:05	Oh well! At least we are making 2 or 3 signing this week; I hope! 😁😁 lol

Just wanna sit in a dark room &amp; rock myself 2 sleep at the mo 😂😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-30 17:32:35	so some of the media outlets DO know how 2 write &amp; talk bout positive things at #saintsfc then! Lol 
Always been underrated so bring it on!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-28 18:15:47	u know what annoys me more than the players leaving the club?!? The fans moaning about it &amp; taking 2 twitter &amp; Facebook 2 slag then off! 😁🙉😁
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-28 18:50:38	u lot are depressing me and I have resorted to having a drink!! Haha 🍺🍺
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-28 19:12:28	“@ThePuntersPage: BREAKING - Ronaldinho is now a free agent.
Bring him to the Premier League!”
This is who Saints have been waiting for 😂😂😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-28 19:14:33	@derekfrankie they certainly are but I don't think attacking the club or the players on twitter &amp; Facebook is gonna get them anywhere
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 19:01:03	as pissed off as I am at schneiderlin wanting out, a little part of me doesn't blame him as the club have allowed several others 2 leave 1/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 19:01:47	They haven't set an example to stand firm until now. It is really sad to see what is happening at the club right now #saintsfc 2/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 19:33:36	“@solentsport: GOAL #pompey 0-3 #afcb, Harry Arter”
It cud be worse 👀😂😂 #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 19:36:18	@NikkiSanderson @Mr_JSheffield you are both truly brilliant actors. Absolutely fantastic portrayal of an abusive relationship 👏👏 #Hollyoaks

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-30 20:45:42	@VictoriaLouise_ hehe how's it going with him there? Have things changed much? xx
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-30 22:57:03	so the media interview Adkins &amp; Lowe about the goings on at #saintsfc
How about they interview someone who actually works at the club!?! Lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 19:47:50	http://t.co/jttxcytkES 
Very good article this one #Saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 20:29:14	@pp_cycle definitely. I get annoyed that ppl say I am being blind or using rose tinted glasses when I say positive things. We are not alone
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 20:56:10	my day is complete coz I have just won £10 on a scratch card! Whoop whoop 🎉🎉
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 21:03:19	@joanne_sawola haha very good although on around 20-30 thousand a week, he can buy his own dummy and tissues
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 21:06:59	@lloyd_isgrove almost a full line up for #saintsfc next season 👍😜
🎶 these boys are loyal 🎶
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 21:59:30	understand that Vlaar &amp; his agent r 2 hold talks with Villa amid claims of interest from #saintsfc 
Wud b a fantastic replacement 4 lovren
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-30 17:41:29	Prem league has confirmed they will use the vanishing spray nxt season. 
Think #saintsfc have already got some in the dressing room! 😂😂😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-30 17:50:52	@mattsmirk yes really. Can't win whatever we do; the media seems to hate us! Lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-30 17:51:49	@Sainted7 lol I am making light of the situation and making a joke. Come on! 😜

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-30 19:39:18	Shaw is too fat for Utd, lallana is out for 6 wks &amp; lovren is training with the kids as he can't get a visa. If carlsberg did transfers... 😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-30 19:54:47	less than a week until the Liverpool away tickets go on sale!! :-) absolutely buzzing for this one!! 😀⚽️😀 #saintsfc

Seriously tho, the more u underestimate us, the better we'll b
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-30 21:22:20	#saintsfc after Forster, Celtic want him 2 stay 4 Champions League &amp; 2night Celtic crash 2 a 4-1 defeat in qualification. Coincidence?!? Lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-30 23:07:25	@NeilSFC I'm guessing the '"lol" at the end of that statement didnt give away the fact that I was joking?!?! Haha :-)
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 12:50:00	Some ppl make me laugh hehe I'm guessing they r referring 2 the plastics who wudnt have bought the tickets #saintsfc http://t.co/rqgOHb3m59
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 12:55:56	support ur club &amp; not just the players in it. I've always said, players come &amp; go with no loyalty but there will always be a club #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 22:02:55	also hearing that Forster &amp; Rojo are 2 b announced as #saintsfc players by end of wk. Rojo wud be gd signing; WC runner up &amp; plays LB &amp; CB
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 17:24:07	really wish I was in Brighton this evening watching Saints play 😀😀
This season really needs to hurry up and start!! ⚽️⚽️⚽️ #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 17:46:55	@simon_leason that's a surprise seeing as we have one every hour according to the media 😂😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 17:58:42	@ryanbertrand3 starts for #saintsfc after signing yesterday. Pleased to see that and Luke Shaw who?!?! 😜😀😜
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 18:45:31	some people take life WAY too seriously. Live a little and learn to have a laugh and a joke between friends 👍 #advice #good
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 23:12:28	looking 4ward 2 @SouthamptonFC &amp; @Koeman1963 proving all the doubters wrong by making more signings &amp; having a top 8 finish again #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 23:25:35	WOW! Ronaldinho to QPR wud be the signing of the summer if it happened 🙉
A number of teams interested in him with QPR being one of them
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-29 23:59:31	Hahaha 😂😂 I've heard it all now! Talksport r saying that saints r bullying schneiderlin 4 not letting him move. WTAF?!?! 🙉🙈 #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-30 00:01:33	@GeniusFootball @FootballFunnys thrown his toys out the pram coz hes been told he can't leave when other players have. Ridiculous behaviour
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 19:07:26	Get in there Tadic with his first goal for #saintsfc ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 19:17:36	@markmunkeypants @TheFutbolSource  media outlet who printed that isn't the most trust worthy. I tend to believe the twitter sites more :-)
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 19:48:28	2-0 to #saintsfc at half time against Brighton &amp; no goals have been conceded pre-season so far. I wud hate to see a club in real crisis! Lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 19:50:23	@markmunkeypants @TheFutbolSource #SSN are only interested in the top 4 clubs (maybe top 6) which is a load of crap! Lol let them carry on
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 20:07:53	@derekfrankie yeah dont doubt he is coz Johnson is their option at the moment 😳😳 lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 20:10:54	@Si_mon_86 we play them first game of the season so probably there for that. Still funny tho hehe
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 20:18:28	@PerturbedMole he will be there coz we play Liverpool in the first game. Was funny to make up tho 👍 hehe
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 20:25:37	Jeez! I can be very sarcastic when I want to be 😮 haha #banter #football
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 20:29:52	@markmunkeypants I'm not sure I can cope with it all Mark. It's just all proving too much right now! 😂😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 13:04:43	@AlGalpin very true Lol 
Even to compare the two completely baffles me!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 17:38:05	Schneiderlin 'unfit' to play for #saintsfc tonight #genius #meltdown
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 19:08:45	Dusan Tadic makes lallana look shite 😀😀😀 #saintsfc 1-0 to the mighty red and white
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 20:00:13	Not content with having just 3 #saintsfc players, there is a Liverpool scout at the saints game tonight! Haha 😂😂 http://t.co/e8NdPS7p2l
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 20:12:11	James Ward-Prowse - you little beauty! What a peach of a goal to make it 3-0 with #saintsfc completely in control ⚽️⚽️
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 20:13:07	@dfarndale I'm guessing he is there coz we play them first game of the season but it was funny anyway hehe 😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 20:19:55	@Si_mon_86 was funny although I have to b careful of the jokes I make as someone unfollowed me the other day for making 1 about saints haha
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 20:24:28	Run 4 cover; the meltdown has started! have conceded a goal through a goalkeeping mistake with our 2nd &amp; soon 2 b 3rd choice keeper 🙈 haha
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 20:28:19	ppl were getting worried about the club but some things never change at #saintsfc 
Davis makes a goalkeeping error &amp; we beat Brighton 👍 😜😜
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 20:30:21	@ShaunSadler very true shaun 👍😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-07-31 20:36:56	even some of the Liverpool supporters are liking my banter tonight. It's good to see and always respect the banter 👍
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-03 06:39:51	2 months at Liverpool and lambert is already missing penalties 😳😂😳 #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-03 06:45:52	btw, I do feel sorry for lambert in my last tweet. I am not laughing at him 👍 #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-03 07:18:21	hoping that the changes 2 @SkySportsNews studio will also include a change 2 the coverage they give teams in the Prem League #allabouttop4
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-01 06:41:21	@Si_mon_86 I know! I shud wash my mouth out with soap &amp; sit in the corner to think about what I have done lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-01 06:56:38	today is, officially, Premier League month with it only being 15 days until the start 😀😀😀 (well 16 for us)

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-02 05:04:58	Lampard to Man City for 6 months?!? I never saw that one coming! Haha
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-01 09:54:57	@Footy @granthale01 must be time for Liverpool to put a bid in for him then! Lol 😂😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-01 13:51:06	about time the media printed rubbish about another club in the premiership! 😀😀 #saintsfc #ManUtd #meltdown http://t.co/DPFxaRryIG

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-01 21:20:56	@ChrisMayhewSAS haha don't feel very hardcore right now 😁😁
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-02 21:38:46	wonder what the odds are 4 Ezequiel Schelotto joining Saints on loan or otherwise?!? 
If I was a betting person, I probably would #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-02 22:11:09	@SaintsFanHub gd job I don't bet coz the opposite always happens when money is involved! Lol 
Must b instead of Taidir as cant imagine both

👍😀😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 20:00:47	I'm out at the mo, is there anyone that can give me the lowdown on the Krueger interview pretty please?!? 😀😀 #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 20:01:34	@ChrisMayhewSAS haha this comment made me smile. I am probably completely wrong but nice to think otherwise! Haha 😜
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 20:09:25	@Stripes_07 thanks Think we have a couple more loan deals imminent &amp; I hear from sky sports that deal 4 Forster is close so fingers crossed
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 20:10:42	@Stripes_07 deffo think the club r working hard on deals &amp; we will have 3 or 4 at least by the time the transfer window closes
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 20:36:23	@Stripes_07 I have seen pretty gd evidence that a deal is in place 4 Forster if/when they don't qualify. He is coming whether now or later
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 20:41:38	@Stripes_07 I haven't heard anything about him for a while; that seems to have gone quiet. Still think it cud be on tho
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 20:50:43	@Stripes_07 I do too. Trouble I think we cud have is that clubs know we have 92 mill in the bank &amp; will try &amp; get more money etc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 20:54:37	@Stripes_07 I know but other clubs won't see it like that. They will look at the players we have sold &amp; drive a hard bargain
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 21:09:05	@Stripes_07 yeah, have no doubt that deals r happening/will happen. People have underestimated us 4 years so they can carry on if they wish
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 21:14:11	there are many reasons why @Hollyoaks Hollyoaks won best soap &amp; they are currently showing them all. Absolutely fantastic; no other words 👏👏
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 21:18:02	@Stripes_07 sounds like they are staying firm on him. Have a look at all the RTs I have done from @SimonPeach lots of gd stuff there 👍
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 21:20:41	Hahaha that is SO me 😂😂 #earlymornings http://t.co/yALACxS2v4
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 23:13:20	Oh no! Sky leading with the story Saints are set for another departure!! Osvaldo going out on loan coz no one saw that coming! 😂 #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 23:29:39	WOW! Some people really know how to hit you right where it hurts 😞😞 #friendship #enemies
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-03 20:13:49	Meet the Fockers is a great film!! 

'Ass.......hoooooole 😂😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-03 20:30:27	@ShaunSadler come on you fockers. Conga! 
I do love this film :-)
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-03 20:33:47	Ben Stiller is a class act but the baby steals the show in this film for me. Superb! #meetthefockers #funny
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-03 22:18:10	English media - Last wk was crisis/meltdown mode &amp; this wk have 92 mill 2 spend &amp; been linked with enuf players for 15 teams! Lol #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 17:39:19	Welcome to @SouthamptonFC @SaphirOfficiel looking forward to a great season for all #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 17:40:48	squad numbers have been announced and there is no one in the number 7 shirt at the mo. Signing on the way?!? I think so 😄⚽️😀 #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 19:25:21	Maybe Forster's head is already in Southampton! Hehe 😂 Celtic have gone 1-0 down and 5-1 on aggregate. Time to make that move to #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 19:30:22	@kevvie_geeSFC not convinced that we will get Hernandez. Really not sure on that one
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 19:31:05	@bdsspw hhhhhmmmmmm lol u can always dream 👍😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 19:35:52	@kevvie_geeSFC ssn reported there is a big signing coming, earlier, but will wait 2 see what happens. We will b getting more signings in IMO
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 19:42:04	@kevvie_geeSFC no course they didn't. They don't like talking about signings coming in at #saintsfc lol only when they leave. No idea yet
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 19:45:29	@kevvie_geeSFC I still think there is more to come and I am already looking forward to the season. Ppl have been too down on us as always
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 19:52:00	@kevvie_geeSFC yeah I can see that. They did a bit of a loyalty thing last season in that ppl who wanted Man Utd had 2 have gone 2 West Brom
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 19:52:20	@kevvie_geeSFC I am fortunate enuf to be able to afford a season ticket 😀😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 19:54:40	@kevvie_geeSFC that wud be good. I cudnt imagine not having a season ticket and saints in my life. It's a horrible thought! Haha
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 19:58:01	@kevvie_geeSFC 2 right. All the talk of protests etc has been ridiculous IMO. I've had belief all the way thru &amp; seems to have got me far 😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 20:12:33	@crstig what channel is the game on?!? Pretty please
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 21:00:38	if Danny Ings does, actually, leave burnley before the end of the transfer window I am gonna kick myself! Shud have put money on it 😁😁 lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 21:47:32	in bed before 11pm must mean there is something wrong with me! Lol
Can't keep my eyes open but so much to do #sleepy #bedtime
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 21:50:15	think I'm gonna give 'being a bitch' a go as being nice clearly doesn't get you anywhere!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-06 21:54:18	the view from my rose tinted glasses is looking pretty good right now 👍😀⚽️ #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 17:12:43	Liverpool away tickets &amp; tickets to see @JohnBishop100 booked in the same day! 😀😀😀
That is what I call 'boss' #saintsfc #johnbishop
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 17:19:56	2 say that Im excited about both the things mentioned in my last tweet would b an understatement! Absolutely buzzing! #saintsfc #johnbishop
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 17:23:54	@courtneylousie5 thank you :-) got to wait until October for John bishop tho. Little while yet x
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 17:24:52	@bdsspw and I do so all good. I wudnt be excited about it or even book the tickets if I didn't find him funny lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 17:27:42	@bdsspw don't worry. No downer here! Plus, he is not everyone's cup of tea 😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 17:29:06	@courtneylousie5 I will but it will depend on the result coz if we are beaten, it won't be such a good time lol x
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 17:42:32	@john_lush and where was my invite?!?! Haha 😮
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 17:57:07	@john_lush Aaahhh what a lovely son you are! 👏

On the move maybe? Cud my previous prediction be correct??
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 18:02:01	@sturge198 not necessarily us but I think he cud be on the move. Very intriguing and I wud have him at saints. Plus he's saints thru &amp; thru
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-05 18:12:00	Picture shows my tweet on 14th July &amp; tonight Ings is not in the squad &amp; the club say there is no news on him. Hhhmmm http://t.co/dDOHd9J488
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 18:45:12	I'm still raising money for the @SFC_Foundation by doing a skydive in Sept. Pls donate at http://t.co/u9Pm621n4A

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 19:45:59	really need to go and see the new Inbetweeners film pretty damn soon! I am not prepared to miss out on that one!

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:09:03	@JCSmiths nervous dont even cover it for me! Shaking when I was filling in the form haha

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:12:52	@lewpylew78 @JCSmiths glad to hear it 😀 I have done a bungee jump before so I am hoping the skydive will be better. Ppl say it is
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:15:47	@lewpylew78 @JCSmiths yes in Salisbury but that's as much as I know at the mo. Im sure we'll b looked after. Ppl must b scared all the time
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:17:55	@john_lush a Saints magazine/programme from Saturdays game wud be brill if u cud get me one. Will pay u back when I see u 👍😀😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:19:09	@JCSmiths raising the money has really given me a sense of achievement &amp; spurred me on. Will deffo b more signings, I don't doubt that
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:23:43	@JCSmiths gd 4 u. I'm sure he will b v proud. I havent been affected myself by cancer but as soon as I heard Saints Foundation I had 2 do it
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:24:47	@JCSmiths the club seem to be standing firm on Schneiderlin &amp; J Rod. Plus, J Rod is injured till Oct so deffo going nowhere! Lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:26:52	how is it only 9.30pm?!?! It feels like its about 1am #sleepy #tired #gettingold
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:39:05	@Saintsfan1978 @JCSmiths @SFC_Foundation thank you Terry. Very kind and thanks for your support :-) #saintsfc #skydive #scared
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:43:36	@Saintsfan1978 @JCSmiths @SFC_Foundation just happy 2 do the dive. It's the ppl who work 4 Foundation &amp; cancer charity who deserve credit
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:44:18	@Saintsfan1978 @JCSmiths @SFC_Foundation thanks for saying you will sponsor us too. You're a star!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:48:24	@Saintsfan1978 @JCSmiths @SFC_Foundation I live eat sleep &amp; breathe the football club; having the opportunity is fantastic! Next yr 4 u! Lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:50:10	@ITweetCrapDaily thanks for the RT for my skydive :-) much appreciated
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:54:43	@likeavillasboas @JCSmiths apparently the highest bid we have received is 10mill when others have gone 4 more its not enuf. Personally 1/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:55:26	@likeavillasboas @JCSmiths think he will go. Krueger said he will b at saints at start of season so can still leave end of aug 2/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:56:14	@JCSmiths @likeavillasboas J Rod is injured till October so earliest he will go is Jan, if he does
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 20:57:49	@JCSmiths @likeavillasboas schneiderlin isn't as replaceable as the rest IMO. Letting him go wud be criminal. Who knows what will happen!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 21:02:41	@likeavillasboas @JCSmiths that is true but I think Liverpool wud disagree there. Suarez wanted 2 leave last summer &amp; look at the season 1/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 21:03:20	@likeavillasboas he had last season. Get another decent year out of him wud be ok by me :-) signed a contract &amp; upto club what happens 2/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-07 22:21:19	feeling a lot like #saintsfc right now coz people keep underestimating me! 😀😀 
Do so at your own peril lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-08 08:23:40	who cares that it's Blackburn v Cardiff - tonight football is back bitches!!!!! #football #loveit #footballseason 😀😀⚽️⚽️😜😜❤️❤️⚽️⚽️😀😀

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-09 07:41:51	“@TransferScoop: Southampton bought...

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-09 09:18:42	@Monsterszinc we have replaced some of them already and the transfer window hasn't ended. Only one I am concerned about replacing now is CB
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-08 09:18:13	sod off Legia Warsaw!! plus Celtic were beaten 6-1 on aggregate &amp; the intelligible player played for 3 mins of the 180! Ur still not gd enuf
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-08 09:25:01	reinstating Celtic back into the Champions League is just delaying the inevitable surely. They will be in the Europa League soon enuf
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-08 09:36:33	@fizzer18 I'm raising money for Saints Foundation &amp; liver &amp; pancreas research charity doing a skydive. Auctioning this off wud b incredible
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-08 10:07:06	Legia Warsaw may have fielded 1 ineligible player 4 the Champs League but looking at the scoreline Celtic fielded 11 ineligible players! Lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-08 10:49:17	@mattletiss7 pls cud u DM me. I wud like to auction off a signed, Saints, football for the Saints Foundation in conjunction with my skydive

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-12 19:00:01	depression is a horrible thing &amp; is too often undetected.  Its sometimes the people that smile the hardest who r suffering the most #beaware
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-12 21:31:05	absolutely shattered and need a decent nights kip but too pissed off and wound up to sleep right now!! 😡😡
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-12 21:36:05	@Darrenwbee70 congrats on the win for brentford tonight. Looking like it was one to watch! lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-12 21:43:11	the ppl saying Shane Long 4 about 12 million is a rubbish signing r probably the same ppl that said Jay Rod wasn't worth 7 million #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-12 21:44:49	@Darrenwbee70 yeah good signing. 12 million cud sound a bit much but will prob fit into our team &amp; link up with Jay Rod very well #exciting
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-12 21:46:58	@chrisboalch had he not got injured last season he wud have been even more immense &amp; gone to Brazil. Has seen a massive rise at #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-12 21:48:12	@1984Saint he hasn't scored a massive amount of goals but causes defenders a lot of trouble &amp; think he will link up well with Jay Rod
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-12 21:49:12	@chrisboalch no he wudnt. Koeman has stood firm on him and Schneiderlin. Don't believe he wud have gone anywhere had he been fit
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-12 21:52:03	£55 away from my target of £1500 u amazing lot 😀 pls help me reach that by RTing my page http://t.co/u9Pm621n4A

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-12 21:53:15	@chrisboalch definately as lambert had no one to feed the ball to. This is where I think long cud help along with Pelle
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-12 21:55:43	@chrisboalch on SSN so has to be some truth in it. Need another CB or two though still. Need to announce this Gardos ASAP

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-09 21:17:28	heard a very small rumour that #saintsfc made a bid for Bony today. If that was true &amp; he signs, I wud have a proper OMFG moment! Lol 😜😁😀

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-18 17:55:49	@Si_mon_86 @cesc4official need goals from Fabregas and Costa tonight please :-) 
2nd in my league so come on boys #chelsea
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-18 18:04:17	@Si_mon_86 always Slow and steady wins the race and all that lol im sure u will be fine. I'm confusing the hell outta my neighbours! Hehe
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-18 18:12:35	@Si_mon_86 coz I'm cheering when players in my fantasy team score! I certainly don't support arsenal but Ramsey still got a whoop :-)
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-18 18:33:38	@Si_mon_86 it does a bit but I don't always like cheering on Chelsea and arsenal etc lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-18 18:53:38	Costa &amp; Fabregas scoring a couple each tonight wud be gd. Sorry Burnley coz always love an upset but fantasy football is at stake here! #MNF
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-18 19:17:01	good job I have no Chelsea defenders in my team! So pleased for Burnley but a long way to go so excited to see what will happen
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-18 19:17:56	GET IN COSTA!!! Great to see him get a goal &amp; my fantasy team is up and running tonight :-) #chelsea #fantasyfootball
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-18 19:22:07	Goal from costa and assist from Fabregas in 21 mins. My night is going pretty well so far :-)
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-18 19:32:39	Ref got that wrong in my opinion. It wasnt a dive coz he was clipped #chelsea #Burnley
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-18 19:36:11	another assist from Fabregas is points for me. Time for him to score a goal now and really get my points going :-)

Oh yeah....... It's bullshit
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-25 18:55:58	just need either Dzeko or Couthinho to score first tonight as I have placed a couple of cheeky bets :-) #MNF #neutral
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-24 02:01:01	Bank Holidays are definitely always fright nights!! Lol #town #nightout #IdiotOlympics
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-25 19:37:39	so glad I stayed in to watch the game tonight!!! Lol #MNF
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-25 19:44:52	“@mattletiss7: Nice assist by @DejanLovrenLFC6 bet he wishes his head wasnt at liverpool so early now 😃” fine words from a Saints legend :-)
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-25 19:48:30	great banter by @mattletiss7 &amp; what's even funnier are the Liverpool fans who don't get the joke! Haha :-) http://t.co/KxxfmanpIV
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-25 20:18:08	shit night for my fantasy football team. Time to slip down the table and look to bounce back next week :-) #fantasyfootball
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-25 20:32:38	Not been a gd night for Lovren. Is he going 2 get found out this season or prove he is worth 20million?!? Not a great start #saintsfc  #LFC
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-25 20:39:19	spending 20 million on Lovren and you're still losing 3-0 hahahaha

#banter
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-25 20:42:41	get in Lambert!! The only #saintsfc player to move to Liverpool with any class.
So happy for you #LFC
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-25 20:45:37	looks like Lambert is going to have to wait to be credited with his first Liverpool goal as its gone down as an own goal by Zabaleta #LFC
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-25 21:39:01	I hope Lovren likes Liverpool coz he may be there till the end of his contract now after that performance! #lovren #banter #PremierLeague

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-23 17:07:44	Saints need another striker IMO and I think that it shud be @IngsDanny 👍😀😀 #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-23 17:12:35	@ChrisMayhewSAS was really lacklustre performance today. No fight or passion. Wanyama MOTM &amp; Forster, Fonte &amp; Yoshida were decent #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-23 17:28:59	@ChrisMayhewSAS @BBCMOTD we deserve to be last tonight altho Villa v Newcastle was 0-0 too. No arguments from me on a poor game
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-23 17:30:35	@VectisEthaniel see some1 like ings fitting into our style of play, he's still young &amp; I think we are going to find it tough getting gr8 now
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-23 17:41:41	@ShaneLong7 can always hope that Villa v Newcastle is on last as it was also a 0-0 draw 😀😜😁 onwards &amp; upwards &amp; onto Millwall tues night
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-26 13:16:25	getting ready to go and watch @SouthamptonFC play @MillwallFC in the pouring rain, on a Tuesday night, is what us fans live for!! Hehe COYR

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-31 16:20:52	it appears that lying comes way too naturally for some people! 👩🔫
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-30 15:27:53	love 2 c someone comment negatively about @SchneiderlinMo4 commitment to @SouthamptonFC 
Great player who had moment of weakness #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-30 16:23:56	what a fine performance from @SouthamptonFC today. Controlled the game for most of it &amp; taught West Ham a footballing lesson #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-30 16:32:20	Yes Costa!!!! Great goal for my fantasy league and I believe an assist by fabregas which is even better 😀😀⚽️ #fantasyfootball
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-30 16:34:22	WOW!! 2 goals in two mins for Chelsea! #LookingGood #champions
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-30 17:06:51	I now have a spider loose in my kitchen after I found it in my pan &amp; shook it till the spider disappeared! Not so bright now! Haha 😁😁
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-01 16:35:46	“@sparkythebabler: This is to all the fans who doubted Krueger &amp; Reed, u all owe this club &amp; it's ownership an apology. #saintsfc” 100%!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-31 19:50:12	catching up on the xfactor and loving Andrea's first audition! Saw him at the arena one and thought he was better than that even ❤️
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-31 21:30:27	“@agentdion: Toby Alderweireld to Southampton is a #DoneDeal #saintsfc” let's hope so. Fingers crossed
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-31 21:36:22	@ShaunSadler exactly and koeman has always stood firm on them. Think spurs are forgetting that Jay Rod is injured! Haha won't pass medical
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-08-31 21:48:07	Been a long time coming that #saintsfc are to be involved in transfer deadline day drama. Sounds like we cud have 2-3 in tomoz #DeadlineDay

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-01 21:43:42	what's the betting that #saintsfc dont announce the new signings until tomoz?!? Just coz theres no news, doesnt mean the deals arent done
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-01 22:36:41	Sold Lovren to @LFC for 20 mill &amp; got @AlderweireldTob on season long loan from @Atleti with option to buy; fantastic business by #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-01 22:40:51	Option to buy clause on Alderweireld is 6.3 million which could turn out to be a frigging steal!! 😀😀 #saintsfc #SaintToby
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-01 22:51:07	“@SouthamptonFC: Fancy one last #deadlineday deal? #saintsfc http://t.co/9zowZXqoDx” it's coming............ 😀😀

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-01 23:38:37	Man Utd are still using Fergie time to wrap up the deal for Falcao i see 😂😳😂 #DeadlineDay

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-01 21:57:51	impressed with the signings that Hull have made on deadline day. Think they have done the best bit of business &amp; 1 to watch #hcafc

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-14 21:35:16	it appears that schneiderlin leaving was more about the ambition of the club than his desire 2 leave. Once the intent was shown he was happy
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-15 06:00:40	so pleased to read all about the demise at Newcastle rather than the actual match report between #saintsfc &amp; #nufc in the paper #sarcasm
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-15 06:22:09	@simon_leason tbh, Newcastle were shite which was highlighted more by how well saints played. This article went on about pardew/his job etc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-15 06:37:43	@simon_leason wudnt mind if we got a gd report but they don't seem interested in praising us ever. Will have to wen we finish top 6 :-) lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-15 21:57:10	@JoeCurtisx superman by eminem :-)
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-13 18:53:08	outstanding performance @SouthamptonFC 2day. were times when the football was just too damn sexy. We r more complete this season #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-13 19:11:34	@alancorky whats he being fed on?!? Lol no goals for 4 years &amp; 2 in a month. Loving the competition at Saints at the mo. we're looking slick
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-14 20:34:31	why do SO many men feel the need to lie about their relationship status?!? Do u think we are stupid &amp; are not going to find out?!? #overit
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-16 14:55:40	@steve_veho are there any deals at the boat show for the pebble? Looking to buy one there on Friday :-)
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-16 15:55:44	@steve_veho great; thanks. I will head over there Friday whilst on the premier marinas stand
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-16 18:38:04	@dexblackstock23 24 mins for first goal and Liverpool to win 3-1 #blackstockcomp
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-16 18:43:20	@dexblackstock23 sterling on 24 mins and Liverpool to win 3-1 #blackstockcomp
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-16 18:46:55	@dexblackstock23 not me!! They can score one goal coz I have gone for 3-1 to Liverpool
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-16 19:02:58	@ShaunSadler @dexblackstock23 have you not seen who theyre playing?!? Lol they shud be winning tonight; don't care who is playing; over it
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-16 19:12:34	@dexblackstock23 predict 0-0 so no Liverpool scorer :-) #blackstockcomp
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-16 19:13:39	lovren got away with that there!! Shud have been a penalty as no tempt to get the ball
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-16 19:17:32	@simon_leason really? I don't. The more I think about it &amp; the more i see him play the more I realise that he wasn't as gd as we all thought
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-16 19:25:57	think lallana's head must have been in Man City when he tried to score there! Haha :-)
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-09-16 19:26:58	Haha well done @Arsenal http://t.co/EPJIr2QjoM

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-05 13:47:23	was bound 2 happen. Had a feeling we wud concede 1st against spurs &amp; poss go on 2 lose the match. Whatever the result we will go marching on
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-05 22:08:46	@ObscureThing77 @charliewernham brilliant. Man of many talents then :-) lol

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-08 15:26:22	“@piersmorgan: Arsenal players have now suffered 889 injuries since 2002. Ridiculous. #afc” WOW!!!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-08 16:30:57	“@JakeQuickenden: Right let's do it follow spree follow me RT and #jakefollowme and I will do some 👍😉” RT #jakefollowme coming 2 show sat 😀

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-09 07:31:25	@jankluit @Veho *waiting in anticipation for the news of the prize* :-) :-)

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-09 13:10:02	@footballacca David Seaman. We did win 7-1 or something tho :-)
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-09 13:43:33	UEFA confirm Champions League seeding system will change next season #SSNHQ” @SouthamptonFC something we will b interested in nxt season :-)
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-09 13:59:31	@AndreaFaustini1 wud absolutely LOVE u to win the xfactor this yr. saw u in ur 1st audition &amp; u were amazing!! By far the best #Xfactor2014
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-09 18:40:33	fair play 2 Green 4 saying that about @Nathaniel_Clyne he shud b annoyed IMO. chambers was drafted in 4 an injury &amp; 2night perfect for clyne
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-09 18:52:46	doesn't matter how many decent England players there r in this country, we will never amount 2 anything coz of management &amp; higher #England
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-09 18:55:48	England team will never get picked on talent, just the team they play for. Our systems r all wrong over here &amp; they get it wrong every time
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-09 19:05:51	@simon_leason @Nathaniel_Clyne just embarrassing &amp; proves my point of Eng never winning anything when players r picked on team, not merit
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-10 14:14:58	how can I need more sleep already?!?! I slept for 9 hours last night and ready for a nap already! #sleepy #naptime

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-09 20:05:53	Lallana's first England goal, incorrectly, ruled out for offside. Having said that, he will score a better one soon I'm sure #deflection
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-09 20:10:48	find the fact that some ppl r getting personal towards Lallana after the goal was disallowed laughable really. He is playing for England!!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-09 20:15:10	@chelseehealey apparently so. A couple of cases and I think one is in Manchester but not sure about the other
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-09 20:16:24	Meanwhile............

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 16:33:31	@StevieJ73 @john_lush Sunderland were a car crash today. Thanks for making us first on @BBCMOTD for once tho :-) :-) #saintsfc #sunderland
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 16:45:10	@StevieJ73 @john_lush its the most bizarre own goal I have ever seen. Not sure what he was thinking there. I think I MAY watch MOTD
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 17:06:42	Gr8 day, gr8 performance and gr8 support #saintsfc #WeMarchOn http://t.co/PUsBu34Ern

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 17:17:08	@Darrenwbee70 it's the stuff dreams r made of with the scoreline. Will enjoy it today but wont get carried away coz next wk is another game
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 17:33:44	@john_lush @GaryLineker I've already heard shearer say that it's on first so fingers crossed :-)
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 17:38:40	Enough said! :-) #saintsfc http://t.co/xuZUv1jdrt
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 18:24:11	@Dicko240 @ATribbo @CarlTribbick @bubblybrooko unfortunately 4 Sunderland, we weren't our best 4 the whole game. We were gifted it in places
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 18:29:51	@Dicko240 @ATribbo @CarlTribbick @bubblybrooko thought the blue down the road were going 2 get promoted but not now. Always red &amp; white :-)
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 19:55:57	@bubblybrooko loving my new laptop and carry case :-) just got to wait 15 hrs for the latest iOS update on my phone now!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 20:17:25	@bubblybrooko it won't actually take that long as it never does but always starts off looking very bad
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 20:41:41	the look on ur face when ur team go down 8-0 😂😜😂 #saintsfc #sunderland http://t.co/Gd7AIsVchD

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 21:06:49	@BBCMOTD Southampton v Sunderland. Game of the day across all league and Europe surely?!? Hehe :-) #PremierLeague
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 21:07:58	@Monsterszinc @bubblybrooko oohh who is this annoying cow? I have to confess that I watch xfactor although it has been all football tonight
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 21:15:36	@Monsterszinc @bubblybrooko know exactly who u mean &amp; feel the same. She was booed in her audition &amp; it was made to look like she was liked
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 21:56:05	“@TinchyStryder: Southampton Passing game strong! #MOTD 😏” tinchy feeling the Southampton love :-) #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 22:01:33	one Spurs fan isn't happy! 😂😂 #MOTD http://t.co/96Aj9fsr7C
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 22:22:39	@SkyJohnnyP @mattletiss7 brilliant news! I know what I am doing after #MOTD this evening just gets better and better #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-18 22:25:19	my rose-tinted glasses &amp; disillusioned views r looking pretty gd. There is much more but here's a snippet #saintsfc http://t.co/2vkU3n2AVd
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 20:38:55	@ByTheMinSport seeing the smug look on @RonaldKoeman's face when Saints smashed 8 past Sunderland http://t.co/KpT9vMu1qo
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 08:36:32	@steve_veho 6th-8th. Predicted this in July and sticking to it :-) #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 08:41:20	@steve_veho yeah, it was b4 the players started leaving so I was questioned about it all the time &amp; stuck by it. Had belief in the club
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 08:47:38	@steve_veho happy to say that we are better off right now. Better players who want to play for the club under a great manager :-) #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 10:06:54	think it might be time to watch @SouthamptonFC win over @SunderlandAFC again as it has been an hr since I last watched the highlights 😀😜⚽️😜😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 10:17:07	Great stat &amp; know that our Saints boys are doing better but need to remember that Lallana was injured for 6 weeks http://t.co/LnhrhCMxHK
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 10:56:50	“@SunderlandAFC: O'Shea is looking to continue #SAFC's strong defensive record tomorrow: http://t.co/bup0zNgSft http://t.co/l15l4KV1yi” 😂😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-20 01:47:49	@jaybothroyd not a scapegoat at all altho agree with some of Redknapp's comments. QPR were MASSIVELY unlucky not 2 come away with 1/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-20 01:48:39	@jaybothroyd anything. Zamora has Lovren &amp; Skrtel in his back pocket &amp; QPR were unfortunate on silly own goals today 2/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-20 02:22:48	how the hell am I still awake?!?! It's going to be a LONG night!! 😩😞😷😴😷😪😰😤
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-20 02:23:59	@EmilyVanCamp what episode are they showing in America at the moment?!? I cannot wait for it to come back to the UK in the new year 😀😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-16 21:42:02	@SouthamptonFC I'm loving the new Qjacker app but how do I know if I am Itchen North or Itchen South being in block 7 as covered in both?
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-20 02:47:27	that's what I call a successful weekend on the telegraph fantasy football :-)
West Brom to beat Man Utd wud help 2 http://t.co/3k5TlLntvS
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-20 20:21:18	“@WBAFCofficial: Fellaini has now taken his tracksuit off, fortunately he has a Man Utd strip on underneath #WBAMUN” haha #awkward
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-20 20:23:49	Glad to see that Berahino is, currently, sparing my blushes and not letting Fellaini have the leveller :-) hehe
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-20 20:25:58	@saintant it was a fantastic finish. Utd's defending is poor at times. Luke Shaw has looked average at best tonight
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-20 20:45:26	a draw is not a bad result for #saintsfc in the grand scheme of things and we have seen some good goals tonight :-) #WBAvMUFC
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 12:22:13	don't think #QPR will be an easy game for #LFC today but think Liverpool will come away victorious #SuperSunday
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 12:36:16	@ByTheMinSport and he get called up to the England squad ahead of Clyne! Go figure! Lol #bigclublogic
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 12:40:00	great play from Austin there to go past two defenders and create a great chance for QPR #QPRvLIV
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 12:44:16	was gr8 to see @1jamesbeattie at the @SouthamptonFC game yesterday. Once a saint, always a Saint :-) #saintsfc #oneteaminhampshire
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 12:51:50	wrong decision from the linesman there as Henderson was onside. Prob a big let off for QPR #QPRvLIV
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 12:58:45	Leroy Fer!!!!! Should not have missed that. Should have been an easy 1-0 to QPR there #QPRvLIV
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 13:04:41	frigging hell QPR!! How are you not scoring. Beating Liverpool all over the pitch at the moment but being unlucky in their chances #QPRvLIV
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 13:06:38	#LFC are currently being played off the pitch by #QPR and their next game is Real Madrid...........
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 13:29:49	Lovren and Skrtel made Zamora look like Ronaldo in that first half #QPRvLIV
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 13:34:37	QPR starting the second half as they finished the first and Liverpool are still firing ridiculously wide! #QPRvLIV
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 13:37:17	Balotelli looks completely disinterested in this game today. Not a guy you want on the pitch when in that kind of mood #lfc #noeffect
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 13:42:20	Crazy game today!! i am finding myself cheering on QPR which never happens lol #QPRvLIV
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 13:50:02	Criminal effort by balotelli there!! Liverpool are starting to turn the screw and get into the game. QPR with less chances in last 5mins
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 13:54:54	it was only a matter of time before Liverpool were going to go ahead. Worse luck its an own goal but QPR needed to take their chances
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 14:14:05	I actually cheered when that QPR goal went in!! Nothing more than they have deserved today in the grand scheme of things #QPRvLIV
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 14:19:36	Hahaha what a fantastic end to this game!! A 2-2 draw wud be the fairest result. QPR have put in a proper shift today #QPRvLIV
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 14:22:27	Bloody hell!! This is why I LOVE the premier league. There have been some cracking games this wkend altho nothing will beat #saintsfc win
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-19 14:41:48	looking for a clean sheet from #Stoke today as I need to build up my points in my fantasy team :-) #shawcross #FantasyFootball

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-20 20:09:49	@mattletiss7 @RedDevil1952 looks like someone didn't detect the sarcasm considering Moses' "dive" yesterday lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-20 20:12:50	@ChrisMayhewSAS maybe the injury affected him? He was overweight when he turned up &amp; perhaps he's struggled since

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-26 17:57:11	good result for @SouthamptonFC fans with Chelsea and Utd drawing. Utd stay way behind and Chelsea aren't too far ahead 👍😀😜😀 #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-26 18:34:08	just watching @BBCMOTD now and WTF was Dawson doing in the box in the #WBA v #PAL game?? Shocking foul with the elbow to face!! #dirty
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-26 19:08:01	@ellison_tate @midlandsfooty @BBCMOTD went flying in, he lead with his elbow and caught Speroni in the face; complete foul.
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-26 20:37:36	@ellison_tate @midlandsfooty @BBCMOTD he wasnt jumping for height at that point. Elbows are given as fouls all over the pitch all the time
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-26 20:39:50	wud like a poll of who thought Dawson fouled Speroni yesterday and would didnt. 
RT for yes
FAV for no
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-26 20:55:09	@ellison_tate @midlandsfooty @BBCMOTD never said he did it intentionally just don't think he needed 2 smash in with elbow. Ppl make mistakes
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-26 21:09:04	https://t.co/gD1BePzVh7 @ellison_tate 
Here's the 2 fouls that Dawson committed being shown on @BBCMOTD last night. Not malicious but a foul
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-26 21:38:52	@ellison_tate @BBCMOTD definitely a yellow &amp; on another day both wud have been a yellow &amp; then he wud be sent off. Football is inconsistent
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-26 22:53:48	@Carra23 do u think the Drogba goal is a Van Persie own goal? Mane's was taken away from him last wk &amp; today was definitely an own goal
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-10-26 23:39:41	This is fab! I want one lol 😀❤️😀 #saintsfc #xmaspresent #prettyplease http://t.co/43FFsE5bC9

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 15:03:20	“@leesiemaszko: Great composure from @DejanLovrenLFC6 #Not #Shite” 😳😳😳
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 16:27:42	@ArgosHelpers 7am Monday morning as I have been waiting over a week for delivery now &amp; spent too much time chasing everything up already
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 16:47:53	@Dydo137 @ArgosHelpers @YodelOnline not impressed that I am being asked wen I wud like it 2 be delivered when it is already over a wk late!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 16:48:59	@Dydo137 @ArgosHelpers @YodelOnline being delivered to work &amp; always some1 there. It shud be out to me 1st thing tomorrow without question
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 16:56:39	@ArgosHelpers I have after lots of time on the Internet found somewhere else that sells my item and, therefore, if it is not delivered 1/3
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 16:57:16	@ArgosHelpers before the end of the day tomorrow, I will be cancelling my order, getting a full refund as well as compensation for my 2/3
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 16:59:33	@ArgosHelpers phone bills etc when Ive had 2 chase it up &amp; find out what is going on. whole thing has been a disaster from start 2 finish
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 17:13:18	@Dydo137 @ArgosHelpers @YodelOnline have decided that I will b cancelling my order with Argos &amp; ordering item elsewhere. Full refund 1/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 17:14:04	@Dydo137 @ArgosHelpers @YodelOnline &amp; compensation for phone bills etc. will never EVER b using yodel again or any company that uses them
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 17:16:21	@Dydo137 @ArgosHelpers @YodelOnline I would have done it a long time ago but only just found somewhere else with the same item so was stuck!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 17:20:19	@Dydo137 @ArgosHelpers @YodelOnline @CEOemail thank you. I will do. Tbh I don't really see either of them doing anything as they haven't 1/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 17:21:02	@Dydo137 @ArgosHelpers @YodelOnline @CEOemail seemed to care so far &amp; blaming everything on Black Friday wkend! I will get what is owed tho
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 17:28:33	@BHS_UK please could you confirm which company you use for your delivery services?? Would like to know before anything is ordered. Thanks

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 19:52:24	@ArgosHelpers thanks 4 ur response. How does it work if I ask u to cancel it on here? When is the refund processed etc? Shud I phone tomoz?
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 19:55:53	@ArgosHelpers also the CEO of @YodelOnline was on tv the other day saying every1 who had ordered wud have theirs by the end of the wkend 1/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 19:56:49	@ArgosHelpers so don't see how they now don't know when it will be delivered. Been sat in their Southampton depot since 6th Dec 2/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-14 20:15:09	@ArgosHelpers thank you Chris. I shall look out for it over the coming days
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-15 07:11:51	@BHS_UK thanks for coming back to me. I presume that yodel are not involved if I opt for click &amp; collect rather than delivery?
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-17 02:48:13	as if the defeat to Sheff Utd wasnt bad enuf, the players didnt have the decency to come over &amp; applaud the 4000 fans who made the trip 1/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-17 02:49:41	bar @ShaneLong7 &amp; Jose Fonte who did his best to get them over. Terrible treatment for us #saintsfc fans tonight
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-17 03:05:00	@nico_caltabiano I hope they will &amp; they shud! Fonte tried to call some over but the likes of @Nathaniel_Clyne etc ignored it &amp; walked off
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-17 09:35:01	@stevepatton1967 long came over, Fonte did &amp; Fonte tried to get others over, gestured to them they needed to &amp; was ignored by most
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-17 10:06:52	@stevepatton1967 there there certainly were some idiots abusing the players at the end &amp; I know ppl r angry but it doesn't help things
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-17 11:42:24	Thanks 4 ur words @Mattytargett 👏 it wud have been nice if the players came over &amp; applauded us last night after the game. Was hard to take
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2014-12-18 09:19:26	Sterling scores 2 goals against bournemouth last night and Brendan Rodgers compares him to Sanchez! Haha 😂 #liverpoollogic #banter

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-01-15 21:56:24	SO jealous of the #saintsfc fans heading to #NUFC this weekend. Damn work has got in the way so thank god for @SkyFootball &amp; a late KO
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-01-16 21:17:10	@Darrenwbee70 I can't remember the channel Darren but u can only get it on freeview or virgin. If u do a channel search at that's Solent tv
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-01-16 21:23:45	@Darrenwbee70 please don't! Haha 😂😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-01-17 22:21:05	tomorrow I will be a #MCFC fan. Let them &amp; #CFC storm the league &amp; keep everyone else comfortably behind us 👍⚽️⚽️ #saintsfc #WeMarchOn

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-01-17 19:24:06	Elia makes sure the saints go marching on on on! The tiredness showed in parts today but a trio of difficult away wins complete! #saintsfc

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-01-17 20:14:23	I am, literally, in love with @RonaldKoeman &amp; @SouthamptonFC right now ❤️❤️ proud doesn't come close to how I'm feeling #saintsfc #WeMarchOn
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-01-17 20:58:22	“@AlderweireldTob: U have to fight trough the bad days in order to earn the best days💪✌️ http://t.co/jxX54gIoJv” awesome tweet ❤️ #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-01-17 18:05:52	unlucky goal for #saintsfc there. Shud Forster have called it or did he &amp; wasn't heard?!? Can't blame Gardos for the rebound on Gouffran
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-01-17 18:54:48	@ELJERO11ELIA has been the best player on the pitch today so far. Not only got the goals but put in a good shift #saintsfc #WeMarchOn
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-01-17 19:26:39	im just going to put it out there now. 
I think @SouthamptonFC are staying up.............. lol #saintsfc #WeMarchOn
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-01-17 20:09:55	@ShaneLong7 @ELJERO11ELIA another great shift put in by you tonight Long. Always work your arse off &amp; don't always get the credit #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-01-18 07:50:46	@bigadamsport agreed. I think Shane long shud have had, at least, 3 in the last few months. It swings &amp; roundabouts but Koeman stays classy
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-01-19 08:15:13	#afc beat #MCFC with a similar game plan to #saintsfc when they beat #MUFC but u wudnt have thought it listening 2 the analysis! #logic

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-01-29 18:18:20	@saintliana I don't know how much is the club and how much is the players. Koeman always said things will be dealt with in the summer

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 18:41:58	@john_lush i need to see the sending off again coz from where I was sitting he got the ball. Saints shud contest the red for sure
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 18:44:33	Hahahahaha 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 have just seen a replay of the @ryanbertrand3 sending off &amp; it is never a red card. Yellow at most so need to contest it
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 19:02:34	Errrrr no! Lol http://t.co/mddXVhRtUO
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 19:24:08	@dbailey11 having watched it at home just to clarify my thoughts on it, I wud say absolutely not a red card.
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 19:26:36	@dbailey11 it was a yellow at most &amp; glad to hear we are going to appeal it. don't think we will get it back either with the injury as well
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 19:29:57	Haha what a twat! 😂😂 #selfie #fail http://t.co/KfBJwe3obe
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 19:43:12	@Dydo137 haha it so is 👍😜😜 xx
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 20:20:17	@EmmaEFarmer @saintliana @SimonPeach has reported that he is fine
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 20:21:47	@EmmaEFarmer @saintliana @SimonPeach possibly and Bertrand wasn't going to get sent of until Monk shouted at him &amp; swayed his decision!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 20:22:19	@EmmaEFarmer @saintliana @SimonPeach I hope he remembers that next time a decision doesn't go his way. One of the first to criticise!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 20:23:27	@shaunlovelock this is nothing new Shaun. "Fans" walk out early whatever the score. There were some that did in the 8-0 win over Sunderland
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 20:25:17	@shaunlovelock I know! It is ridiculous. Ppl moan about the price of football tickets &amp; then don't stay until the end. Make ur mind up! Lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 21:00:52	hurry up May coz then it will b sunshine, holiday, #saintsfc player awards dinner, hospitality for Villa game, Boyz II Men concert etc 🎉❤️🎉
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 21:03:01	@shaunlovelock I wud swap Toby in 4 yoshida to start &amp; then look at changing it around in the 2nd half with Toby at LB &amp; bring a forward on
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 21:04:06	@shaunlovelock prob start will Elia instead of Davis too as Morgan and Wanyama give the back for enough protection with others on the wings
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 21:08:14	@shaunlovelock Reed was my MOTM today. We need some1 else to come in at Pelle's position too in case he gets injured. New signing on its way
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 21:18:45	Spot the mistake on this email haha 😂😂😂 #spelling #epicfail http://t.co/LnXsNqyP2V
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-02 19:53:45	#saintsfc have signed another player that I am going 2 have 2 call by their 1st name as can't pronounce their surname! Haha 😂 welcome Filip
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 21:50:03	@Monsterszinc I ALWAYS proof read this word at work coz Im really conscious of doing it. Did make me lol coz that will go to thousands!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 21:51:49	@bbc606 @IanWright0 same as Ian's BUT I, also, think it cud be Villa instead of Hull. QPR &amp; Leicester definitely down
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-01 22:07:01	@Monsterszinc already done. Have told them how highly offensive the email is! Lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-02 22:33:38	Tweet of the night goes to this man. One of the Middlesbrough players that played when they knocked city out the cup http://t.co/TSQv7xNmrl

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-04 21:52:39	@Benalisbigrun when do the tickets get sent out for the gala dinner?? Do they get sent out as soon as money is received?
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-05 07:49:48	Hahaha jealousy and bitterness is not a good look on you Pochettino! 😂😂 #saintsfc

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-08 18:09:42	only time I have EVER wanted West Ham to win, they let me down. However a draw with Man Utd isn't the end of the world for #saintsfc fans
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-08 18:14:44	@simonrichards yeah let's hope so and hope their injured players don't come back for Wednesday night 😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-08 18:23:03	Goodo! This could help #saintsfc on Wednesday night #WeMarchOn http://t.co/eJxAqPl8qa

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-19 20:27:49	Still don't think it is as simple as Jane killing Lucy. Someone else like Cindy or Bobby was involved and Jane is covering/helped #EELive
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-19 20:32:22	@parttimesoldier if that was it, it wud be a bit of a let down. Still don't reckon she killed her &amp; she's covering/helped Bobby or Cindy
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-19 20:34:33	@EmmaEFarmer not the end of it tho. Don't actually think it was Jane. She has helped/covering for someone. All will be revealed at 9.25 :-)

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-22 11:18:09	@Benalisbigrun @barryt1963 thanks. All sorted yesterday with Lisa Caitlin and 3 of us coming now 👍
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-22 12:27:11	come on West Ham! That's what we like to see; doing #saintsfc a favour 👍
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-22 22:06:59	@steve_veho ref was absolutely shocking &amp; completely bottled decisions but we still need to start scoring @ home again. 3 games &amp; no goals 😳
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-22 23:55:44	beginning to forget what this thing called sleep is 😡😡 about 4 hours sleep the last two nights and I am still awake now!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-24 08:52:18	@yarnsbaby @saintliana I definitely wouldn't share this with anyone. It's been horrible xx
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-23 01:11:37	just want the pain to stop now 👊
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-22 17:54:23	all of today's events are irrelevant as, worryingly, Saints are not scoring at home. Three games in a row after today 😁😁 #saintsfc

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-23 15:31:23	if any1 is confused bout the FA not taking action against Barnes, it's coz the ref saw it &amp; wrote about it in his report. Cannot take action
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-23 15:54:20	@granthale01 not at all. The 1st one was referring to the FA not taking action on Barnes &amp; the 2nd to Allardyce about his unjustified rants
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-23 16:01:25	@granthale01 yeah but not the game you are trying to refer to; I know your game haha 😝

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-23 15:19:49	@bigadamsport they cannot take action as it was seen by the ref &amp; written in his report. That's the rulings with it unfortunately
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-23 15:38:37	message for Allardyce, the extra time given is the MINIMUM number of minutes given &amp; not the exact. Other things occur &amp; can be longer 👍

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-27 18:43:03	@saintliana ah ok. think something may have happened. Some1 has tweeted about what a bellend he is. Wants him dropped for the rest of season
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-27 18:44:53	anyone know what Nathaniel Clyne is supposed to have done today?!? #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-27 18:47:31	@DTibot someone has tweeted they want him dropped for rest of season &amp; he's a bellend! He must have done something
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-27 18:50:17	@saintliana oh well. If he goes, he goes. He was one I have always thought wud move on &amp; used us as a stepping stone from the moment he came
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-27 18:51:36	@bswatridge thanks for that. Happy to let him go. Always thought he used us as a stepping stone from the moment he came anyway
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-27 18:52:45	@saintliana yeah deffo. Hopefully too many people haven't seen it. Don't need more unrest between everyone. Why can't players stay classy?
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-27 18:56:42	@bswatridge unfortunately when money is involved, ppl tend 2 act like dicks. Hopefully that is the last of it. No player is bigger than club
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-27 19:11:07	@Si_mon_86 @Nathaniel_Clyne apparently he RT something about Chelsea and arsenal battling for him &amp; then delete. Let's see what happens 1st
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-27 19:14:56	@Si_mon_86 @Nathaniel_Clyne yeah definitely. Who knows what is happening but ppl need to learn to wait &amp; listen to the truth on the website
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-27 19:20:05	@Si_mon_86 @Nathaniel_Clyne 100% wud be v sad if he left but players can/do move on. Whatever will be will be. We support a team #saintsfc

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-02-26 01:36:55	@john_lush they stuffed up my acca too! All the others, so far, have come in. If the ones tomoz do too, they have cost me around 80,000! 👊

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-04 23:51:39	@Southamptonmark think we may just get into Europe. I predicted 6th-8th at the start of the season and think it will be about right
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-05 10:35:07	@Southamptonmark possibly spurs but we won't be above Liverpool I don't think
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-05 12:52:11	£3 entry to watch the #saintsfc under 21s play tonight; I am tempted. What do you reckon @Dydo137 &amp; @Kazz1979Karen if you're not working it?

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-11 22:19:23	great night of football for #saintsfc fans. Chelsea have been put through 120 mins &amp; looked lethargic at times; right before we play them 👍

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-21 17:00:36	K Davis may be 38 &amp; not have played for over a yr but what great saves he made either side of @ShaneLong7 goal to help #saintsfc to victory
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-21 17:08:25	@BBCSport 2-0 it finished 😳😂😳😂
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-21 17:10:08	@steve_veho its Kelvin lol 😂😳😂 
Deffo the two Davis men for men of the match #WeMarchOn
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-21 17:26:05	hearing that @FraserForster injury cud be ACL or knee ligament which cud mean a lengthy spell on the sidelines 👎😞😞 #fingerscrossed #saintsfc
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-21 17:46:07	@ChrisMayhewSAS its a possibility. Great saves by Kelvin today tho
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-21 18:13:59	Enough said hehehe 👍 #saintsfc #kelvindavis http://t.co/WXKRlct75j
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-21 18:27:06	Sky say it was a disappointing first half. You air West Ham v Sunderland!! Eerrr hello?!?!? Hardly surprising 😂😂 #skysports
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-21 18:29:01	West Ham have not won in about 8 games and Sunderland are, well, Sunderland. 
Fingers crossed for the 2nd half coz passing has been woeful
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-21 18:56:33	neither Sunderland or West Ham have registered a shot on target the last 35 mins. Perfect example of why the Premier League isn't the best
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-22 17:00:04	Think I may put a cheeky little bet on @ManUtd winning the title this season 👍😀😀 #footballbets #ManUtd

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-25 21:41:09	absolutely gutted for @FraserForster after hearing the news. To be out for 6-12 months is heartbreaking for us all 😢😢😟😟 #saintsfc #injury
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-26 12:06:26	whoever has started the #CuttingForZayn trend needs to take a hard look at themselves. You shud NEVER encourage kids to cut themselves!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-26 12:24:58	@piersmorgan @dankthemanc funny you say that because so did Piers. That's actually what he said!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-26 12:38:56	WOW! General tickets for the @england game have sold out ⚽️⚽️ glad we made our last minute decision on Sunday @Kazz1979Karen #cantwait
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-26 12:48:05	@EssexPR if it was depression that took over, he won't have understood it himself. Not saying it's right by any means but he may have 1/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-26 12:49:11	@EssexPR thought that it was his only way out. When depression takes over, life can feel worthless. SO sad that he took others with him tho
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-26 13:05:25	@flowinfootball @EssexPR depression can take over ur whole life &amp; It is not as black &amp; white as being selfish unfortunately
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-26 13:27:42	@flowinfootball @EssexPR it is sad &amp; there is not enough of the right help out there for ppl going thru it. Too many ppl incorrectly judge
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-26 14:39:15	Kenwyne Jones is heading back to the south! It's like he is on his way to @afcbournemouth #saintsfc

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-26 17:27:35	angry at the ppl moaning about the traffic &amp; slagging bad drivers after the crash on the #m27 today. Some1 lost their life! #perspective
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-26 17:28:29	There is also a 19 month old baby critical in hospital. Yes taking 5 hrs to get home is frustrating but I think ur day is still better! #m27
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-26 19:01:53	@shaunlovelock is the traffic still really bad?? I need to go from Sholing to bursledon and thinking I shud be ok about 9pm

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-26 19:08:55	@ShaunSadler I'm glad to hear that. One life has already been lost 😟
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-27 06:59:50	@saintliana @premierleague I thought exactly the same last night. Kane's was more of a deflection and less likely to be a goal without it
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-03-27 07:21:11	this arrived yesterday @CalumBest &amp; I can't wait to start ready it. A beautiful, fine gentleman you have turned into http://t.co/WFRk3P8jbQ

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-04-03 23:45:50	@SaintsFansFC its seemed only right to swap Forster and Davis. He was excellent against Burnely &amp; so cheap on fantasy football too!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-04-03 23:46:20	@SaintsFansFC plus he has the saints defence in front of him so will be a good test for them too and see how good they really are 😃👍

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-05-11 21:31:19	@bigadamsport shame. Think we r gonna have to have Davis back in goal for the game. See why he was trialling Gazzaniga but too important now
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-05-11 23:30:04	@SouthamptonFC it has just occurred to me that I have not received the hospitality tickets I have booked in the Terry Paine suite for 1/2

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-05-30 17:17:11	personally I cant understand the #saintsfc supporters who don't want Europe. not just about playing thurs nights, it's WAY more than that ⚽️
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-05-30 17:20:31	@ShaunSadler exactly. European footy, attract better players, encourage the team to be the best they can &amp; raise the profile of the club
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-05-30 17:25:51	@LegohairHead @ShaunSadler teams like Everton, Spurs &amp; Stoke have all finished mid table or better when in Europe. For a team looking to 1/2
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-05-30 17:26:28	@LegohairHead @ShaunSadler progress, Euro football is the next stage. We shud want to test ourselves in that. We will build a bigger squad
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-05-30 17:27:32	@mattletiss7 I am Matt. Looking forward to it as well as raising money for charity. See u there! 😀😀
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-05-30 17:28:59	@LegohairHead but that's other teams. If there is 1 thing we have shown every1 over the yrs is that we don't conform. We make it our own way
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-05-30 17:46:49	Just a few words @SouthamptonFC @RonaldKoeman it may be by default but what a great achievement by all #saintsfc http://t.co/1HqZ3oKFlt

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-07 15:50:35	Pretty much sums up how I'm feeling today #tired #sleep #hungover #fragile #feedme http://t.co/p0kVYkwfD5
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-07 18:47:41	in the tune 2 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight' 
get this trending 2 be sung nxt season round St Mary's #saintsfc #WeMarchOn http://t.co/i10C2PsVI6
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-07 18:49:05	@bubblybrooko hahaha yeah something like that I think. I was very happy drunk last night but can't say the same today 😁🙈
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-07 18:55:46	@cj_garrett I was at City game and I don't remember it being sung. Ooopppppps 😳 hehe
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-07 18:58:07	@cj_garrett fair enough. Let's get it sung at St Mary's more often then; I like the song
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-07 01:11:15	pissed or pissed off; I can't decide 😁😁
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-07 18:59:37	@kwilsonnnnn so I have been told. I was at City away as well and don't remember hearing it or singing it. Good one for St Mary's nxt season
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-07 19:00:20	@cj_garrett yeah he will be. It looks as though what he said was twisted &amp; made out like he wants to move to arsenal now
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-07 01:46:14	@SArmstrong58 not sure that I want to mention it on here really. Tonight 4 people have believed someone about me that is really untrue!! 😞
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-07 01:55:37	@SArmstrong58 mates told ppl that I was a prostitute &amp; did it 4 drug money in some cases &amp; ppl believed it! Not the confidence boost needed
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-07 02:05:30	@SArmstrong58 well we were in a gay bar and it was 1 women and 3 blokes. Might as well give up now! 😥😥 lol

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-07 02:13:04	I'm just gonna give up now!! 😩😩😩

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-09 18:48:46	Fleetwood Mac have cancelled a gig in Birmingham tonight due to illness. They had best not miss the @IsleOfWightFest @JohnGiddings01 😭😞😭😞😢

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-11 16:17:37	@ShaunSadler @IsleOfWightFest quite possibly but all part of the experience I guess! Putting the tent up in the rain cud be fun/interesting
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-10 21:09:30	Expecting 2 see Harry reprimanded by @bbuk in tonights episode as her threats 2 Marc were disgusting. Threatening violent behaviour 😡😡
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-10 21:12:22	don't get me wrong, Marc is not innocent &amp; is a complete prat most of the time but threatening him like that is not right @bbuk
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-10 21:14:27	if a bloke threatened a girl, ppl wud be all over it. shudnt be treated diff coz she is a girl. Ppl have been told off 4 less as well @bbuk
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-12 07:16:59	@ben_vallance thanks Ben. I had best change a few things up then!
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-12 00:03:13	q for all @IsleOfWightFest goers. Are cans of drinks/red bull allowed into campsite or do they have to be in plastic too? @JohnGiddings01
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-15 07:48:05	thanx 2 the lovely @AGT79 4 donating these football prints 4 me 2 auction off 4 #charity #saintsfc #Spurs #MCFC #CFC http://t.co/YBYPy7SzEQ

454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-17 22:59:20	sometimes the ppl with the biggest smiles &amp; the loudest laughs r the people who r hurting the most inside. Look after those around you 👌🏼
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-18 08:47:15	@shaunlovelock true &amp; u never know, we may keep both. Need to build &amp; strengthen our squad for Europe &amp; stranger things have happened lol
454023220	ShonaSaintsB	2015-06-18 08:10:53	@shaunlovelock unfortunately I don't think he would sit on the bench at Liverpool. I think he would be their first choice RB
