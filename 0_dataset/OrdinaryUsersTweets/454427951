454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-09 13:42:09	@nutjob @fxnopinion Perhaps BO's thinking that somehow Crusades will shame Christians into not pushing back against islamic invasion again.

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 13:43:16	@BradThor @jjauthor Kanye seems to be thirsting for attention. Poor baby, lost his pacifier.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 13:44:22	@48HDpanhead @BradThor She HAS to say that or he'll have a tantrum.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 13:48:54	Hearing that Kanye acts like a big loser, reaffirms my reasons why not to watch award shows like #Grammys2015
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 13:53:29	@AnnemarieWeers Read the caption! The point of it all is Mooche's overreach into other children's lunches vs her own. Did u miss that?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 13:55:51	@AnnemarieWeers But seeing you're a lib, you must like ppl telling how to live &amp; how 2 raise ur kids. Yes, I am Christian, not a sheep.

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:06:00	@AnnemarieWeers @mimimayesTN Explain Pro-choice, please.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:11:22	@AnnemarieWeers @Fairfax51 @mimimayesTN MOST abortions are NOT about health. It's about killing God's creation..cuz 1 made a dumb decision?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:16:22	@AnnemarieWeers @mimimayesTN You're not really a Catholic! Don't EVER question MY faith when urs (NOT Catholic!!) supports killing a human.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:18:45	@AnnemarieWeers @Fairfax51 @mimimayesTN Men don't have the privilege and responsibility of carrying a child inside them. Not the same rules.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:20:30	@AnnemarieWeers @Fairfax51 @mimimayesTN If they could, I could see the unfairness you experience. But God created ppl as is for a reason.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:23:21	@Fairfax51 @AnnemarieWeers @mimimayesTN No excuses.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:28:06	@Fairfax51 @AnnemarieWeers @mimimayesTN Exactly! Kept out of the "choice".
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:31:44	@Fairfax51 @AnnemarieWeers @mimimayesTN If she loves her life, I wonder if she feels ashamed of her selfishness while others don't get life.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:34:19	@mimimayesTN @Fairfax51 @AnnemarieWeers and that "it" feels no pain while being torn to pieces...
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:42:03	@mimimayesTN @Fairfax51 @AnnemarieWeers A college friend, long ago, dragged me to watch abortion video. I've never felt so sick afterward.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:43:23	@mimimayesTN @Fairfax51 @AnnemarieWeers I knew learned never to be in such a situation where a baby was unwanted. Just not right!!
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:46:40	@thetrueoorah Of course they should!!! It is common sense that it should be illegal and punishable. WTH??
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:50:14	@Fairfax51 @mimimayesTN @AnnemarieWeers So very sad. It must feel like such a load when it dawns on you what was done. Very sad.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:52:18	@Fairfax51 @mimimayesTN @AnnemarieWeers Because abstinence is for "losers". They NEED to see a video. Barbaric, but real.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:55:59	@Fairfax51 @mimimayesTN @AnnemarieWeers the consequences are SO much greater than one ever believes or understands. &amp; u want to talk health?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:56:28	@Fairfax51 @mimimayesTN @AnnemarieWeers The consequences are both physical AND mental/emotional.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 14:58:16	@mimimayesTN @Fairfax51 @AnnemarieWeers For sure! What a difficult position to be in.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 15:02:50	@Fairfax51 @mimimayesTN That's where educating our youth has gone down the deep end. Planned Parenthood's profits rely on miseducated kids.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 15:06:23	@michaelscherer @yidwithlid LOL! He even lies about his expertise in lying!!!
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 15:14:01	@Fairfax51 @mimimayesTN I can totally see how that impacts your life. Children are a blessing. &amp; when you're mature enough 2see that-WOW!
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 15:15:42	@Fairfax51 @mimimayesTN ...if or when you miss your "window" - it can't be easy to cope
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 15:24:06	@Fairfax51 @mimimayesTN even worse! I've a friend who was told she needed hysterectomy. Turns out, such drastic measures weren't necessary..
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 15:25:38	@Fairfax51 @mimimayesTN She's been lamenting about being forced to never being able@to conceive ever since.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 15:26:53	@Fairfax51 @mimimayesTN No. Sorry. I meant the botched abortion is even worse. Threw in an ex of not being able 2 conceive for other reason.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 15:28:46	@Fairfax51 @mimimayesTN Agreed
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 15:31:01	@Fairfax51 @mimimayesTN Great chatting. Take care.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 15:37:36	@FoxNews But...."global warming" is bearing down on us. How can this be happening?!?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 15:40:39	@vicanbi @Jenevalynne Of course BO will "bring them to justice". Just like the released Gitmo detainees... Daesh!!
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-12 15:57:04	@chicagotribune What relevance does his opinion about the concept of evolution have to his running for president? It's merely a worldview.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-12 16:17:56	@liberteanow Tried 2listen 2ur 1st podcast but kept jumping back 2beginning. Don't know if it's my end or yours causing it. Best of luck 2u
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-12 16:32:10	@EdBaker3000 @rodsandguitars Pretty sure they won't find any antiAmerican, prosocialist, promudslime leanings. In fact, I'll bet on it!!!
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-12 16:34:34	@EdBaker3000 @rodsandguitars They may even find that his name IS, in fact, Scott Walker.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-12 16:38:44	@ChuckNellis @TamraTellsIt Srry 2butt in,but wouldn't changing standards(getting rid of CC) automatically maketests supportingit irrelevant?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 15:51:59	@davidwebbshow @toddstarnes Agreed!!
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 15:55:01	@DailyCaller Kill the program - pack lunches from home.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 16:10:53	@Males_Thoughts The first time I heard of Kanye was of his jealous tantrum with Taylor Swift. Is that his signature talent?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-12 16:42:07	@benshapiro Amen!!
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-12 16:43:36	@ChuckNellis @TamraTellsIt The bigger problem of the two is CC. The rest nicely falls into place.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-12 16:59:47	@TamraTellsIt @ChuckNellis But, if they fail (hopefully..), then something must be done-rewrite test 2follow the newly prescribed standards.

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-10 17:16:08	@TXhighplains @theblaze And BO would love for us to take this sitting down, because...ya know, Crusades.

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-27 15:48:56	@LadykKatie It can go either way, depending on parents' attitude toward that work ethic and education.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-27 15:53:34	@LadykKatie "You" can be used as a general term. You (in this case you, literally) don't have to be defensive. I'm not "attacking" you.

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-02-27 15:59:47	@LadykKatie The bigger issue is the uneducated parents who need to get to work and get off welfare. Welfare is meant to be temporary.

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-12 03:25:15	@ChuckNellis @LJSpagnoli just not for the illegals who want to kill us..
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-12 03:01:29	@tjemery1 simple solution, instead of a family room, make one for transgender, confused, messed up room. Give them their own locker room.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-12 20:10:44	@1John534 @GeneLingerfelt I'm a big Bob Marley fan. I don't recall a song called "Don't Worry, Be Happy" being his. U thinking Mcferrin?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-12 16:26:56	@LearnOurHistory Can you share it NOT through FB? Would love to see it, but not on FB. Thanks.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-13 12:48:50	@ericbolling @ChristiChat Time to defund a bunch of govt agencies. Let's start w/IRS, EPA, &amp;DofEd.Also get rid of UN-nothing but a nuisance.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-12 20:25:43	@PioneerBoston @michellemalkin when u change history&amp;make learners ignorant of its truth, then all things r possible-esp control of populace

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-12 20:41:40	@1John534 In case you didn't already know this, Bob Marley converted to Christianity before he died..1980
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-13 13:21:00	@NewsHour Because over-testing is detrimental to students who, then, lose interest in learning. CC only helps Pearson make lots of $$$.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-13 13:47:07	@Longtails53 @glennbeck @theblaze Worth knowing! Thanks for sharing.

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-14 15:43:35	#commoncore Ourgreatest inventors, scientists,mathematicians,literary scholars,philosophers didn't have CommonCore/PARCC/standardized tests.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-14 16:49:44	Wondering whether or not your kids should opt out of PARCC? Maybe this will help.. http://t.co/EXSURE9rwn
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-14 17:47:18	#commoncore Students! Parents! Say NO TO PARCC. Your time is worth so much more than the tests. Demand real learning! #StopCommonCore
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-14 21:19:26	#commoncore - basically another attempt atsocialism.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-14 22:05:45	@AlexisinNH Govt overreach. Time waster (10-15hrs to take PLUS add prepping for it). Untested. Created by non-educators. Pearson ONLY wins.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-14 23:40:13	#CommonCore has never been the answer for kids' benefit. It has been the answer for socialized education &amp;serious profits for select groups.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-14 23:42:01	#commoncore &lt;--direct path to destroying the love of learning and teaching. We are NOT China, nor should we want to be like it.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-13 20:30:39	Me thinks: veterans are treated like crap as a way to discourage new enlistees,thus, quietly reducing the size of military.Ppl don't matter.

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-15 15:05:34	#pearsoniswatching Best way 2kill ed is test 2death, not trust local districts/teachers/parents and decide, on their behalf, how it's done.

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:10:13	@josm2028 so you being heterophobic bigot is ok? Hypocritical much??
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:12:51	@josm2028 The term marriage strictly means b/w man and woman. Anything else is bull and void.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:19:35	@josm2028 Matthew 19:4-5
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:23:20	@josm2028 To me and most others, it is. Your opinion doesn't determine what is legally binding.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:26:54	@josm2028 later. Per your bio, you seem to be someone who has nothing important to accomplish but bug people. I've got work to do. Sayonara.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:28:40	@josm2028 it was founded as such and should remain so
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:31:31	@josm2028 I'm against gay marriage, regardless the changes. I never have and never wi support it. Gay is a choice, a trend. It's sick.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:33:04	@josm2028 good luck with your heterophobic thingy.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:44:03	@josm2028 worded it wrong. But, yes, this nation has always been a Christian nation.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:45:48	@josm2028 I'm all about freedom. Freedom to have my beliefs and opinion. Why do you hate it?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:48:06	@josm2028 It's not a trend. A choice, yes. But I'm God's child, just like you are, and He will always have the final say.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:50:32	@josm2028 yes, you are. Sorry you've been brainwashed by your liberal mentors to think otherwise.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:53:13	@josm2028 NOBODY said you had to agree. You disagreed with me, remember? called me a 'bigot' - I thought I'd respond to see what's ur beef.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:55:08	@josm2028 I have a right 2 speak against gay marriage, don't I? Or must I submit 2your demands to accept it? I don't accept it, get over it.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:55:43	@josm2028 The ONLY God!
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:56:31	@josm2028 you'll find out one day that He does. Don't fight it. God is good, all of the time!
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:58:25	@josm2028 Nor does the gay marriage decide for everyone else. I don't like gay marriage, you don't like straight marriage. Ok, I get that.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-16 15:59:54	@josm2028 Not agreeing with something doesn't automatically make you a bigot. I don't agree with gay marriage, it's that simple.

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 18:28:57	@boydioro @NOMupdate My God CREATED nature. Procreation is only NATURAL b/w a man and a woman.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 18:31:21	@ATessio @NOMupdate He made all people. How they CHOOSE to live their lives is where He steps in in judgment.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 18:35:37	@boydioro @NOMupdate Ok. I don't believe in fairy tales, either. But I can speak my thoughts, right? Just like you, right?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 18:41:10	@boydioro @NOMupdate Sterile? You call them inferior? Wow. Where'd that come from?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 18:42:24	@boydioro @NOMupdate As I look back at my first comment, I do not see you attached. How is it that you butt in?

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 18:48:10	@boydioro @ATessio @NOMupdate Nope! I will add my religious views where I deem fit. Period.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 18:49:17	@boydioro @NOMupdate Then you should visit sites that are more conducive to your cause. Why stress yourself out about it?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 18:50:15	@boydioro @ATessio @NOMupdate It's a two way street. If you hate the expression of religious views, you're no less a bigot.

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 18:53:38	@boydioro @NOMupdate LGBT is just as offensive to some as religion is to others. Not a whole lot we can do.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 18:54:08	@boydioro @NOMupdate I'm tired of my religion being picked upon.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 18:55:30	@boydioro @ATessio @NOMupdate That's u being defensive. I back my argument by what drives my life. The Word of God drives me. What drives u?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 18:58:17	@boydioro @NOMupdate Yes. It's a term that has been reserved (for 1000's of yrs) 4 men/women. What's wrong w/"union" 4 gays?Why copy trad'l?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 19:02:26	@boydioro @NOMupdate I don't want to go in circles w/u, but males/females are created differently for a reason- the "plumbing"..

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 19:07:14	@ATessio @boydioro @NOMupdate " "hypocritical bigots"? Hmm interesting. You're not a bigot, then (using your context of 'bigot' here)?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 19:07:51	@ATessio @boydioro @NOMupdate ok. I don't really care.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 19:10:12	@boydioro @NOMupdate Which animals out there, please enlighten me, are gay? - you know, in the same sense that humans are?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 19:17:32	@ATessio @NOMupdate Why do you make assumptions about people you don't know? Be careful with that.

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 19:47:41	@ATessio @NOMupdate I make ALL of my choices in life - guided by morality. Sometimes I stray, but we're all sinners and should try better.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 19:48:55	@ATessio @boydioro @NOMupdate @franklion2014 Choose what? Is that how u became gay, lesbian or whatever u chose 2become? Someone force you?
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-18 19:50:17	@ATessio @boydioro @NOMupdate @franklion2014 I answered every question asked of me. Deal with the answers. Now you're a complete nuisance!

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-03-21 17:00:08	@mickskeptic It's useless. I'd rather my kids analyze classic books. But, that is merely my opinion.

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-14 13:08:45	@stephenstephan didn't recognize and probably wouldn't have cared had they recognized her. She's no celebrity!
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 17:16:01	@M_E_Adams Nice modern-day proclamation!

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 19:16:53	Tired of the liberal gayagenda shoved down our children's throats? Make a stand and keep them home this Friday! #DayofSilence
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 19:21:18	Actively spreading the word on the #DayofSilence WALKOUT!
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 19:22:58	I love the rainbow because it's God's creation &amp; promise. I despise that the lgbtqrstuv group hijacked it try to undermine God #DayofSilence
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 19:26:33	Keep your kids home this Friday if your schools are pushing the GLSEN/lgbtq agenda #DayofSilence #ccot #tcot
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-14 21:53:58	Do you know about Day of Silence, the progay movement in our public schools? Better get informed fast!Many schools are having it this Friday
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-14 21:57:39	A pro-lgbtq event-happening at a public school near u Fri, April, 17th, Day of Silence. Get informed, decide if appropriate for your child.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-14 22:00:19	If u don't agree w/the pro-lgbtq indoctrination happening in our public schools, then u better ✔️out DayofSilence b4 sending kids this Fri.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-14 22:04:11	Anti-heterosexual/-Christian indoctrination shoved down kids' throats by having our tax dollars allow Day of Silence to disrupt school days
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-14 22:18:49	@TXhighplains @PatDollard I do with one..
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 20:40:55	@Eatlotsmorevegg ..what they say everywhere there's a gay agenda. Kids r bullied/unsafe 4many reasons. This day selfishly excludes others.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 20:52:16	@SueBrinkmann @Eatlotsmorevegg Thank u, Sue. My point exactly. No 1grp shld get special treatment/attn. Sorry, I don't support exclusivity.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 20:54:32	@Eatlotsmorevegg @SueBrinkmann What this group has is huge lib backing speaking over everyone else. A bully in &amp; of itself 2undermine others
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 20:56:03	@Eatlotsmorevegg @SueBrinkmann Disagreeing shld never b misconstrued as hate, bigotry, racism, bullying, what have u.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 20:58:41	@Eatlotsmorevegg @SueBrinkmann The pro-lgbtq movement is all about undermining everyone who doesn't share the lgbt lifestyle choice.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 21:02:50	@Eatlotsmorevegg No. This group is pushing non-traditional sexual behavior in order to MAKE it accepted by all through induced guilt/pity.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 21:04:50	@SueBrinkmann Amen! Actively working on that in our community. Enough sexual indoctrination! Kids are in school for academics not sexuality.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 21:23:48	@Eatlotsmorevegg show me proof that you are born this way.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 21:30:49	@Eatlotsmorevegg I know ppl whose kids have been bullied 4being obese, Christian, a "nerd". I hardly sympathize w/1grp rallying 4attn.

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 21:47:40	@Eatlotsmorevegg definitely not bullying. I disagree w/supporting anti-bullying for just the 1grp. Very, VERY exclusionary!! Not nice.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-15 00:13:12	@IBDeditorials @deadvoter This is precisely why he had this "policy" in place - an invitation with a red carpet.

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-16 06:32:09	@KauaiNj lots of unhappy atheists
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-16 14:44:43	@KauaiNj It's supposed 2b about bullying - but just 4 1group. All you other bullied kids? Meh, maybe next time. You're not important enuff.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-16 12:20:02	There is a giant fixation and obsession w/sexuality in our schools and society, mainly concerning the lgbtqrtsuv-sexuality. Sick of it yet??

454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-16 14:37:46	Sent email to inform parents of the coming Day of Silence in our schools. Getting kind support from most but also negative/angry backlash...
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-16 14:39:26	@KauaiNj will b an interesting day. All I want is for schools to teach! If religion isn't welcome, none of this other crap should b welcome.
454427951	KauaiNj	2015-04-16 14:42:43	@KauaiNj ...1more reason 2pull kids out of fed-funded indoctrination centers. Dumbing kids while shoving radical agendas in2 their days.
