456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-22 14:11:02	@cebkcmo yet again we have no evidence that Russia done this. This article also states that the engine could have exploded #MH17
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-22 14:14:09	@Sandy_English yes you could be right. The EU want to control Ukrain. The west want to invade Syria. Its all about regime change #MH17

456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-22 14:35:52	@syedn_hussain well said sir.The problem is this is a campaign against Russia. Maybe connected with control in Ukraine and Syria #FlightMH17
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-22 14:40:26	@HeartScotNews I guess these "impartial" investigators will find something to blame Russia no doubt #MH17 #FlightMH17
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-22 14:44:40	@MikeyBlaze1 there we go then.Who really is to blame for this?As a pilot on#skynews said "why did this plane fly over war zone?"#FlightMH17
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-22 14:49:37	@MikeyBlaze1 I agree. It will be interesting to see what the west gains from this. Syria maybe? #FlightMH17 #MH17
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-22 14:52:15	@MikeyBlaze1 maybe plan A was to shoot a plane down over Syria and plan B over east Ukraine. Either way win win for the west #FlightMH17
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-23 22:02:36	From the makers of Iraq has WMDs the western meadia bring you....#FlightMH17 MH17...the Russians did it.
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-23 23:10:40	@nealmccoyfan @CNN what? Are you friggin serious? This is exactly what the west want. #MH17

456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-23 22:56:22	@BerlinMerlin yeh they really know how to fall in line with western propaganda yet no thought for 600 dead Palestinians #FlightMH17
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-23 23:03:10	@_LaBebaBeiia amazing the honour #Obama  gave the 600 victims of #GazaUnderAttack #gaza to vote against UN rights council

456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-23 23:08:32	@AlanBD why did #Obama decide to ignore #GazaUnderAttack by brutal #Israel leaving 600 innocent dead? #Gaza. #MH17
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-23 23:12:15	@LGNDRobin but over 600 dead in #Gaza.     #GazaUnderAttack #MH17
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-23 23:17:14	@PRI the west presents many accusations but no evidence about what happened to #MH17
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-23 23:25:25	@AafkeBrons @RealAlexJones no they were not. Do you think passenger jets fly over Syria? No #MH17
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-24 21:54:00	@BerlinMerlin could it be that islamist groups could and did use gases? Or could it be that WMDs are in Iraq?
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-24 21:56:04	@BerlinMerlin Islamists take gas field from Syrian government- http://t.co/D4V5i2c4PN
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-24 22:02:44	@BerlinMerlin talk to israel about islamists not existing. Oh whats that? You back israel
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-23 23:21:05	@AafkeBrons @RealAlexJones well if kiev knew that rebels had Buk missiles then why was #MH17 allowed to fly over conflict zone?
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-23 23:23:26	@sansakaseum or engine explosion #MH17
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-24 21:38:32	@SushiWeatherwax no you are quite wrong.
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-24 21:39:58	@BerlinMerlin by western sponsored regime change
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-24 21:46:35	@BerlinMerlin ironic that the west condemn Russian rebels but support Syrian rebbels yes? If they did not support then no conflict
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-24 21:49:01	@SushiWeatherwax no you are right. Surface to air missiles nor no fly zones make no difference. Dont be so stupid
456523609	sherhayward	2014-07-24 21:51:14	@BerlinMerlin really? And the proof is where? Hey but support Saddam to invade Iraq in the 80's yes?

456523609	sherhayward	2014-09-11 15:18:31	@Ocado do you use tax payers money for "pre-employment" training instead of paid on the job training? #Ocado what is pre-employment training

456523609	sherhayward	2014-10-05 23:12:28	@SiobhainMP your views are more right wing than ukip. I refuse to be on electoral reg as I dont want my privacy sold to third parties.
456523609	sherhayward	2014-10-05 23:16:23	@SiobhainMP also its a bit rich proclaiming to help "the underclass" when you neoliberals want to cut our benefits. Hypocrites!

456523609	sherhayward	2014-10-06 13:14:47	@SiobhainMP so why do people register to VOTE? Is it to vote? Also you cannot opt out from having your information being used by 3rd parties
456523609	sherhayward	2014-10-06 13:17:27	@SiobhainMP Can you give me a cast iron garantee that electorial reg information is never shared with any third party? Best you check first

456523609	sherhayward	2014-10-06 13:21:13	@SiobhainMP what like being forced to register to vote? What price on freedom do YOU put your so called democracy?
456523609	sherhayward	2014-10-06 13:21:45	@SiobhainMP shame on you

456523609	sherhayward	2014-10-06 13:24:39	@SiobhainMP so you are saying that people who recieve benefits are having something for nothing?
456523609	sherhayward	2014-10-10 05:47:21	@lovepembs wasted half an hour of my life tediously tormented by self-obsessed Hugh egotistical Whittow crow on about how great he is.
456523609	sherhayward	2014-10-10 06:08:13	@SiobhainMP registration should be to vote only. Even opting out everyones information is passed onto third parties.
456523609	sherhayward	2014-10-10 06:16:11	@SiobhainMP even if you opt out electorial register information is still sold onto third parties. The register should be for voting only.
456523609	sherhayward	2014-10-10 06:18:32	@SiobhainMP so your "bill is about a something for something society" so who is having something for nothing?

456523609	sherhayward	2015-01-24 12:27:12	@martynpeel really? A bit assuming of you. Try arguing your point instead of throwing accusations around.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-01-24 13:11:11	@martynpeel thanks to Bliar and Bushes illegal war and occupation of Iraq and support for islamic rebels in Syria Isis are able to operate
456523609	sherhayward	2015-01-24 13:13:59	@martynpeel what I say about European jews and barbaric israel is completely true and not just an accusation
456523609	sherhayward	2015-01-24 13:17:19	So western leaders from so called free and democratic countries drop everything and without an ounce of morality they rush to house of saud
456523609	sherhayward	2015-01-24 13:25:12	#davidcameron so without an ounce of morality @davecameroon drops everything and rushes to pay homage to a fellow brutal dictator
456523609	sherhayward	2015-01-27 18:05:28	#HolocaustMemorialDay ironically jews have learned nothing as they now illegally occupy and ethnic cleanse good honest Palestine.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-01-28 11:05:56	@JamesMelville they also failed by getting into bed with the city's banksters.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-01-28 11:07:09	@JamesMelville oh and an illegal war which killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people
456523609	sherhayward	2015-01-27 17:53:13	@davidblairdt so "the Holocaust was the greatest massacre in the worlds history"-bbc PM today. Guess you didn't do history in school you lie

456523609	sherhayward	2015-01-27 18:17:27	@Badoo thanks but I'd rather not find girls that I've previously "bumped" into.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-01-27 18:19:08	@GODthegoodone @Badoo there is no outside man. The matrix is real dude.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-01-27 18:24:20	@GODthegoodone @Badoo hmm from past experience I'd say that the best ladies hang around the slaughter house. Well they do in Wales anyway

456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-07 00:35:25	@AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim how about jews stop ethnic cleansing, killing of woman and children and illegal occupation of Palestine?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-08 14:39:58	@MayaOppenheim @AntiFascistNetw didn't say all jews however I have never heard a jew condemn israel
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-08 14:40:55	@AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim I didn't say all jews but ive never heard a jew condemn Israel.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-08 23:36:23	@AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim it is jews who are killing innocent woman and children and opressing Palestinians they are not buddists ffs
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-08 23:37:58	@AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim its ok in the west to say "muslim terrorist" but not jewish murderers? Hypocracy!
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-08 23:39:48	@AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim and no its not anti-semitic to rightly point out that its jews killing innocent Palestinians. They are!
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-08 23:42:39	@benn992 @AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim yes and the zionists claiming to be jewish are using the jewish card and sending jews to kill.

456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-08 23:48:53	@MUFC2015M @AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim so children playing football on a beach are human shields?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-08 23:50:47	@MUFC2015M @AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim how about segregation and controlled movement of peoples, energy, water, supplies and medicine?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-08 23:52:03	@MUFC2015M @AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim maybe it would be a fair fight if Palestine was funded and armed by a super power eh?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-08 23:53:05	@AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim so tell me again, what religion is nutteryahoo?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-08 23:55:05	@MUFC2015M @AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim but the country has no armed forces to speak off. Do you think Hamas should throw money at israel
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-08 23:56:47	@MUFC2015M @AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim they also take Palestine farm land. Lots of supplies never make it into Palestine.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-09 00:07:00	@AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim so let me get this right. You believe the news and you have the nerve to say I believe in propaganda? Lol
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-09 00:09:21	@AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim oh I know that Hamas are killing the odd jew here and there. I wonder why.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-09 00:10:53	@AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim jews didnt fight for the land that is now 
israel it was bloody given to them lol
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-09 00:11:53	@AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim funny how the UN considers it to be an illegal occupation of Palestine land. Or are they also wrong?

456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-09 00:20:01	@MUFC2015M @AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim also are you saying that because land is unhabited then it does not belong to anyone?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-02-09 00:20:43	@MUFC2015M @AntiFascistNetw @MayaOppenheim so I could come to israel and claim land as being Welsh? Lol

456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-24 09:14:00	@taigstaigs I tend to agree with this statement. However, so was Blair. Labour have moved too far right in an attempt to get into government

456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-26 11:43:10	@georgegalloway Nice one George I will be listening. Maybe ask the ConDems why those on work programme are not on unemployment figures
456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-26 11:44:48	@georgegalloway Also why those who have been sanctioned also don't show up on unemployment and claiming figures.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-26 11:46:38	@boycottworkfare @pollytoynbee yes the right wing Labour are now scrambling around trying to deceive voters to gain votes.

456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-26 21:11:20	@SCrabb2015 @WTelegraph yet again the pm lies.  Debt has gone up more than ever before. Pm lies about jobs.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-26 21:13:31	@SCrabb2015 @WTelegraph pm lies about unemployment figures. Those on work programme or sanctioned do not show on unemployment figures
456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-26 21:15:26	@SCrabb2015 @WTelegraph @RadioPembs so the right thing to do was to increase debt more than ever to reduce the deficit
456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-26 21:17:52	@SCrabb2015 @WTelegraph @RadioPembs so difficult decisions are to cut benefits to us peasants while you support millionaire bonuses
456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-27 10:51:47	@Lord_Sugar @Muqadaam I never thought I would say this but I agree with "Lord" Sugar
456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-27 10:55:08	@AdnanSadiq01 @Muqadaam well yes we should expect the Islamifobic western media bullshit hype.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-27 11:21:36	@MayaOppenheim oh I do hope that this is true.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-27 11:24:27	@AlexLittlejohns @georgegalloway well yeah could you imagine the reaction from Washington if Saudi supported Gazza?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-28 12:02:16	@paulrogers002 @boycottworkfare I hope it all goes well for you my friend and don't let the bastards get you down.

456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-28 12:08:18	@RadioPembs good news. We don't need even more traffic and parking nightmares in Haverfordwest.The idiotic PCC don't plan for these problems
456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-29 18:25:45	@AdnanSadiq01 @georgegalloway @bantam_polly the problem is I'm not hearing this from Labour. Nothing about bank bailouts

456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-29 18:31:13	@AdnanSadiq01 @georgegalloway @bantam_polly The unelected government make cuts to social care expecting 3rd sector to step in
456523609	sherhayward	2015-03-29 18:37:34	@bantam_polly @georgegalloway "service users" needing a bed in Pembrokeshire could end up far away on a MH ward in Aberystwyth or Llanelli
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-01 08:47:23	@RadioPembs you can't fool an idiot lol but nice try. Would be interesting to know how many do fall for it though.

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-02 10:58:42	@SCrabb2015 the business leaders you support are @Conservatives donors, non doms, tax evading and tory lords or mp's

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-05 10:22:24	@georgegalloway this I disagree on. Forget separation for a sec and SNP are further left than Labour.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-05 10:29:09	@NickyMorgan01 @Conservatives @SCrabb2015 Teachers today are saying they are seeing victorian conditions due to tory cuts

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-04 10:42:29	How many @Conservatives does it take to report a pedophile? Nobody knows because of national security. @EveningHarold
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-02 23:24:40	@SCrabb2015 BREAKING NEWS. Pascal Soriot did NOT sign the letter to the Daily Telegraph. The @Conservatives lied. Again.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-05 18:25:32	@Alexanderknief @rustyrockets you do know that money is a symbol of debt. The same debt that capitalism feeds from.

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-03 00:06:25	@Conservatives @SCrabb2015 so the tory posh retard has the cheek to tarnish others with future tax increases yet he put up VAT to 20%
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-03 00:08:37	@Conservatives @SCrabb2015 I do hope you are reading these tweets Stephen my old friend.

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-06 11:04:36	@TeamGeorgeG @metpoliceuk @georgegalloway I blame government and media for islamofobic propaganda campaign for capitalist gain.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-06 11:13:39	@TeamGeorgeG  @georgegalloway the so called "war on terror" is a capitalist invention for monetary and domination gain. Killing makes money
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-06 11:39:05	@Iran @Muqadaam why is it that peaceful countries like Iran are prevented from anything nuclear yet murdering Israel and the West are not?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-06 11:40:23	@Iran @Muqadaam the only state to use nuclear weapons dictates who can and can't have them yet give them to murderers like Israel.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-03 09:40:03	@SCrabb2015 @Conservatives a lame argument.  It's like saying that Cameron is in charge of the US Democrats. Different countries. Get real.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-03 09:44:07	@SCrabb2015 @Conservatives  is Ed in charge of the Welsh government? No. Can Ed dictate what happens in Welsh schools? No feeble Steve Crabb

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-03 09:49:01	@BBCiPlayer make sure you can access BBC propaganda by downloading the app
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-03 09:52:25	@SCrabb2015 Welsh education is devolved and has nothing to do with Ed and UK labour. Feeble arguments lame mp done nothing for Pembrokeshire

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-03 10:14:04	@EveningHarold BREAKING NEWS. Cameron has stopped laying eggs. Tory government were afraid this would happen so avoided TV debate with Ed
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-07 09:05:17	@MayaOppenheim for some reason this disgusts me less than the @Conservatives and there persecution of us poor while defending the rich
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-07 09:09:04	@Paninaro86 @georgegalloway yes I strongly agree. He has ripped the heart/morality out of Labour. Parting from unions to cosy with the city
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-08 08:23:01	@WTelegraph this is what happens when @SCrabb2015 and his nasty @Conservatives cut the Welsh budget then blame Labour assembly government
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-08 08:30:13	@LloydsBankBiz due to @Conservatives cuts to benefits to bail out you and your fellow criminal bankers. 3rd sector is picking up the pieces
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-08 08:33:21	@claptonwolf @georgegalloway @UKLabour it's not a good idea to have a right wing war criminal unless to appeal to right wing press + voters
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-08 08:35:09	@SCrabb2015 why do you hide like a coward and not engage on twitter?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-08 09:28:53	@Muqadaam @KTHopkins the best thing to do is to ignore the stupid bitch.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-08 09:30:57	@RadioPembs not listening to radio Pembrokeshire, that's what I have planned for today
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-08 09:35:04	@PembsHerald my guess is that she stole the food to feed herself and family due to @Conservatives @SCrabb2015 cuts to benefits and nazi DWP
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-10 09:36:19	@Patrick4Dales @SCrabb2015 so how DARE you say that these are difficult decisions when they are not effect you.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-10 09:46:06	@georgegalloway only yesterday I was wondering when the tories were going to use her
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-10 17:10:01	@George_Osborne @SCrabb2015 what utter crap.why then are food bank queues grown? See the poverty in Pembrokeshire council estates.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-10 17:12:57	@lauraknightly @SCrabb2015 no wonder the coward didn't answer my questions
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-10 09:34:39	@Patrick4Dales @SCrabb2015 well the difficult decisions made by @Conservatives  have reduced my benefits while MPs have a pay rise.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-10 09:39:35	@RadioPembs well today I plan not to listen to #RadioPembrokeshire but thanks for asking anyway. 
When do you plan on having a MP debate?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-10 09:50:14	@HSBC_UK so have you laundered money or helped billionaire's evade tax. How long will it be until we bail you banksters out again?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-10 09:53:17	@andersjames16 @SCrabb2015 How benefit sanctions left me sleeping on the streets http://t.co/MqrifM72SF
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-10 10:00:54	@Muqadaam @georgegalloway hope you don't mind me re tweeting a couple of your pictures to my local tory mp who never answers my tweets
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-10 10:08:05	@BBCWalesNews @SCrabb2015 yes my local mp who never answers my tweets. He is scared and hiding from the people of Pembrokeshire.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-11 11:53:14	@EveningHarold Thanks to the @Conservatives economic plan we now have two Hoovers. Yep, we are a two Hoover household.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-11 12:17:59	@EveningHarold according to @Conservatives 3 days off work to volunteer is good but 3 days off to strike for fair pay and pensions is bad.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-11 17:01:55	@SCrabb2015 @PreseliPembTory don't believe you
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-13 10:53:21	This is a must see video that the @Conservatives don't want you to see.

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-13 21:03:34	@MilfordHavenNPT I live in Dewsland Street and I have Seen some PCSOs walking around here thanks. I was joking around with my first tweet.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 07:35:53	@PaulWoodcock2 look who I've just stumbled across on twitter. How ya doing mate? Congrats on escaping this shit hole Pembrokeshire.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 07:39:07	@Vectorcurl @raymonddelauney @TippleJack well he did say this is not acceptable don't re tweet this.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 07:42:17	@maureen_monger just as I thought. But don't you base your opinion on facts or do you read tea leaves.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 07:50:05	@Vectorcurl  @georgegalloway @ericcartmanfat I've looked through many of @TippleJack tweets and find no anti semitic comments Vector.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 07:54:16	@ukrespectparty @georgegalloway @sharazbfd can you please prove that the comments regarding Respect being antisemitic are wrong.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 08:00:20	@Vectorcurl @mghots @raymonddelauney I have no doubts that some in Palestine would be anti Jewish but quite frankly who could blame them?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 08:03:04	@mghots @Vectorcurl @raymonddelauney @HamasInfoEn so have you endured the brutal treatment dished out by Israel? No thought not
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 08:04:52	@mghots @Vectorcurl @georgegalloway @ericcartmanfat @TippleJack no you are wrong but I am ant-zionist however. There is a difference.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 08:06:05	@mghots @Vectorcurl @georgegalloway @ericcartmanfat @TippleJack perhaps you are Islamifobic
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 08:11:45	@Vectorcurl @mghots @raymonddelauney @TippleJack so he ain't in Bradford? Hell he ain't even in Europe ffs
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 08:13:27	@Vectorcurl @mghots @georgegalloway @ericcartmanfat @TippleJack so there is no connection between anti Muslim and antisemitic?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 08:14:55	@mghots @Vectorcurl @georgegalloway @ericcartmanfat @TippleJack yes that's right mate well done. Now can I get on with my day please?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 08:16:33	@mghots @Vectorcurl @raymonddelauney @HamasInfoEn where am I? I have really had enough of you clowns.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 08:33:57	@mghots @Vectorcurl @raymonddelauney @HamasInfoEn so here we go again. Accusations with no proof.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 08:35:41	@mghots @Vectorcurl @raymonddelauney @HamasInfoEn yes I reckon that there are anti jews in Palestine as there are anti Muslims in Israel.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 09:32:57	@TippleJack hi my friend. I have got  trolls claiming that you are antisemitic. could I please ask if you have a connection with Respect?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 09:40:12	@Macdad25 @Vectorcurl @mghots Mitt Romney: ‘Palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace’. And you agree with that?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 09:49:20	@Macdad25 @Vectorcurl @mghots let's be clear. I am not. I repeat. I am not having this argument. This has nothing to do with Respect.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 09:53:25	@georgegalloway @rupertmurdoch what a surprise. George respects and defends good people of Gaza and is branded antisemitic by islamaphobes.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 09:56:30	@Macdad25 keep prodding a cornered rat and it will go for you. Zionist continue illegal occupation and unlawful killings so is it any wonder
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 09:58:12	@Macdad25 and Israel is sponsored by the US. Nice talking to you. Have a great day and bye bye
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 10:00:52	@SCrabb2015 inflate another housing bubble with low paid workers and reduce public housing at the same time. Yeah well done.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 10:43:50	@SCrabb2015 @Paul_Miller268 why do the @Conservatives only talk about working people? How about sick and disabled people? You care not
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 10:52:04	@SCrabb2015 @Paul_Miller268 it should be about everyone and not just working people. The @Conservatives are not about all of Britain.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 17:59:51	@monddi @WTelegraph Yeh it's no wonder that politicians can treat you like kids and get away with murder. Just add TV soaps for brain dead.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 18:00:55	@HSBC_UK hi I'm not a millionaire but can you help me evade tax?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 18:03:37	The @Conservatives want to move housing association peasants out of expensive rich areas of the country. They are all in it together
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 18:06:59	@robgarland15 @MilfordHavenNPT @mawwTechnical @DyfedPowys yes what a fine bunch of fine looking fellows these fishermen are. Well done.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 18:12:10	@WTelegraph @WTelegraph oh well that's what happens when the @Conservatives cut the Welsh budget. Welcome to Tory Hell.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 12:51:25	@georgegalloway @Muqadaam @njonesdp so we can't criticise Israel now? If you condemned the Israel illegal occupation or slaughter of ...
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 12:52:48	@georgegalloway @Muqadaam @njonesdp or condemn the killing of innocent Palestinian people then you get branded antisemitic
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 13:04:10	@SCrabb2015 thanks to Stephen De-Waine I've read information that you mr Crabb have been flip flopping properties and making huge profits
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 13:37:00	@raymonddelauney @georgegalloway @ericcartmanfat @Vectorcurl well Vector your tweet from 21 hours ago where I asked for evidence, deleted

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 13:39:59	@raymonddelauney @georgegalloway @ericcartmanfat @Vectorcurl you deleted your tweet then go about falsely claiming that I'm antisemitic
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 13:41:36	@raymonddelauney @georgegalloway @ericcartmanfat @Vectorcurl so Vector are you and your fellow trolls IDF?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 13:59:33	@Vectorcurl @raymonddelauney @georgegalloway @ericcartmanfat @TippleJack well Vector the only thing that you have achieved is spamming me
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 14:04:18	@Vectorcurl @raymonddelauney @georgegalloway @ericcartmanfat Vector you have shown me nothing but disrespect. Welcome to my blocked list
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 14:09:19	@Muqadaam @georgegalloway Yeh I've had a few Zionists on here today spamming me with lies and accusations
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 20:27:39	@gailymom @Vectorcurl @mghots @raymonddelauney @TippleJack hahaha Gail. Please tell me how you came to this earth shattering revolution?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 20:33:33	@gailymom so if I'd said I have no doubt that some in Israel would be anti Islamic but who could blame them. What would you say?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 20:38:39	@TippleJack well I was thinking the same thing my friend. So anyway I'm blocking the trolls. It's been great speaking with you. Take care.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 20:45:30	@TippleJack Muhammad I am very impressed with your blog my friend. Everything you describe has been happening to me. Keep up the good work.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 07:30:10	@SCrabb2015 @Paul_Miller268 so guy's what is worse deficit or debt. Oh and Paul Stephen is hiding from my questions.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 07:32:47	@SCrabb2015 @Paul_Miller268 the @Conservatives are determined to inflate a new housing bubble and yet again reduce public housing.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 20:55:13	@gailymom @Vectorcurl @mghots @raymonddelauney @TippleJack Gail hail bail sail frail tail scale shale jail whale stale kale quail Roger
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 20:57:21	@Vectorcurl @raymonddelauney @TippleJack are you a wizard vector?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 20:58:35	@Vectorcurl @mghots @raymonddelauney @HamasInfoEn @TippleJack Yeah he's a hunk ain't he?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 21:02:40	@Olvagga @MartinTheSpur @mghots @Vectorcurl @raymonddelauney @TippleJack I agree it's time to get rid of the dummy. 
One thing you forget is
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 21:08:20	@David_Lofts @TippleJack @CabbyMan63 hey cab are you a cab driver my friend?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 21:27:51	@David_Lofts @TippleJack @CabbyMan63 I'm just gonna ask cab something he knows about. How much from Cardiff to Gatwick?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 21:32:05	@David_Cameron @SCrabb2015 so what about the rest of us non workers? Nothing but cuts, sanctions, slave labour, poverty and suicide
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 21:34:47	@TwitterAdsUK don't you think that there is more important things to talk about? Hundreds of thousands killed in Iraq, Afghanistan by the UK
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-14 21:48:29	@David_Lofts @Olvagga @TippleJack @CabbyMan63 do you do mates rates?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-15 20:35:31	@georgegalloway @TeamGeorgeG @ukrespectparty hey George don't go carrying a violin case will you my friend?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-16 12:10:32	@WTelegraph looks like it's all over now.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-16 11:15:39	@maureen_monger I'm just curious how did your grandparent fight for freedom of speech exactly?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-16 11:32:37	@BBCRadioWales @SCrabb2015 why are those unemployed, claiming benefits and on the work programme not on unemployment figures?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-16 11:34:36	@BBCRadioWales @SCrabb2015 tax avoidance and non doms account for £119 billion in lost tax revenue. Figures from 39degrees.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-16 11:35:48	@BBCRadioWales @SCrabb2015 will he pay back the money he made on his property in London after flip flopping?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-16 11:36:25	@BBCRadioWales @SCrabb2015 why won't he answer his tweets?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-16 11:38:22	@a479557099af42f @TeamGeorgeG @georgegalloway they won't talk about pedophilia it's national security.

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-18 10:11:14	@bbc_parody @Muqadaam @georgegalloway never mind the Americans that were killed. Up to a million of civilians, women and children killed.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-18 10:21:08	@SWEveningPost @SCrabb2015 when are you going to answer my tweets Stephen? You are hiding from my questions
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-18 10:35:15	@maureen_monger the problem is Maureen is when you make accusations like Galloway condones "Muslim murderers" you need evidence to back it!
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-18 10:36:50	@georgegalloway @TeamGeorgeG go George, you get em

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-17 08:08:02	Tell John Lewis to pay cleaners the living wage! http://t.co/z0O2Q0nGy2 via @UKChange
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-17 08:09:39	@maureen_monger me blinkered? In what way?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-17 08:12:21	@maureen_monger I haven't a problem believe me. I find it perplexing that someone could make a comment and not know why they did it.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-17 08:14:44	@maureen_monger oh well I suppose some people can have a opinion based on nothing. Hope you have a nice day my friend no malice.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-19 08:50:58	@jsuknewsfeed @boycottworkfare IDS is deluded
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-19 08:58:51	700 people feared drowned whilst fleeing tribal wars in Libya. Although the UK+US devastated Libya forcing regime change they wont help.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-20 10:07:04	With the SNP Labour will have a majority. This is why the @Conservatives are demonising the SNP and scaremongering a labour SNP coalition.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-20 11:20:48	@WTelegraph well what do you expect? Them at the top are all in it together. This is why you pay council tax for their lifestyle.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-20 11:28:13	@WTelegraph no not doing it. I refuse to take part in this corporate plutocracy. Westminster needs bulldozing with them all in it.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-20 11:31:46	@WTelegraph typo there should read their
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-20 11:39:18	@rustyrockets when is it going nation wide. Dvd? I live in the arse end of Wales how can I see it?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-20 11:44:53	Why do the @BBCBreaking persist in calling thousands of dead drowned people "immigrants"? They know that many in the UK are anti immigration
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-20 12:57:24	@RadioPembs very very strong chemical smell just come in over Milford Haven
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-21 16:17:55	@sinnaluvva @boycottworkfare one free labour means one less paid employment
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-20 17:37:46	Regarding the thousands drowning whilst fleeing war torn Libya. Col Gaddafi did warn the invading UK and USA that this would happen.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-21 12:02:45	@HSBC_UK here's a tip. Become a MP then flip flop your property's at the tax payers expense. Then sell property making hundreds of thousands
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-21 12:07:25	What's a wronga Wonger? @OpenWonga
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-21 16:51:03	@refuted @boycottworkfare ok I am a follower of yours. One thing that worries me is tweets that scares vulnerable people may never happen
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-21 13:36:13	@SCrabb2015 @LBSBMLTD @bmf_merchants sad to hear that @Conservatives  will sell social housing causing a housing crisis.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-21 13:38:42	@trevortimm @ggreenwald @EricLiptonNYT yep and British people think that there is freedom of speech/press and democracy.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-21 13:42:33	@MazMHussain @ggreenwald same as Iran and Ukraine. The west ain't happy till they can impose an American puppet dictatorship.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-20 10:18:33	@BBCNormanS you would have thought that seeing as there is an election looming @SCrabb2015 would engage on social media. No he is hiding.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-20 11:22:58	@WTelegraph they are corrupt through and through. They hide there accounts and answer to no one.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-20 11:36:58	@Paul4Cowick @boycottworkfare @David_Cameron @MarrShow this shows that the @Conservatives  are short sighted hypocrites.

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-23 08:20:20	@WelshConserv @SCrabb2015 hey crabby why are you hiding from my questions?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-23 08:23:31	@HSBC_UK here's a tip. Don't buy social housing. There is a shortage and only rich landlord's profit. Now can I have me money?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-23 09:13:26	@MilfordHavenNPT well I think the best ice cream for a police person would be a Magnum.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-23 11:45:20	@SCrabb2015 how many people in Wales claim a benefit or pension? 
These people won't be voting for @Conservatives due to £12 billion cuts
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-23 11:52:31	@SCrabb2015 @WelshConserv @meirionj nice that you can swan around the country whilst Pembrokeshire goes down the pan.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-23 11:56:39	@MilfordHavenNPT see I knew that it was a good idea to follow the local police.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-23 12:35:27	@rustyrockets for some reason every time I see the st George flag I think of the national front.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-23 12:40:49	@rustyrockets Christian knights still wage war against Muslims in Jerusalem and the middle east. This flag is soaked in blood.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-23 12:53:23	@SCrabb2015 @WelshConserv @meirionj nice that you can swan around the country whilst Pembrokeshire goes down the pan.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-23 16:22:01	First he said let them drown. Now because it's all over the TV and an election looming #DavidCameron makes a token gesture.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-23 13:40:41	@jamieoliver @rustyrockets the guy on Britain's rich list. Hypocritical much?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-22 19:57:23	@savechildrenuk a good start would be to distance UK from USA. Change foreign policy to not murdering or sponsored murdering civilians

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-24 17:16:27	The recession happened because of the free market and deregulation. We bailed the banks and now they complain when regulations are imposed.

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-26 10:19:36	Does @LibDems Clegg think we are fool's?  Here he is again trying to blame Labour for the world financial crisis. He is defending banks.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-26 10:20:56	@rustyrockets seen it. Love it. This should be on the national curriculum.

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-24 13:06:32	I blame #DavidCameron the @Conservatives and Westminster for the murders in Libya, the drowning of fleeing people and corrupt foreign policy

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-24 13:38:51	@oohincensed @boycottworkfare @Avitusparta what saddens me the most is that your Daily Hail or Sun reader wouldn't see a problem with this
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-24 13:40:42	@oohincensed @boycottworkfare @Avitusparta politicians and media have turned us into a selfish and uncaring society. Poverty Britain.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-24 13:43:29	@SCrabb2015 ummm aren't you the one who voted to increase VAT? Hypocritical much? #DavidCameron @Conservatives
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-26 18:11:02	@Russ_Hammer @jamieoliver @rustyrockets Oliver has right wing views claiming that unemployed have massive TVs and eat cheese snd chips.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-26 18:12:37	@Russ_Hammer @jamieoliver @rustyrockets anyone for a 80-100 hour working week Oliver?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-26 18:13:57	@Russ_Hammer @jamieoliver @rustyrockets Oliver is a hypocrite changing his views to be outspoken and populist.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-26 19:01:10	@MilfordHavenNPT have you informed the seagulls family and when will you release the seagulls name?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-24 14:12:27	@O2 do you evade paying taxes like Vodafone?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-24 16:06:18	@bbc_parody @georgegalloway yep that's about the size of it. How about Cameron clapping in the background.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-24 16:09:25	@bbc_parody @georgegalloway no you can't or you might have police knock your door. This happened to me
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-24 16:13:20	@BBCRadio4  say HSBC is respected around the world. Really? These criminals respected? They are in it together.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-24 16:20:27	@Louiseaileen70 @BBCRadio4 so you defend the criminal HSBC and DARE call them respected world wide? These banksters are immoral and criminal
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-24 16:23:21	@Louiseaileen70 @BBCRadio4 HSBC and the like are the problem with this country. We are paying in blood and tears for their greed.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-24 16:25:58	@Louiseaileen70 @BBCRadio4 disgusting how you defend the criminals.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-24 16:31:45	@Louiseaileen70 @BBCRadio4 serfdom is alive and well in HSBC land.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-27 10:01:35	@SCrabb2015 well my missis has owned a popular restaurant for ten years now and hasn't seen any difference between labour or conservative
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-27 12:31:58	@ersa_news @scope yeah that's right, exploit unskilled low paid disabled instead of giving help, support, dignity and choice they deserve
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-27 12:33:37	@ersa_news @scope the focus is on the £6 billion and not the person. The disabled have become a commodity.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-27 12:34:37	@entitledto @ersa_news it doesn't work. Should be scrapped.  Don't bother.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-27 12:36:43	@enteri2i @ersa_news @DavidMorris2015 IDS reforms to the welfare state has led to poverty, hunger, homelessness and suicides.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-27 12:38:27	@ersa_news @salvationarmy yep the Sally Army also use unemployed, unpaid slave labour.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-27 12:40:46	@ersa_news @scope is that the potential the individual wishes or the potential for exploitation?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-27 20:03:40	@AmbassadorRice @ggreenwald who's this Susan comedian? Yeah it's so free they gag Edward Snowden's revelations
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-27 20:30:21	@TescoFood don't Tesco get creative with their tax returns?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-29 11:57:20	So if #GrevilleJanner  can deny any wrong doing then it stands to reason that he understands what is going on and can go to court.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-29 12:34:49	@bookwormbett @boycottworkfare @bmstores I will also boycott and ask my friend's and family to do the same.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-29 12:53:06	@ggreenwald yep. It's a militarised state. There is more freedom in Russia.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-29 17:53:18	@TheSocReview @unemploymentmov nah she's just a nutter
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-29 19:53:26	@ZEPHYoRUS well if #GrevilleJanner has the mental capacity to say "no comment" then he has the capacity to attend court.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 08:04:38	@MayaOppenheim yes the nasty party have used the world wide recession and trouble in Greece to justify ideological welfare cuts
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 10:49:53	The @Conservatives claim that SNP want to break up the UK but will #DavidCameron  rule out UKIP coalition as they intend to break up Europe?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 11:11:30	How can #grevillejanner family claim that he is innocent without proving it? Funny that Assange doesn't get the same treatment.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 11:14:05	@Craig4CardiffN @SCrabb2015 hey crabby.  Answer your bloody tweets and stop hiding
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 11:20:23	@SCrabb2015 no its not don't lie. The City of London is at the heart of your party. That and non doms.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 10:44:58	So why is it that #DavidCameron  ruled out a head to head debate with Ed and Nik claiming it's too close to election yet he is on TV 2night?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 12:18:36	@Sandy_English yep even if the cops are killin ya arse ya shouldn't smash an innocent window.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 12:20:36	@SCrabb2015 you can't move on Twitter for Crabby supporter's lol
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 12:24:29	@EveningHarold don't lizards lay eggs?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 12:27:30	@LeightonEarly @ZEPHYoRUS @HIVstories oh yes wouldn't that open a can of worms. Mind you the elite get away with murder. Blair case in point
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 12:34:31	@RaniaKhalek so yeah,  Europe bomb the crap out of Libya thus throwing it into civil war then gun down/drown people fleeing. Sounds right.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:08:25	#QuestionTime the UK can't run out of money
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:08:48	#QuestionTime but debt has more than doubled

456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:13:53	Nah he's a muppet https://t.co/fBhd3YdfMK
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:16:23	He lies about Greece.  Britain is very different as it can print money.  Dave is a moron #QuestionTime
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:18:31	@see75 Britain can't run out of money. It just prints more.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:24:38	But non doms can send money abroad #QuestionTime
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:36:52	When Labour was in government the tories NEVER said that they were spending too much. How thick are the public #QuestionTime
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:50:40	@idunnodoi but that bloke was talking crap. Like most of the sheeple they have no idea about economics
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:52:47	@tweetiewifey so are you telling me that Cameron won't need a coalition. You are delusional love
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:55:02	@CharBird82 I did read your drivel love
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:56:35	@tweetiewifey well there we are then. Why mention it?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:58:08	@tweetiewifey I agree. I won't vote for any of them and good for you.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:01:32	@idunnodoi no the arsehole asking the questions suffers from selective memory. Britain can't go broke.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:06:51	@tweetiewifey glad to hear it. So now you can have a go at Nick. Go on, you know you want to
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:08:42	@CharBird82 here's a fact that you and your ilk can chew on. Britain can't and won't ever go broke.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:13:30	@tweetiewifey sorry if I offended you. I do get a bit excited sometimes. I should have known not to upset a female.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:22:38	Here we go again. Britain is not like Greece and can't go broke. deficit is not always bad. Worst time to cut is in recession #QuestionTime
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:32:13	@AlexandraLBryer @bbcqt Britain can't go broke. debt has now increased more than deficit cut. When Labour was in tories never cry over spend
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:34:18	@alicecmnewton minus nothing
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:41:49	@David_Cameron @SCrabb2015 first sanctions. First homeless. First foodbank. First non dom. First millionaire tax avoidance.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:53:04	@beef_steak22 and the tories are for the working class right?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 21:08:16	@beef_steak22 I strongly suggest you watch Emperors New Clothes. It's on Amazon
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 21:13:30	@beef_steak22 anyway enjoy the rest of your evening. I'm getting me some grub
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:08:02	#QuestionTime so non doms and millionaires don't pay taxes but that's ok
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:12:47	But you have racked up debt you idiot #QuestionTime
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:03:37	@tweetiewifey geeez. But to criticise Milliband for something that Cameron will have to do is just wrong
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:05:37	@CharBird82 but her questions were based on lies, little fairy's, never never land and not fact.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:16:40	@CharBird82 lol I know that it's a bit too difficult for some to comprehend
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:19:41	@CharBird82 that's probably the most sensible thing you've tweeted all evening
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:46:36	@carrieapples @SCrabb2015 the stupid cow who has no idea of economics. Britain can't go broke ffs
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:49:45	@AlexandraLBryer @bbcqt bank of ENGLAND off the leash.  Lol omfg lol
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:51:46	@AlexandraLBryer @bbcqt the problem is you see is that Blair took Labour to the right into tory territory. So try again
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 21:01:07	@AlexandraLBryer @bbcqt to regulate the bank of England? I agree that FSA is rubbish however it was Thatcher who tore the regulations up
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 21:10:06	The end of the world is nigh if there is a Labour/SNP coalition
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 21:12:36	@beef_steak22 I agree with you my friend. However who says different? Don't forget it was Thatcher who hid unemployed on IB
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 21:38:27	@djozols @ggreenwald yep we live in a free and fair society.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 21:39:59	@djozols @ggreenwald it's like saying that our soldiers fought for freedom of speech. However you can't use your freedom of speech
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 21:47:04	I see an alter of slavery has burnt down in Guildford area. What a shame. 
Aristocracy might cry. Didn't pay your bedroom tax did ya? Lol
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 21:50:34	@BBCNews @nationaltrust what a shame that an altar to slavery should burn down. Should have paid your bedroom tax.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-01 14:22:14	@MilfordHavenNPT hi I didn't know you did that for mud on roads but no I was just making a general comment thanks.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-01 06:37:44	@EveningHarold it's the afterbirth that I'm worried about
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 12:15:38	@EwanFindlay @SCrabb2015 what did Crabby say about Murco?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:04:56	Most of those claiming housing benefit work #QuestionTime
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:12:02	Oh so it's Labour's fault there was a recession #QuestionTime
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:15:20	Just put tax up for the rich. It's only fair.  #QuestionTime
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:31:03	Yeah the jobs he created are so good that housing benefit bill has increased and so has food banks #QuestionTime
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:42:38	Britain can't go broke ffs u retard. Also condems sold off Royal mail off cheap #QuestionTime
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:45:11	Geeez I can't believe how stupid this audience is. Look back when Labour was in and tell me when tories claim they over spend #QuestionTime
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 19:47:41	@CharBird82 by her stupidity. Every question she asked was based on crap. Sorry. Try not reading the Sun love
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:10:27	@CharBird82 but Charlotte.  The woman was talking drivel. She may as well have asked questions about Father Christmas.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:27:35	@steph_takemeout must be true what they say about blondes
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 20:29:37	@AlexandraLBryer @bbcqt and what was he left with? The tories unregulated the banks and started the so called free market
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 21:03:49	@beef_steak22 so if someone gets laid off,  due to cuts, after working for 30 odd years, paying NI. Do they get dole for nothing?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 21:05:52	@beef_steak22 what about the millions that work and claim housing benefit? How about Osborne and Cameron inheritance?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 21:31:28	@tweetiewifey yes he does. That's why I voted Lib Dem last time and I still feel cheated and resentful. Never again.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 21:32:33	@tweetiewifey have you seen Emperor's New Clothes? It's on Amazon and well worth a watch.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-04-30 21:34:21	@radicaldaily @ggreenwald what? That's insane. Let Obama fight in Yemen.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-01 00:05:39	Did Judge Lowell Goddard Lie to Parliament? - Kiwisfirst http://t.co/lnlNhl5G0B   no wonder Janner walks free
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-01 13:35:45	@rockmom @ggreenwald it's not just Iran that executes gay men is it rockmom?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-01 13:37:49	@rockmom @ggreenwald and the US needs to stop arming Israel that kill innocent women and children. They should also condemn violation of UNC
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-01 13:41:23	@RoyalMailStamps make sure that government isn't under charging for them stamps by 50%
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-01 13:42:40	@MilfordHavenNPT getting farmers to clean mud off roads would be a good idea
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-01 13:45:50	@OhMyDecades @boycottworkfare anyone against the corrupt establishment is regarded a terrorist.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-02 12:13:47	@georgegalloway @Muqadaam yes for the good of the country we need the tories out or all hell will break lose.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 07:37:14	@chunkymark frying pan or fire you have to pick the least painful of the two. For me that would be Labour but I refused to register lol
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 07:39:27	@chunkymark yep @Conservatives or @UKLabour , both are nothing but corporate puppets.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 07:47:53	@blacktriangle1 @ThirdForceNews  so charities claim they are being blackmailed, intimidated and bullied. Well that's how unemployed feel.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 07:53:57	@blacktriangle1 @ThirdForceNews "round 70% of those on the scheme went onto positive outcomes".What,sanctions, foodbanks, economic inactive?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 08:34:11	@blacktriangle1 @boycottworkfare @ThirdForceNews having  volunteers is all good and well but using threatened unemployed is not on.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 08:36:10	@blacktriangle1 @boycottworkfare @ThirdForceNews I wonder how much CEOs get paid whilst unemployed are forced to work for nothing?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 08:46:39	@ZEPHYoRUS meanwhile in the ivory tower the financial year 2012/13, Oxfam's chief executive was paid £119,560
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 04:56:57	I wonder why @GaryBarlow would vote @Conservatives ? Could it be that the benefit cutting Tories support non doms and tax evaders? @the_tpa
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 07:04:16	@chunkymark @KailashChandOBE I heard a doctor on the Victoria Derbyshire show say that the NHS cannot suffer another 20 billion in cuts

456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 07:07:10	@chunkymark @KailashChandOBE economists state that during a recession you should spend and cut during a boom. Tories austerity is ideology.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 16:42:52	@SCrabb2015 @Byron_Davies crabby your a cock. I can say that because you never answer your tweets.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 16:46:03	@Jamin2g @boycottworkfare yes true but what's it gonna be @Conservatives or @UKLabour ? Vote Labour and get a left party SNPs (no pun)
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 16:50:23	My dream coalition, Labour, Respect, SNP, Greens and Plaid voting through left policies. 
What's yours?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 16:53:46	@MayaOppenheim voting for London must mean the financial city and property bubble. But not us peasants.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 17:14:41	@a479557099af42f yes I agree with you ;-) let's hope that Respect goes from strength to strength and becomes a large majority party.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 17:17:48	@a479557099af42f just imagine the love in the country between different faiths if George became PM.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-05 17:51:06	@TheGreenParty @jon_bartley @daily_politics yes and an income we can live on without using food banks using HP or loans at inflated interest
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-06 10:50:25	@SCrabb2015 @ICTFC go back to Scotland please. We don't want you in Pembrokeshire
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-06 10:52:49	@WelshConserv @SCrabb2015 you only get a better future with conservatives if you're a non dom, banster or millionaire
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-06 10:55:14	@PureMadAngel @ZEPHYoRUS @CareApps I strongly agree being a "service user" myself and having worked mental health
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-06 10:58:46	@cathalmono @chunkymark @acameraguy1 @OwenJones84 I agree. The government and media have successfully demonised sick, disabled, unemployed
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-06 13:17:56	@chunkymark @acameraguy1 @OwenJones84 Blair took Labour to the right to win last time. We can never let that happen again.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-07 09:51:37	@LifeInCMYK no because I'm doing the same. Or are we both wierd?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-07 09:54:48	@chunkymark yep because he hasn't killed off enough sick and disabled people yet #GE2015
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-07 09:57:19	@mattleys @chunkymark @LouiseMensch does she pay any British taxes?

456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-08 09:02:49	@georgegalloway  so sorry to hear the bad news.  Please don't leave politics.  We need your voice to be heard. Now more than ever.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-08 09:06:20	@boycottworkfare  I fear for our future. The NHS and welfare will be torn to shreds. More people will die, go hungry or homeless. Very sad.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-10 08:29:29	congrats to the #austerity protest and yes to those arrested, worth the price to gain publicity. The @Conservatives  will see much of this.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-10 08:43:56	#andrewMarr #austerity  the wealth creaters are not the owners of business but the customer or us the general public so lower VAT
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-10 08:50:45	#andrewMarr mandelson is wrong. Taking @UKLabour  to the right and ditching unions is bad news for uk as @theSNP  have shown
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-12 17:56:59	@SCrabb2015 @jennyranderson @walesoffice I wouldn't bother tweeting crabby Jenny because he never reads and replies anyway.

456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-14 10:00:31	@OwenJones84 @chunkymark @RooftopJaxx @Bunny_Carr  I disagree with you Bunny. Labour should not give it's values just to get into government
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-14 10:22:06	@Bunny_Carr @OwenJones84 @chunkymark @RooftopJaxx I agree and that was Blairs fault. So let's go left and represent unions and the workers
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-14 18:44:49	@rowand017 @chunkymark socialism for me
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-16 10:00:35	@StarbucksUK looks like you believe that there are special offers on paying taxes as well. I will never do business with criminals
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-16 10:17:10	@charlottechurch @jeweettog it reads"“bread and butter” ways of improving people’s lives."" Yeah like cutting our benefits,thanks so much
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-16 10:28:12	@chunkymark yep the @Conservatives  can't wait to cut benefits for the sick and disabled.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-16 10:31:41	@StradeyHotel any chance of a freebie mid week?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-15 13:38:07	@MayaOppenheim yes I reckon that there are quite a few fools out there
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-15 13:38:48	@MayaOppenheim oh and I thought talking on the tube was banned lol
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-18 10:26:01	@CutAusterity @AntiAusterityUK @AntiBedroomTax     how much is the benefit cap now?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-19 07:42:08	@YvetteCooperMP  stop calling business "wealth creators". It's the customers, particularly the middle class, who creates wealth.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-19 07:48:19	@StradeyHotel but think of the advertising.  Oh well, worth a try. Thanks for answering.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-19 07:58:19	@AndrewFisher79 @chunkymark @pcs_union what hope and inspiration did the @Conservatives  offer?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-19 08:01:21	@AndrewFisher79 @chunkymark @pcs_union I think offering a fairer society where business and individuals pay taxes is pretty inspirational
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-19 08:32:40	@OccupyLondon well if the NHS is wrecked the @Conservatives  can sell it off to their mates cheaper.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-20 07:30:31	@chunkymark well yeah its no surprise

456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-22 10:58:33	@Itchy_FooFoo @bbcquestiontime @OwenJones84 because we're in the eu and that has nothing to do with being left wing
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-23 10:11:47	@bankofengland  yeah right, it was an accident honest. Look people of Britain, in or out, it's all about what Goldman Sachs wants.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-23 10:17:20	@OwenJones84 I'm pretty much a socialist but I don't agree with same sex marriage. Just my beliefs and I don't want to upset anyone.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-23 10:18:54	@MilfordHavenNPT and stop crying wolf
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-23 10:30:27	@OwenJones84 yes true
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-23 10:40:25	@OwenJones84 but hold on, you're not going to have same sex marriage and you can support it so I should be able to voice my opinion right?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-23 17:40:10	@Anniehesketh @Shirehorse1 @OwenJones84 did I mention anything hateful?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-23 17:45:19	@LeftistLunatic because marriage has a religious aspect to it and what of forcing clergy togo against their beliefs. U now discriminate them
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-23 17:51:08	@OwenJones84 well that is a non sensible argument. We could use that for anything like if you didn't agree with bombing Iraq just ignore it
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-23 18:17:52	@LeftistLunatic I'm not against civil marriage in that case but let's see how long it is until religious church service is demanded
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-23 18:21:19	@OwenJones84 here is a better example. If you disagree with fox hunting then don't do it. I don't agree with hunting myself.

456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-24 12:01:54	@RedScareBot @Jacqueline_69 @OwenJones84 yes but now we have Christians and catholics crying that they are being discriminated against
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-24 12:05:18	@Jacqueline_69 @OwenJones84 this is my argument, by not discriminating one set of people you are now discriminating another
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-24 12:11:20	@Jacqueline_69 @OwenJones84 also you cannot put socialism in a box, people aren't like that. We have ideas and beliefs out side the box.

456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-25 09:21:43	@Teenage_Green @OwenJones84 I don't support Mormons stance, I'm not anti seg. Okay?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-25 09:26:42	@Teenage_Green @OwenJones84 I should be ashamed for giving some thought to peoples faith.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-25 09:30:06	@Teenage_Green @OwenJones84 no I don't support oppression and don't try to make me out to be someone I'm not.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-25 09:31:50	@Teenage_Green @OwenJones84 do I have an equal right to an opinion?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-25 09:33:56	@Teenage_Green @OwenJones84 gay marriage doesn't sit right with me. I didn't have a campaign against it just expressed my opinion
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-25 09:36:13	@Teenage_Green @OwenJones84 I'm not anti gay. I think you should maybe read some of my tweets before insulting me further
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-25 09:42:31	@Teenage_Green @OwenJones84 well Shihab it really has been nice to be demonised for daring to have an opinion but I need to have breakfast
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-26 09:00:42	Government guidance "Muslims who don't shop in Marks and Spencer could be radicalised". You couldn't make it up. I don't shop in MS its crap
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 09:24:25	@chunkymark this queen is still in charge of this country. She's asked if a government can be formed. Pm has to see her every week.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 09:27:55	@OccupyLondon yes the nasty party must first scrap human rights in order to carry out their brutal policies. Be afraid. Be very afraid.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 09:33:52	Time for a peasants revolt. The 1% and powerful wicked neo-cons use #QueensSpeech  to scrap our rights before the onslaught.Make voice heard
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 09:36:45	@Argos_Online does argos still abuse the unemployed in slave labour?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 09:39:13	@mclarke2410 @OwenJones84 yes and labour didn't make clear that they didn't cause the recession and money spent was good spending
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 09:40:46	@mclarke2410 @OwenJones84 also the time for cuts is during a boom. Government must spend during recession as the country will soon find out
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 09:42:09	@NickCWA @boycottworkfare @refuted yes Nick that's a very good point
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 09:44:21	@damienmgrant like all of my family, we don't like football
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 09:47:12	@damienmgrant Welsh. I do like sheep.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 09:51:06	#QueensSpeech  is that the house of Saud  a dictator sat with the rest of the criminals
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 09:52:38	@damienmgrant sounds like paradise, must visit some time
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 09:54:53	@damienmgrant that should keep you up all night. Enjoy
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 10:04:52	#QueensSpeech  so how many pedophiles are in the house of frauds (lords) today? And how many of them will get away with it?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 10:08:18	#QueensSpeech  one bomb could rid this country of the scum. Come back Guy Fawkes
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-28 10:09:10	So has the FBI arrested #FIFAarrests #FIFA officials in order to scupper Russians hosting of world cup? Anti Russian campaign
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-28 10:10:47	If USA had won the world cup bid would the fbi had arrested #FIFA  officials.  #FIFAarrests
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-28 10:20:34	@itvnews this is nothing more than the USA attempt to scupper Russian world cup. If USA had won the bid the fbi wouldn't be arresting
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 13:03:22	@BupaUK so how much tax payers money do you steal from the nhs?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 13:06:55	@JackDromeyMP they said they would protect the disabled but my Dla has reduced in real terms and unfair bed room taxes target disabled
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 13:17:27	#queensSpeech if the toffs really was a party of the workers then surely they would support unions.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-27 13:21:57	#QueensSpeech so now the  @Conservatives offer free child care. The @DWP  can crack the whip and force you back into work sooner
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-28 13:24:01	@csoghoian so along with our human rights our privacy is in jeopardy. Strange though that politicians work in the shadows in private.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-28 13:29:48	@RudyJB @chunkymark @Lewwww1234 I do hope that Mark isn't blaming the refugees. People are fleeing Libya cuz of the state Britain and USA
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-28 13:32:02	@RudyJB @chunkymark @Lewwww1234 left it in. Just like Iraq the fecking Americans and poodle brits murdered, destroyed then left.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-28 13:34:14	@chunkymark I feel sorry for the refugees and sod the bloody holiday makers. It's Britain and America fault that this is happening.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-28 13:36:57	@chunkymark hi Rudy. I wasn't too sure and maybe he could have pointed that out. Maybe I'm on the autistic spectrum somewhere, no pun.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-28 13:39:26	@BudBuddiesFan @csoghoian yes exactly. I did tweet yesterday during the queen thing in house of frauds, I wonder how many pedo's were there
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-28 13:46:02	@TeamGeorgeG @georgegalloway good luck George, go get em.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-28 13:54:45	@BudBuddiesFan @csoghoian here we go worth watching about government cover up  https://t.co/CkOPbhGxI9
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-29 10:41:07	@markrowantree @chunkymark @SonicNarcotic I want to move to a empathic fair country like Scotland.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-30 09:26:21	@chunkymark Yeh I aspire to be a rocket scientist only one problem, I'm think as shit.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-31 09:52:46	@JPonpolitics will you please falsely call business leaders as wealth creator's. It is the customer, mostly middle class, who creates wealth
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-01 19:46:45	@SellickLegal well we can't get legal aid anymore thanks to the rich tories, that's one change.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-01 19:54:02	@chunkymark well this refers to Denmark and I can't see this happening. I mean there will be riots and beheadings.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-31 13:31:31	@bbc5live have you noticed that many people involved with sports tend to start a sentence with "no" (inappropriately) or "but I mean"? Geez!
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-31 13:34:44	@MattCarr55 @OwenJones84 yeah they seem to think that going right (Blairite) will get them elected. Bad news for those on the breadline.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-05-31 13:42:12	@GuardianUS @ggreenwald well as we know the Bush family are a moral, fine standing all good American clan who are always truthful with
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-02 06:40:06	@chunkymark what The Sun newspaper? That always looks gloomy nowadays and that's not because of lack of tits, there are still many in there
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-02 06:41:59	@ggreenwald looks like Indians enjoy the same freedom of speech as Americans.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-02 06:44:15	@stevetopple @unemploymentmov but Steve,  anti austerity is about spending money.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-02 06:45:32	@jdportes @unemploymentmov @BBCNewsnight @CommunitiesUK @bbc5live @rachelburden the royal family look pretty troubled to me.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-02 06:47:15	@PRTuk @unemploymentmov give prisoners the vote. They are still British citizens living in Britain and paying taxes.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-02 09:34:00	@ThomasPride @DailyMailUK shame it wasn't Cameron.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-03 08:39:08	@chunkymark yeah I know it's a scandal. What kind of message does it send to the kids? if you cheat you win? Flipping cheating dog ffs
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-03 09:02:36	@chunkymark to be fair some of us are struggling to live on benefits but yes I support you're cause.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-03 09:53:05	@chunkymark @jamesdoleman well what do you expect? Those at the top are just like the mafia, they are untouchable.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-02 11:45:04	@nja5 @chunkymark well yeah the rich and privileged need to keep the peasants poor so all our effort is in surviving and not class progress
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-03 11:35:39	#PMQs the claimant count may have lowered but how many of them people are sanctioned or can't claim as their partner earns £100pw on 0hours
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-03 11:41:12	@chunkymark yes a great Tshit and I would love to have it. However because of the swear word nobody can wear without fear of being arrested
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-02 06:14:38	Sorry to hear about Charles. Although I didn't agree with everything he said but I think he was an okay kinda guy.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-02 06:17:00	@OwenJones84 it's a shame on Westminster that the majority didn't follow his lead on Iraq.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-02 06:23:31	@RaniaKhalek so not content with taking Palestinian farm land and homes they now steal their fishing boats.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-03 12:27:10	@chunkymark I pledge £20 next Tuesday 9th June when I get my dla. Don't let me forget.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-02 17:13:33	#FIFA now watch Russia lose their world cup hosting.  Well done america and their british puppets for yet again having a go at Russia.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-02 17:54:09	@EveningHarold  breaking news- Capita taking over #FIFA  presidency. Unemployed building football stadia as work experience
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-02 18:07:49	#CharlesKennedy yes Duncan Smith Charles was a decent and thoughtful man. Unlike you you murdering basterd.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 19:18:31	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark so do you expect landlord's to charge less for people on benefits? What you will achieve is a lack of housing
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 19:57:29	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark this is exactly what the tories want. They make cuts to housing benefit and you blame the landlord's?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 20:41:26	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark I agree with you there but it was the tories who cut HB and sell off social housing. Not landlord fault
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 20:43:41	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark do you want landlords to cut rent? What would happen if the tories then reduced HB again? This is tory  ideology
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 20:46:24	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark it's the lack of housing that drives up rent. Supply and demand.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 20:49:09	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark do you think a landlord is going to push up price of rent and price himself out of the market?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 20:51:29	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark so it's the landlord's fault that the tories have cut housing benefit?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 20:54:43	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark should we now expect to have free legal representation from lawyer's because the government have cut legal aid?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 20:56:50	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark you people are barking up the wrong tree. I agree there are bad greedy landlord's but tories cut HB
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-03 16:27:08	@BBCBreaking well Andy Coulsdon DID lie in court under oath.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 20:59:05	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark and where does all the mortgage interest go? The banks. Yes if you pay for something then you don't get money back
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 21:01:08	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark social housing is missing off your chart Mark. People do live in council housing ect
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 21:03:10	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark yes and all the money would still go to the landlord. Would you complain if there was no cuts to HB?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 21:06:21	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark yes it was Thatcher who started the whole avalanche. Right to buy and no housing stock to replace it. Privatisation.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 21:12:43	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark ah I don't read that crap lol but it is a problem with the money going to Tennants bank rather than landlord
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 21:14:08	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark it's a bit hard to pay the landlord whilst you're children are going hungry
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 21:14:55	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark the tories have pushed tenants into debt
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 21:17:01	@@HelenP3617 nice chatting to you. It's time for me meds then bed. Take care nn
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 21:18:47	@HelenP3617 @chunkymark question time on soon
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-03 20:16:06	@scrabbmp @Craig4CardiffN city deals for g4s and capita no doubt.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-05 09:20:17	@MadcatRomany @HelenP3617 @chunkymark yes they may have more money temporarily before handing more over for rent.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-05 09:21:35	@MadcatRomany @HelenP3617 @chunkymark however if you have no gas and electricity or your kids are crying because they are hungry it's ....
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-05 09:23:25	@MadcatRomany @HelenP3617 @chunkymark ....tempting not to pay the rent then get a huge interest loans so not to be evicted
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 07:31:01	@EmilyMaiden @OwenJones84 and you can say the same with this one action.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 07:39:01	@chunkymark tories cut a service so bad that it fails then hails the private sector as it takes over.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 08:31:23	@reedcouk also you shouldn't mention that you have been on the work programme, work fair or any other form of slavery.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 08:35:42	@reedcouk advice from so called "job coaches" is not to mention your hard worked degree when forced to apply for a unskilled "job".
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 13:37:09	@WTelegraph Stephen crabby should sort this out as it's his fault that vulnerable people are starving in Pembrokeshire.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 13:40:13	@MatchroomBoxing @scrabbmp @leeselby126 @AlunCairns hey crabby vulnerable people are starving in Pembrokeshire due to you tories.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-04 13:45:10	@OwenJones84 yeah he's probably complaining that the richest 10% haven't as much wealth as the richest 1%
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-06 09:13:30	@MadcatRomany @HelenP3617 @chunkymark RoCat no my friend, the ConDems changed it saying individuals should have more responsibility
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-06 09:16:23	@Conservatives will the PM start with corruption in the city and send people to prison?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-06 09:18:37	@Jeremy_Hunt @Conservatives but you cut care in the community which causes huge problems with NHS. pass the buck to local government.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-06 09:20:50	@chunkymark @mrjohnsalmon United States maybe
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-06 16:56:48	@chunkymark I've pledged £20 on Tuesday m8
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-06 16:59:27	@VodafoneUK @onedirection @Meghan_Trainor @official_flo what about your tax avoidance performance? http://t.co/4Oid3QpcVa
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-08 09:52:15	@chunkymark Soames the grandson of Winston Churchill father in law a lord. Went to Eaton. Yeah their all in it together.

456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-09 07:26:08	@HomeLet what's the number of social housing bought buy to let with inflated rent? Another words more expensive than social housing rent
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-09 07:34:57	@hangbitch this is shocking news. Will a "work coach" have training in mental health? We need a petition on this issue, this is serious
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-09 07:40:55	#HSBC good bye to bad news. Now watch the tories lower bank levy. The tax payers bend over and feel the pain while banks break the law
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-10 06:56:11	@Red_Rescue @boycottworkfare get on your bike.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-10 06:58:47	@chunkymark happy birthday. It was mine on the 8th June but I don't like to advertise it lol
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-10 11:06:55	@Red_Rescue @boycottworkfare I was being sarcastic m8.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-10 11:11:00	@Red_Rescue @boycottworkfare yes that's why I said it. I could just imagine a work coach coming out with some crap like that.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-10 11:15:16	@Red_Rescue @boycottworkfare yeah it's disgusting how they treat vulnerable people. They have blood on their hands.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-12 13:22:20	@YvetteCooperMP so you care about the unions all of a sudden?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-13 11:57:53	@hannahjames40 @reedcouk because this is what the job centre tell you. Your less likely to gain employment.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-13 12:09:47	@hannahjames40 @reedcouk oh well it hasn't happened to you so it must be bs. I've read different on forums but they must be lies.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-13 12:14:48	@hannahjames40 @reedcouk I won't take your advice thanks. Seems like you're the one with an agenda. Bye bye
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-15 11:28:45	Why would a free and moral democratic country need spies? They wouldn't unless they've pissed a few people off.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-16 06:16:32	It's clear that Cameron/Obama didn't murder Gaddafi to save the people of #Libya because they have left a country at war and people drown
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-16 06:57:59	@Independent what you need is a world war to thin out the peasants.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-16 07:01:05	@SWidowsAdviser only for those who are rich and or a politician. Next those with private pension scheme will have reduced state pension.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-16 07:13:38	@OccupyLondon the poo will hit the fan when there is a low/middle skilled workers famine to keep London functioning.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-18 10:31:25	@AldiCareersUK what's the pay like?
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-18 10:36:05	@Reportingclimat @ZEPHYoRUS yeah it's my fault because I drove a mile in my diesel car to the shops this morning.
456523609	sherhayward	2015-06-18 10:47:03	@WTelegraph not a surprise is it? Like who would have thought jumping off cliffs and rocks into the sea would be dangerous?
