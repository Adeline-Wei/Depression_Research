Eg: Having wealth with health to enjoy it.
Having wealth w/o health is not it.
46838244	satselva	2014-05-18 03:19:07	Being #Successful = Having the ability to write ur own #success story precisely the way u wanted it!

46838244	satselva	2014-05-18 03:12:17	Succeeding = Having what u want w/o the context of what u want.
Many of us experience this all the time.
Eg: Wealth w/o #health to enjoy it.
46838244	satselva	2014-05-18 03:14:16	"Succeeding" happens to most human beings.
#Failure = Once in a while getting what u want w/o the context of what u want.
#Nithyananda #Life
46838244	satselva	2014-05-18 03:17:44	Being #Successful = Knowing the #Science to repeat and get what u want in the context that u wanted!
#Nithyananda #Celebrate #Powerful #Life
46838244	satselva	2014-05-18 03:25:13	Default #Mind = Patterns that you #create in moments of "succeeding"!
Default mind leads to "#failure" as it is not repeatable!
#Nithyananda
46838244	satselva	2014-05-18 03:32:07	Being #Successful happens when u study the #science of #success and remove all the blind spots that caused "succeeding".

With continuous awareness, the pattern ridden #mind can be dissolved into Him!
46838244	satselva	2014-05-22 04:21:57	The #Human #body is a mirror that reflects #Consciousness.
Reflection in default #female body happens at spleen chakra - #fear, #insecurity!
46838244	satselva	2014-05-22 04:25:29	The context of a vedic #marriage is the #commitment they take for each others' #enlightenment!
The spouse reflects the patterns to complete!

For common people, an #authentic mind needs to be built to move to no mind state!
46838244	satselva	2014-07-01 04:38:12	@KrishnaDharma Views that create this type of thinking are incompletions!

Heaviness is metaphysical!

Weight = #body mass.
Heaviness = mass of incompletions.

#Advaitha = antidote to heaviness!

Apasmara can be destroyed only by the #word of the #Guru / Master.
#Nithyananda
46838244	satselva	2014-07-02 05:13:34	Apasmara = thought that binds us with the cognition "i am #body" "i am #mind"
#Nithyananda #Celebrate #Powerful #Life
46838244	satselva	2014-07-02 05:17:17	Cognition that i am #body / #mind is like a tornado (temporary phenomenon).
Mind makes us believe that this is permanent!
#Nithyananda #Life
46838244	satselva	2014-07-02 05:20:55	Believing the #mind is to give up and jump from one tornado to another.
This avoids me from experiencing my real #nature.

It takes a moment 4 Krishna to reveal His supremacy!
46838244	satselva	2014-07-02 13:46:43	The folly of Root Pattern (Bhisma) has to be revealed to itself for it to be vanquished.
Then tattvas (Pandavas) can destroy other patterns!
46838244	satselva	2014-07-05 05:59:59	#Education = Awareness of blind spots in a field.
Making one aware of the blind spots in their #body, #mind &amp; spirit is Spiritual Education!

#Nithyananda
46838244	satselva	2015-05-14 06:30:09	The system which empowers you in the waking state is #logic; in the #emotion state, is #Love; in conscious state it is Advaita.

46838244	satselva	2015-05-13 14:52:47	Collapsing law of life on flow of #life leads to tiredness &amp; boredom.
