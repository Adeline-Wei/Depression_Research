479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-04-30 23:20:42	Can't believe some of the Utd fans on here, apparently we can still the league because Alan pardew and fergie are friends...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-04-30 23:22:00	So Newcastle will get a point against city, not because they want to get into europe but because pardew will want to help out his mate?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-04-30 23:22:41	Never heard so much rubbish in all my life, we were 8pts clear and we fucked it up. Game over!

479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-01 11:11:32	@Planet_Footba11 I won't be giving you abuse btw, you seem to know what your talking about. Just hope you're right, how confident are you?

479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-01 19:25:58	@1andOnlyWalshy doesn't actually confirm it though, Uniteds website just post what the papers are saying not that they're true
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-01 19:43:48	@1andOnlyWalshy I'm not doubting that we watched him just saying utd's website post all paper gossip, love him to come here but I think&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-01 19:44:27	@1andOnlyWalshy he's city bound, papers saying he prefers city because they can offer regular football, although I can't see how they can.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-01 20:04:23	@1andOnlyWalshy yeah I know, said because city only have Johnson as a wide player he would get in the team but yet city don't deploy width

479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-07 14:41:09	@paulbienkowski most papers have been saying pretty much the same. We shall see what hazard really wants come the transfer window.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-07 15:06:13	@paulbienkowski I know they gain a few thousand followers and then feck off when the transfer windows over haha

479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 16:18:37	@dannyh9623 @sonja_coryat @benno_luhg @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy haven't got a clue what he's on about? Torture? Religious? Normal?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 16:21:05	Got a letter with a love film 3for1 month voucher but it says it expires on the 24/04/12? The little teases!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 16:28:35	Anyone know someone that speaks fluent Italian, need something translating for a tattoo?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 16:30:11	@Benno_LUHG @dannyh9623 @sonja_coryat @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy we were talking about hazard and that was his reply?feckin fruitcake
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 16:53:56	@rajeshnair112 @marion1100 kagawa isn't good? I've heard it all now!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 17:10:07	@rajeshnair112 @marion1100 did I at any point say he was a game changer? To say he isn't good is ridiculous! He's carried BVB all season!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 17:21:19	@marion1100 @rajeshnair112 don't worry patrick I'm talking to the other delinquent who thinks shinji kagawa isn't good.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 17:23:19	@demilovesjoey @t3zzzy not to be nasty but you do know half caste is a derogatory term for someone with dual heritage meaning half pure?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 17:25:10	@rajeshnair112 @marion1100 not a big fan of him just appreciate the quality of player he is. Would Be a good buy for utd :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 17:28:07	@marion1100 @rajeshnair112 he's only going to cost 10mil at the most because his contract runs out next year, carried BVB all season and &gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 17:28:56	@marion1100 @rajeshnair112 they haven't missed Mario goetze as much as they thought they would.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 17:29:58	@iHateReece I love it! Tartan out of respect for Fergie.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 17:48:48	@rajeshnair112 @marion1100 I'm not arsed I we buy him or not my argument was he is a good player. 13 goals and 8 assists in 31 games and &gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 17:49:27	@rajeshnair112 @marion1100 David silva has 6 goals and 14 assists in 35 games, he is a silva/mata type player
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 17:58:51	@rajeshnair112 @marion1100 fergie will buy atleast 3 players this summer. He has very quick feet and close ball control, very underrated.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 18:04:41	@rajeshnair112 @marion1100 think if he gets kagawa he'll go for a more holding mid to help Carrick he'll probably play 4-2-3-1 more aswell.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 18:05:29	@rajeshnair112 check this video to get more of an idea on kagawa http://t.co/RxZ2lWs5
Very silva like player.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 18:16:02	@rajeshnair112 no I think he'll add that something we lack, he also fits into our budget. We aren't going to spend heavily on one player.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 18:21:02	@rajeshnair112 bundesliga is the closest to premier league there is. It would be risky to spend 30mil on hazard who is only proven in &gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 18:21:13	@rajeshnair112 a very weak French league
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 18:23:16	@rajeshnair112 Anderson is also played out of position and fergie put him in a more defensive role which is why he hasn't been at his best
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 18:27:06	@rajeshnair112 city have the money to take that chance on him. Look at berbatov 30mil, he didn't work out and he was PL proven.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 18:34:50	@rajeshnair112 Anderson plays better when he doesn't have to worry about his defensive duties. Could possibly play rooneys role better.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 18:43:29	@rajeshnair112 he played that role at Porto and did it very well. He just came here and got fat like most brazilians do
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 18:44:32	@RobRuggio Do you speak fluent Italian? Need something translating if you don't mind?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 19:09:32	@RobRuggio any chance u can follow me so I can DM it you, need it translating for a tattoo :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 19:27:33	@RobRuggio thank you :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 19:46:25	@MUFC_83 depends, some make your hair very greasy or very dull looking.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 20:13:54	@MUFC_83 I'm big your small, I'm right your wrong and there's nothing you can do about it. Always worked in Matilda.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-09 01:16:36	@FreddieBoswell7 Are united definitely out of the race for hazard or could they still get him?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-09 16:04:52	Anyone know any good tattoo places in Manchester?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-10 22:16:28	@Hende_11 no they don't you divvy, everyone else wants proof and u can't give it them. I will apologise if I'm wrong but can't see it tbf.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-10 22:22:25	@marion1100 why u so bothered about people following and unfollowing you?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-10 22:39:41	@marion1100 less of the cap locks. Tell people this then, the only thing that comes across to your followers is that u want to be popular&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-10 22:40:22	@marion1100 not that you are doing it for a good cause. I think unfollowing people isn't the end of the world.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-10 22:43:56	@marion1100 it's Bianca you tool not biamce. Put in your bio somewhere that u are doing it for a good cause no one wants to follow someone&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-10 22:44:33	@marion1100 who complains about being unfollowed but doesn't explain why. You look like you are in a popularity contest.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-10 22:49:36	This @marion1100 is an absolute toss pot, can't take criticism even when it's constructive!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-04-28 01:44:59	Serkan Canlier trying to add me on FB nothing on his wall, no info, no photos and no mutual friends! How do they find me to add me? #fuckoff
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-04-28 01:49:11	Baffles me as to how they manage to friend request me, I mean did he get bored and just randomly search Bianca to see what comes up?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-04-28 01:52:24	My name isn't really that common and not a generic name that would cross your mind to search unless you were watching #eastenders
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-07 14:39:30	@paulbienkowski yeah I know and I don't usually believe twitter crap. He's just stating what both teams are offering him. Then again&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-07 14:46:59	@paulbienkowski I know it's full of apparent 'ITK' haha United of course :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:16:01	@corrienationstr @benno_luhg @1andonlywalshy tbf though ligue 1 doesn't finish til may 20 and England play Belgium on June 2 so it's not &gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:16:52	@corrienationstr @benno_luhg @1andonlywalshy as if it's that long between them both, June is only 3 weeks away.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:25:52	@dannyh9623 @benno_luhg @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy thing is hazard isn't allowed to agree anything til after ligue 1 is finished &gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:26:41	@dannyh9623 @benno_luhg @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy it's only about 2 weeks between that and our friendly. We will step up our &gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:27:17	@dannyh9623 @benno_luhg @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy interest in them 2 weeks if things go well ferguson will be going to the friendly &gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:27:34	@dannyh9623 @benno_luhg @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy to wrap things up not just watch him again
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:31:35	@Benno_LUHG @dannyh9623 @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy rudi Garcia has said nothing is allowed to be done til after ligue 1 has finished
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:36:40	@Benno_LUHG @dannyh9623 @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy younes belhanda apparently, Brian marwood is limiting mancinis money because of FFP
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:41:55	@marion1100 no problem :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:43:58	@dannyh9623 @benno_luhg @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy looks pretty good, plays for Montpelier. Very similar to hazard just not as hyped.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:52:40	@dannyh9623 @benno_luhg @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy not sure, quite a few teams are looking at him including liverpoo and PSG &gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:53:13	@dannyh9623 @benno_luhg @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy although his price tag is only supposed to be 7mil so he could be worth a punt.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:57:15	@dannyh9623 most people dont like it but I quite like the idea of tartan on the kit.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:58:39	@dannyh9623 @benno_luhg @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy I don't see how he's gonna get regular football but money talks I suppose &gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:59:17	@dannyh9623 @benno_luhg @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy his agent did say in jan though he wouldn't go to a club where hes paid more &gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 15:59:36	@dannyh9623 @benno_luhg @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy but played less, let's hope they stick to their guns!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 16:05:54	@dannyh9623 @benno_luhg @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy yeah defo, prob get a free role at united like ronaldo did. Fergie is the key!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-08 16:09:14	@dannyh9623 @benno_luhg @corrienationstr @1andonlywalshy if he joins city I hope flops more than dzeko did haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-09 18:49:01	@dannyh9623 fuck the lot of them and let's sign balboa instead, he'd bring steel to our midfield! Haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-09 20:31:32	Don't know whether to buy FIFA 12 on Xbox or ps3
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-09 22:31:53	@Benno_LUHG muniain was brilliant as usual, was still playing like he could win it at 3-0 down and 4 mins to go. Martinez was solid as per!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-09 22:37:56	@corrienationstr @benno_luhg spurs won't go in for him anyway assou-ekotto won't leave.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-09 22:41:40	@Benno_LUHG I have both but sick to death of the Xbox, ps3 is winning it for me at the minute x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-09 22:47:46	@corrienationstr @benno_luhg Evra is having a mare though and if he's kept he'll probably be used on the left wing. Defensively he's shit!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-09 22:51:08	@Benno_LUHG didn't really see first half but second half he played in the middle and did a pretty good job at it
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-09 22:52:36	@Benno_LUHG muniain and gaitan definitely, I'd even just have muniain on his own over hazard.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-10 13:07:30	@sonnyclay @dannyh9623 yes I am :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-10 14:11:34	@Hende_11 @corrienationstr are we waiting for someone to photoshop this picture or something?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-12 00:18:56	It's embarrassing watching Julia stiles dance in save the last dance #NoRhythm
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-17 15:11:47	@RichardDelile how reliable is your source? Hope you're right
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-17 18:27:15	@SteJones00 @1andonlywalshy hazard is sponsored by Nike though so it probably means nothing.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-17 20:07:51	@1andOnlyWalshy These rumours for 45mil have to be as a package, hazards buy out clause is 33 so why would they pay 45?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-17 20:16:49	@1andOnlyWalshy I'm sure his buy out clause is 33mil euros, even if it wasn't surely 45mil euros is more than £33mil
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-17 21:52:52	Chris martins voice gives me goosebumps!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-18 00:30:03	@JamesProctor28 we'd get fucked up with that formation hazard can't play in a 2 man midfield, doesn't track back enough.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-18 00:41:10	@JamesProctor28 ah I see, I'd play 4231 with Carrick maybe fletch in the 2, hazard, kagawa, Nani in the 3 (wishful thinking) haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-18 00:56:00	These girls on sex, lies &amp; rinsing guys have no morals or any kind of conscience whatsoever. #UtterBitches
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 18:00:54	Takes fucking ages for http://t.co/ODlb8lJK to get his words out #TheVoiceUK
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 19:44:30	@GeraldGeeO Chelsea have been the worst team to watch in the CL, every man behind the ball and then just work on the counter attack.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 20:36:12	One thing I didn't want was extra time, I'm fooking starving!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 21:32:28	Have I really just seen bad boy II tattooed onto Contento's arm?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 22:35:31	David price is a beast of a man!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 23:12:04	@AwesomeRoberts that's not what u starting off saying, u said he would get knocked out and that was because ur a Manc and he's scouse
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 23:30:21	Where do you find punk? In my sheets hahaha #KevinAndPerry
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 23:34:30	@AwesomeRoberts he will do now, u have to gain experience before getting in the ring with a well experienced pro.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 23:39:37	@AwesomeRoberts I never said he was anything special, I said he's better than fury which really isn't that hard :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 23:50:52	@AwesomeRoberts the standard of heavy weight boxers has dropped drastically, non of these boxers would last 2mins in the Tyson era
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 23:55:37	@AwesomeRoberts I hope you're joking lol granted, Lennox Lewis beat him but never in a million years was Tyson shit.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 00:00:06	@AwesomeRoberts yeah course he cheated but was a mint fighter, you're not gonna tell me u hated Ali aswell are u? Haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 00:08:35	@AwesomeRoberts and agian we agree on something haha have u seem the senna movie?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 00:11:55	@AwesomeRoberts haha 'our Nige' like you's were best mates
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 00:19:06	@AwesomeRoberts you don't really get that with any people in the public eye, most think they're above everyone else
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 00:20:28	You are not my mate, you are no longer my fellow DJ 

Hahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 00:21:21	@AwesomeRoberts Hamilton seems very grounded and has not forgotten where he came from, I'd love footballers to do the same :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 00:27:06	@AwesomeRoberts exactly, I would quite happily play for an average working class wage which is pretty much what women footballers get anyway
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 00:31:38	@AwesomeRoberts yeah I would tbf, played football a lot when I was younger. Okie doke night :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:47:23	@rajeshnair112 very different case, rooneys red card will not leave England playing with 10 men in the group stages, Terry's red card did.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:51:21	@rajeshnair112 yes exactly he can be replaced, JT couldn't be replaced at that game leaving 10men on the pitch in a crucial game
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:08:20	@rajeshnair112 an injury is different that wouldn't be his fault, kneeing someone deliberately and getting a red card is his fault.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:12:09	@rajeshnair112 campaign yes, if Chelsea had gone out to barca in the semi, terry would get the blame for leaving 10men to defend
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:20:47	@source_football tbf you're one of the only apparent itk's I have believed on here.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:23:08	@rajeshnair112 course it's legal I never said it wasnt, my first tweet was he didn't deserve it and he has no class otherwise he would&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:23:31	@rajeshnair112 accept he played no part in that final therefore doesn't warrant the medal.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:25:12	@rajeshnair112 yes I know that I can't change rules, simply saying JT doesn't deserve the medal he could have fucked everything up for them
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:26:59	@rajeshnair112 yes and if barca had of beat Chelsea, everyone else's hard work would have gone to waste because he can't keep his cool.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:43:21	@rajeshnair112 yet again missing a penalty is different to deliberately kneeing someone and being sent off! M.O is also different&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:51:31	@rajeshnair112 I didn't say that I said if u are irresponsible enough to jeopardise ur teams chances u don't deserve anything.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:58:26	@rajeshnair112 I don't hate anyone, the club doesn't have to remove them they did that all by themselves by getting a red card.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 19:00:54	@rajeshnair112 now ur just taking it to extremes why would they sack a player for getting a red card?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-21 08:33:34	@source_football his manager said he changed his mind a few weeks ago, Chelsea only won the CL 2 days ago? Think he'll still join utd?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-13 13:43:24	Vincent kompany looks like he should be in southpark!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-13 16:00:22	What a day of football it has been today! Pure madness!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-21 15:19:54	@shartnett91 BBC are reporting it too on here
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-10 20:45:51	@Hende_11 @calvinc88 because he's pulling your leg sunshine!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-10 21:08:30	@Hende_11 how long have u been saying be patient for now? Is your mate still in his meeting? WUM
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-10 21:23:45	@Hende_11 you've not given us anything to believe, just a few words that any other person could have said.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-14 08:43:42	@1andOnlyWalshy can't see them both coming, haven't them two been arguing at BVB. Rather have kagawa and hummels
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-22 15:54:35	@corrienationstr why doesn't it sound good?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-22 16:29:20	@corrienationstr yeah things changed in the last few weeks Chelsea only won the CL 3 days ago. Could have changed his mind from city to utd
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-22 16:31:12	@stevecliff1 June 1st I think, not completely sure though.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-22 16:39:10	@corrienationstr it's not a genuine Lille twitter account I don't think.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-22 17:29:46	@JamieAlexTimes and why the hell would lilles head of PR be texting you. WUM
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-23 13:34:12	@Benno_LUHG his agent has said he's agreed terms with all 3 of us, I think we're in for him haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-14 19:45:19	@Benno_LUHG that quote was a mis-interpretation by the English media because part of the sentence can be used for 'anyway' or 'definitely'
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-24 16:19:00	@source_football do u think he will join united or just that he would prefer it?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-18 19:50:01	This affair thing with sunita on #corrie makes my skin crawl!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-15 17:34:11	@dannyh9623 @1andonlywalshy read the second part of his tweet Danny :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-15 20:59:06	@corrienationstr no it isn't he's already said his decision is 90% made so he obviously knows where he wants to go
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-15 21:27:10	@Benno_LUHG which journos this?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-25 08:51:26	@source_football only stupid people believe his shit, deletes tweets and says concluded instead of done deal to cover his arse if it fails.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 19:38:47	Most boring first half of a CL final I've seen. Need Bayern to score so Chelsea actually step outside their own 18 yard box!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 20:15:42	Have I been pronouncing Toni Kroos' name wrong all this time or are the commentators pronouncing it wrong tonight?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 20:41:31	@GeraldGeeO I'd take him at united on a free without a doubt!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-16 21:38:49	@corrienationstr that just says 'all the English are asking if hazard is signing for man u but I am not his agent.'
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-16 21:40:44	@corrienationstr @dannyh9623 he didn't say he wanted him to join, someone said man utd fans adore him he said 'I know I know' then the guy &gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-16 21:41:27	@corrienationstr @corrienationstr he is a player that united need and his reply was 'it has come'
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-17 00:14:27	@1andOnlyWalshy @jamesproctor28 the good thing with the quote 'il a venir' is that even though 'il's direct translation would be it however&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-17 00:16:12	@1andOnlyWalshy @jamesproctor28 in this case it would mean 'he' when we did French in school we always used il for a boy and elle for a &gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-17 00:17:22	@1andOnlyWalshy @jamesproctor28 girl if I remember rightly, with the context of that quote he would have been saying he has come.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-17 00:37:15	@JamesProctor28 @1andonlywalshy he tweeted that after ur convo, just a bit of optimism but who's to say he didn't know he wasnt supposed&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-17 00:37:31	@JamesProctor28 @1andonlywalshy to tell anyone and is now trying to make out he doesn't know?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-26 17:48:59	@Clare_29 don't think he said he actually wants the number 10 he just wants to play that role, media twisting things again
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-17 14:51:39	@corrienationstr we'll have more than that, berba will go probably Anderson, kzusack, maybe park. These will all reduce wage bill aswell.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-17 16:08:26	@JamesProctor28 Baines left back and Evra as back up for the left wing.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-17 16:28:16	@JamesProctor28 Evra's preferred position is on the wing, Monaco put him at left back because they had wingers. He isn't great defensively.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-17 17:57:56	@reddevil2695 hazard is sponsored by Nike though and city will be in the 13/14 season.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 22:39:48	@AwesomeRoberts nah my money's on price tonight
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 22:46:41	@AwesomeRoberts no fury wouldn't fight price because apparently he's moving onto another level which is why sexton is fighting price instead
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 22:51:57	@AwesomeRoberts fury will get beat by klitschko, fury can't box for shit just has a long reach
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 22:53:28	@AwesomeRoberts he's technically better than fury though
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 22:55:45	@AwesomeRoberts that doesn't change the fact he's technically better than fury. Price has very quick hands.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 23:03:26	@AwesomeRoberts He'll fight people eventually that are 'good'. Whatever way we dance round this, price is better than fury.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 23:06:36	@AwesomeRoberts you also thought price would get knocked out tonight lol
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 23:07:56	@AwesomeRoberts I am too but u can't deny someone's talent because of where they came from.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 23:12:59	@AwesomeRoberts automatically defended fury because he's a manc, truth is heavy weight boxers aren't as good as they were years ago.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 23:15:00	@AwesomeRoberts I didn't exactly say he was a world beater did I, I stated he would beat sexton and he's better than fury.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 23:17:48	@AwesomeRoberts he's not fought him yet so you can't really argue that point til they have.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 23:24:58	@AwesomeRoberts so if chisora beat price and price beat fury does that still make fury better in ur eyes? Price is the better fighter. I &gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 23:25:26	@AwesomeRoberts don't really believe the daily mail but Powell is definitely one for the future.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-19 23:28:49	@AwesomeRoberts he wanted to but fury refused coz hes moving onto the next level, probs gonna piss u off more but don't rate Haye either lol
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 00:04:23	@AwesomeRoberts agree with you 100% on this one, never admired a boxer as much as him and it was sad to see his disease take over his life.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 12:50:25	@1andOnlyWalshy Do u think bob cass is playing it safe after feeling the wrath of fergie when he revealed his intentions on sneijder? &gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 12:51:04	@1andOnlyWalshy He said its not city but take ur pick from utd, spurs, chels. We all no hazard said he's going Manchester.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 12:55:51	@corrienationstr I wouldn't worry about it, hazard has said hes going Manchester. The only reason they've mentioned Chelsea is cos of CL win
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 13:02:14	@corrienationstr he wouldn't rule out the rest of the country by saying Manchester if there was a chance of going to London. Anyway I'd &gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 13:02:35	@corrienationstr rather he chose Chelsea than city if we don't get him haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 14:56:46	@AwesomeRoberts haha he'll be driving round the ring road all season trying to find the club he's gonna join.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 14:59:25	@AwesomeRoberts he'll end up in Warrington, that's where I always end up when I get on a motorway, absolutely clueless without a satnav haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 15:48:15	@source_football saying someone wants to join and someone actually joining are very different.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 15:54:45	@source_football no what I'm saying is I could say hazard wants to join united and if he doesn't say I'm sorry the deal fell through. Don't&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 15:55:27	@source_football get me wrong I hope you're right I'm just saying someone wanting to sign is very different from him agreeing to join.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 15:56:48	@1andOnlyWalshy myp2p generally have about 5 links in their website for big games try that at 8.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 16:47:42	Geoff shreeves must be having a giraffe on that last tweet!! JT deserves nothing
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 16:53:38	Berbatov has more class in his right foot than the whole of Citeh's football club!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 16:58:56	@rajeshnair112 JT has no class, you have to play in the final to warrant the medal. Have a look at scholes and Keane in 99 #PureClass
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 16:59:42	@Clare_29 he's definitely using premier league as a stepping stone. Madrid is his dream club apparently.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:03:42	@rajeshnair112 I'm saying they don't deserve the medal they did absolutely nothing in the final to help win it. To take a medal from (1/2)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:04:35	@rajeshnair112 (2/2) the hard work of other players is ridiculous! Scholes an Keane don't count their medal from 99 because they didn't play
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:09:14	@rajeshnair112 so the fact he jeopardised their chance in the semi an left 10 men defending for their lives against barca, deserves a medal?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:12:00	@Clare_29 exactly, Ronaldo came to united as a humble 17yr old ready to learn from SAF. Hazard thinks he's already up there with the best!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:14:24	@rajeshnair112 as I said JT jeopardised their chance in the semi by leaving 10 men to defend for their lives against barca.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:16:04	@rajeshnair112 you actually believe it was by accident he blatantly kneed alexis in his back! no reason to do it but the fact he lost his it
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:17:54	@rajeshnair112 him missing a penalty is different to losing your head in a crucial game and leaving your team mates to do your job!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:19:50	@rajeshnair112 you are honestly deluded if u can watch that back and say he did it by accident. Lost his head in a big game yet again.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:22:09	@rajeshnair112 exactly and they don't deserve anything, they put their team in jeopardy. Hence why Keane and scholes don't count their medal
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:23:04	@rajeshnair112 if its not an accident it's deliberate there's no inbetween.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:29:59	@rajeshnair112 I mean anything in life, if you dont do it by accident course it's deliberate. Deliberate means doing it with intention.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:35:01	@rajeshnair112 it was Sanchez. He deliberately kicked him no mis-timing in that challenge.Being a goal down is easier to come back from(1/2)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:35:38	@rajeshnair112 (2/2) then defending against a team like barca with 10men
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:41:04	@rajeshnair112 I never said he did it to see his team lose, I said he jeopardised his teams chance therefore doesn't deserve a medal.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:55:54	@rajeshnair112 yes, and if England get through the group stages he will not get any credit because he didn't play same with JT in the final
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 17:59:07	@rajeshnair112 no the fact he didn't think about anyone else but himself in that game and left his team mates to do his job(1/2)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:00:04	@rajeshnair112 (2/2) he will get credit for games he played in but didn't contribute to that final so by putting a kit on and celebrating&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:00:17	@rajeshnair112 like he did proves how classless he is
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:01:56	@corrienationstr he'll be midway through his game how is he going to do that?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:06:04	@corrienationstr yeah fair enough was just asking
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:07:19	@rajeshnair112 I said he will get credit for games he played, but to try and take credit for what 11 other men did last night is ridiculous
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:16:36	@rajeshnair112 where did I say it's illegal he collected his medal I said he didn't derserve it. Chelsea could have been knocked out cos of&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:17:58	@rajeshnair112 him. He should have put a suit on and accepted he played no part in winning that final but instead he wanted to be able to&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:18:15	@rajeshnair112 say he's won a CL medal.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:19:25	@rajeshnair112 yes and if we had won them games Evans nor Vidic would get any credit. Fergie even said Evans should have let balotelli&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:19:50	@rajeshnair112 score because ya much easier to come back from one nil down with 11 men then with 10 men.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:32:39	@rajeshnair112 you are clueless. JT played no part in the last 2 games but still deserves to take credit from what other players did?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:44:16	@rajeshnair112 he was chosen when and if needed by SAF, terry took that choice away by getting a silly red card and leaving them a man down
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-20 18:49:50	@rajeshnair112 and u keep saying he didn't do it to see his team lose, he jeopardised that by lashing out at a player.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-21 20:52:14	@dannyh9623 why would they pay 38 when his buy out clause is 33?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-21 20:54:20	@FootyAgentITK has someone been reading redcafe by any chance?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-22 17:01:03	@corrienationstr that doesn't mean it's genuine. I'm sure something was said about that account a few days ago about it not being real.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-22 22:30:14	Does anyone know when you start seeing the effects of going to the gym? Around abouts?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-26 23:28:11	Come on Froch!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-26 23:38:32	You are the man, Froch!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-26 23:41:10	@AwesomeRoberts by far, absolutely love watching him!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-26 23:57:01	@AwesomeRoberts over where?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-26 23:59:50	@AwesomeRoberts he is well known, he's just a very underrated boxer. People are very ignorant and only pay attention to heavy weight boxers
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-27 00:02:14	@AwesomeRoberts I know I loved watching him as a kid when he dropped his hand haha Deserved to win tonight, absolutely destroyed Bute.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-27 12:35:58	@corrienationstr 40mil euros is about 32-33 mil pound which is his buy out clause
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-27 17:46:21	Makes me cringe seeing girls crying over 'celebrities' #fuckoff
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-29 00:48:01	Can't sleep in this heat!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-29 00:50:50	And I refuse to expose my feet for the fear of weird creatures biting them because #ImAShitBag
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-30 14:38:59	Post Mortem: death by accidental Banana trip!
Never eating a banana in public in Manchester again haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-30 15:09:32	@AwesomeRoberts yes they are dicks, but he's now given the racist people an idea of what to do to wind him up!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-29 00:49:07	I refuse to open a window for the fear of someone getting in through it because #ImAShitBag
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-29 00:52:17	I'm absolutely roasting under this quilt and my iPhone is that hot its radiating through my pillow! I'm fucked all because #ImAShitBag
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-30 14:57:58	@AwesomeRoberts why would anyone throw a banana at him
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-30 15:11:58	@AwesomeRoberts I'd rather see him play football than leave the pitch and go home after being racially abused.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-31 01:24:01	@nikkicalderwood haha it's a pain in the arse being a shitbag, going to die from the heat because #ImAShitBag 

Oh the irony!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-05 22:01:33	Surely Asamoah signing for Juve will make Pogba seriously think about whether he will get game time there?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-02 19:19:10	http://t.co/ODl6ALIQ is the music industry's version of Eddy Murphy!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-02 19:24:08	Jessie J and Vince Kidd just smashed that all over the place!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-02 19:32:35	Ed Sheeran has just stole the show! #TheVoiceUK
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-02 19:40:29	Are they fucking serious? Vince not through! He shat all over every other contestant in the show!!! #TheVoiceUK
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-02 20:00:36	@iamwill should have given Tyler This Woman's work by Maxwell to sing, would have smashed that song!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-03 01:09:39	Eyes Wide Shut is one seriously weird film! Everyone is just naked all the time for no reason, doing strange rituals whilst masked!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-03 19:04:40	'I wipe my own ass' haha love #BigDaddy
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-08 16:38:00	Should have fucking buried that! #Polskaaa
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 12:07:39	@corrienationstr united have offices in London, don't write it off just yet.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 12:08:38	@1andOnlyWalshy don't united have offices in London?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 13:05:53	@AntHolland1988 he only said apparently hes going chelsea, can't see anyone really knowing apart from hazard and the club he's joining.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 14:08:53	@AntHolland1988 he stupid if he signs for Chelsea, even city have more stability than them!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 14:20:55	@RichardDelile you've changed your tune thought he was signing for united?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 14:26:00	@RichardDelile well I will apologise if he does but all points to Chelsea to be fair. Looks like money rules his mind.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 14:26:43	@dannyh9623 yes on his twitter account, definitely not the way united conduct things.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 14:27:25	@1andOnlyWalshy he's doing it on his twitter account apparently. Definitely not a united way of conducting things.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 14:28:02	@dannyh9623 so would I but looks like his head has been turned by money.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 14:29:32	@dannyh9623 will make himself look a tool if he does go Chelsea free announcing he was definitely going Manchester haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 14:31:06	@1andOnlyWalshy I've got to say I've never ever seen a player announce where's he's going on twitter or before the club for that matter.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 14:32:29	@dannyh9623 French tv channel said 5pm and sky confirmed it would be 4pm our time, don't know of they're just speculating or defo know he is
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 14:35:20	On a lighter note, Barry's been ruled out of the Euros. Booooyaa!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 14:36:14	@paulbienkowski @1andonlywalshy that is funny, it's been confirmed he's in liege training with Belgium!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 14:43:32	@dannyh9623 think they're guessing wisely 'cause they can throw money at him, they'll then claim they knew 'cause they have a 'source' haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 14:46:40	@dannyh9623 still think we have a chance but I'd put my money on Chelsea, he seems to be blinded by their flukey CL win.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 14:50:19	@dannyh9623 mustn't have watched the CL final coz Chelsea didn't deserve to win one bit!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 16:29:45	@1andOnlyWalshy sky said he spoke to the club he's joining and they said he's allowed to announce it after his training session.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-08 19:20:33	@dannymaconline Gets even more beautiful every time I watch Hollyoaks!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-28 19:55:13	@source_football clutching at straws a bit aren't you, just accept you were wrong.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-29 00:49:52	I refuse to expose my neck for the fear of being stabbed in it while I'm asleep because #ImAShitbag
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-09 13:37:29	I would rather be stabbed in the eyeballs with a pin than go to #Parklife
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-09 14:13:33	@israhISK Hey Israh, I know you do a lot of promoting just wondering whether you know anyone that would fancy the Plush night at sankeys?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-01 14:38:24	Sky Sports have said the only 2 players released by united are Kuszczak and Owen, thought we were releasing Pogba?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-30 14:28:15	@Benno_LUHG it's the way they word it I think, I always look at it as 97 shirt plus the £1 I kept is 98 and the other 2 went to the parents.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-30 14:56:47	@AwesomeRoberts I do know that, I'm talking about the fact he did an open interview saying if someone threw a banana at him he'd kill them
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-08 20:25:23	What a goal by Pavlyuchenko!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-08 20:51:17	@NapzMusic I watched it last night, really good film :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-08 21:05:57	@NapzMusic I know me too but completely forgot about it until recently.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-08 21:56:31	Come on you bastards! #BBUK hahahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-11 15:15:21	EA Servers on PS3 are shit! Paid £30 for FIFA to be disconnected every 2 minutes!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-09 14:11:52	Anyone fancy the plush night at sankeys on 10th August let me know and I'll get you tickets. Roger Sanchez &amp; More!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-05-31 17:01:15	@MUFCSupport kagawa, strootman, James Rodriguez. Powell aswell for the future.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-01 01:06:28	Is it just me or is it near enough impossible to score with Danny Welbeck on #FIFA
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-03 14:17:46	There is definitely something about Novak Djokovic that makes him sexy.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-03 14:22:27	It's probably because I am strangely more attracted to dark hair, olive skin and stubble. None of this blonde haired, blue eyes shit!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-03 14:26:36	Djokovic is naturally very good looking and doesn't spend more time in the mirror than a woman. He probably wakes up looking that good!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-07 18:45:01	Sick of this PS3! anyone know why I am losing connection to opponent on FIFA 12 pro ranked matches, every single game without fail?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-09 14:31:57	@israhISK it's mainly house I think with DJ's like Roger Sanchez &amp; more. It's on 10th August. It's all sorts of music aswell in the bar.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-11 17:16:29	Are these officials being fucking serious?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-15 18:55:10	Haha that kid was proper eyeballing Ibrahimovic then!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-13 19:50:37	Feel sorry for the young Dutch left back, will be a quality player in a few years but he's really struggling out there tonight.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-17 19:41:16	@Benno_LUHG don't forget your baguette.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-18 14:54:25	@corrienationstr odds don't mean anything, all just depends on the amount of money people are betting on a certain team and rumours.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-18 16:15:58	@corrienationstr seriously these odds mean nothing! If everyone put 100 on modric going wigan his odds would be slashed making Wigan faves!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-18 16:16:43	@corrienationstr prime example is betting being suspended on sneijder and we all know how that turned out.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-18 20:21:20	Criteria for positioning in this group table is ridiculous, surely Spains goal difference should mean more than Italy scoring in every game?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-18 16:50:43	@corrienationstr yeah but everyone knew he was coming here and he admitted he wanted to come here, odds are rumour based and high (1/2)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-18 16:50:57	@corrienationstr amounts of money being put on.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-18 19:11:17	@FootballFirstUK @awesomeroberts don't think he will go to a team people are expecting, his dad pretty much ruled out any major clubs.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-20 13:06:39	@corrienationstr both completely different players, modric is a CM and sneijder plays the Rooney role. We got kagawa for that, we need a CM
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-20 20:06:47	“@Benno_LUHG: Part 1: how many pound coins in a dozen!?” 12?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-20 20:06:55	“@Benno_LUHG: Part 2: how many 50p's in a dozen!? #fastanswers” 12?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-20 21:52:22	@shartnett91 30th June one? I might know someone who has 2.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-20 21:54:14	@shartnett91 no worries, hope you enjoy the shitty stone roses haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-20 22:01:43	@shartnett91 i like a couple of their songs, the rest i'd rather stick pins in my eyes then listen to haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-20 22:57:11	@MUFC_83 absolutely incredible! heard he locked himself in a dark room a few times for hours to try and get his mind set right. Dedication!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-20 23:25:55	We think we have hard lives? Watch Ukraines Forgotten Children and see if you can still complain about your life.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-26 23:05:27	@Pat_Cunningham don't think he can take any sort of constructive criticism, I mean who can't spell 'or' it's a 2 letter word!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-26 23:35:18	@Pat_Cunningham don't forget that do is though! I still follow him just so I can keep picking holes in his 'exclusives' haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-27 18:56:06	Pepe may well be a diving, cheating cunt but what a beast he is at the back
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-27 20:21:16	Portugal would do even better in these tournaments if they had a decent striker, Almeida is shocking.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-21 23:47:00	@corrienationstr I wouldn't believe Marca they said hazard had joined united!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-01 16:38:21	@corrienationstr because he plays the same position as kagawa! We need a CM
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-01 16:47:03	@Benno_LUHG Moutinho, costs less, slightly younger and can tackle aswell as create which is what we need. Modric isn't great defensively.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-01 20:47:37	Santi Cazorla's kid is absolutely beautiful!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-01 22:47:58	Lucky Number Slevin, top film!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-24 23:00:32	@Benno_LUHG bet he thinks by making an anonymous account he will get away with it, what he doesnt realise is IP addresses can be traced haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-03 13:53:40	@corrienationstr Wikipedia can be edited by anyone, it's a public domain. I could have wrote that about moutinho for all you know.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-03 19:34:21	@FootballFirstUK not a chance why would we sign a LB to then sell the only other one we have. Fryers will prob leave and Fabio's on loan.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-25 23:22:01	@Benno_LUHG haha this looks like the remains of a potato when you've used a spud gun.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-25 23:24:56	@Benno_LUHG looks like Max Branning and Vinnie Jones have taken up a new profession, these pictures of yours are hilarious!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-25 23:28:12	@corrienationstr nowhere in the Bild article does it say they have signed him just that they want him.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-25 23:43:05	@Benno_LUHG @corrienationstr because you always catch him out?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-25 23:44:02	@Benno_LUHG your knee one really does look like a potato after you've stuck a spud gun in it a few times haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-25 23:50:58	@Benno_LUHG thing is all his stories will be questioned especially when his only source is media outlets.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-25 23:53:54	@Benno_LUHG exactly anyone can be made to look itk, when in reality no one knows anything apart from the parties involved in the deal.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-25 23:56:23	@Benno_LUHG think the most infuriating thing reading his exclusives is the low level of spelling and grammar skills #Shocking
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-26 00:01:26	@Benno_LUHG if he wants people to take him seriously he needs to except when hes wrong and stop putting ;;' before every 'exclusive'
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-26 00:07:05	@Benno_LUHG or 'we're hearing stories will get stronger this week' we know that coz as soon as united show interest, journalists run with it
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-26 00:14:27	@Benno_LUHG me neither I just think for someone who claims to know things behind the scenes, he carries himself very unprofessionally.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-26 15:22:37	Why does it sound like David Attenborough is commentating the Nadal/Bellucci match.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-26 18:37:44	@TheTransferMan he's 27
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-26 20:31:58	@corrienationstr just because his buy out clause is 40mil doesn't mean we have to pay that, hulks is 80mil but porto will accept 38.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-29 16:58:07	@corrienationstr Marca also said we'd signed hazard.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-06-29 21:35:03	@JoeyTmufc don't understand it, he's one of the best defensive LB's around, if we wanted an attacking LB we'd just stick with Evra
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-04 23:06:14	@Benno_LUHG I would have had either at Utd but would say Lucas has more potential than hazard and is a lot more grounded and humbler.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-04 23:08:04	@dannyh9623 he can actually play CM aswell as long as he has someone playing a bit deeper behind him, can also play on the wing.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-04 23:09:21	I fucking hate Moths! There is no escaping them.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-06 15:49:24	Is it just me that finds something strangely attractive about Tsonga?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-06 16:32:40	@dannyh9623 doubt we'll get 4mil for fryers it'll just be compensation set by a tribunal, 1mil max I'd say
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-06 16:38:29	@dannyh9623 no need to apologise, 4mil is the rumour flying round but with his contract up it'll just be a compensation fee.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-06 20:09:11	@FootballFirstUK remember though, united are very secretive in transfers and they would've known his price would rocket after Euro's
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-06 20:16:27	@FootballFirstUK very true, I think Modric was SAF's main target but he knows as well as us that he's not worth the price tag being quoted.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-06 20:20:27	@FootballFirstUK I'd rather pay 30-35mil quoted for modric on someone like Javi Martinez
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-06 20:23:24	@FootballFirstUK I just don't think he's what we need, we have creativity in abundance we need someone who an get stuck in.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-07 23:01:39	@dannyh9623 ESPN are about as reliable as a chocolate fire guard. Reported hazard to united was a done deal after someone made a fake site.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-07 23:07:14	@dannyh9623 haha we all remember http://t.co/w6bZHWlc! Hope it is true, would be a much better fit than Modric.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-08 14:36:08	Murray has got to be one of the most unlikable sportsmen I've come across, miserable sod. #wimbledon
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-08 21:33:13	@FootballFirstUK I would slit my wrists with a rusty spoon, he's not a CM and will never fulfil that role aswell as a natural CM
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-08 21:34:11	@FootballFirstUK don't think he's worth the risk, 2 reconstructed knees on top of the fact he's only ever played in the Brazilian league.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-09 14:14:47	@MUFC_83 only when she's with Lee Mack.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-10 22:04:37	Deana needs to get a pair of balls, I would not be letting anyone speak to me the way Shievonne spoke to her #BBUK
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-14 22:22:31	@paulbienkowski @56_united it's not his natural position though, he looks like he really struggles when he plays deeper.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-14 22:35:50	@paulbienkowski yeah hopefully Clev will get off to a good start, Ando is good when fit i just think he struggled adapting to CM aswell.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-15 20:26:21	@Benno_LUHG probably in the 3 of 4231, he's not a proper winger he cuts in a lot and drives through the middle. Also drops deep like Rooney.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-16 14:16:30	@Benno_LUHG I should think so too, schools mark you down if you reference Wiki haha drives me mad that people don't know it's public domain!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-21 21:47:17	@Clare_29 did you not know they have a hard time convincing players to join top clubs, that pay generous wages and win lots of trophies? Ha!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-21 22:50:30	Don't understand all this slagging off SAF stuff, I absolutely love that man and respect him more every time I read a new interview with him
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-21 22:51:56	We all have bosses we don't like but SAF has a job to do and that is to win trophies with united, the glazers give him money to buy players&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-21 22:52:59	It is his choice who he buys, his philosophy has always been youth and no matter how much money he has he will always stick by that&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-21 22:54:13	He will never pay over the odds for a player he doesn't see worthy of the price. He is the most experienced and successful manager&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-21 22:56:30	Out there, he knows what he's doing! He may secretly believe that the glazers are affecting the club but he will never say it because&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-21 22:57:55	He respects the owners, why would he put his position at the club in jeopardy by slagging the glazers off publicly?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-21 22:58:58	Last and most importantly he loves this club, infact he lives, eats and breathes this club what more can you ask from one man?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-21 22:59:54	@AwesomeRoberts not once did he call the fans. He said real fans will understand that the glazers aren't affecting the way the club is run.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-21 23:02:47	@AwesomeRoberts they don't affect what SAF does transfer wise, they give him what he needs. We spent £50mil last summer, that isn't bad.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-21 23:06:30	@AwesomeRoberts before city had money and prior to glazers take over, we never spent excessively, we spend wisely.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-21 23:08:43	@paulbienkowski all this backlash is just a bunch of angry fans waiting for a 30-40 mil CM signing, fickle fickle fans!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-21 23:10:53	@AwesomeRoberts you're forgetting SAF will not spend over the odds for a player that does not see fit for the fee. Never has, never will.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-21 23:33:36	@paulbienkowski they forget that SAF chooses who we buy, aswell as DDG he spent £30mil on 2 players we didn't necessarily need instead of CM
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-11 07:18:00	@Benno_LUHG he's there for the Labour Party Sports dinner
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-10 14:47:47	@corrienationstr seriously you believe this? Anyone can change Wikipedia! Just take a look at Lucas Mouras.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-10 14:54:49	@corrienationstr just be careful with what you post because people will give you abuse for things like that.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-17 20:28:10	@corrienationstr No it was made up!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-12 13:34:04	@MUFC_83 I just hope however we play, kagawa doesn't end up playing CM in a 442.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-12 19:34:25	I am sick, I am sick, sick, sick o' your shit and when I'm not sick, I am tired. I am sick and tired. Hahaha #Monster-In-Law
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-13 20:08:36	@Benno_LUHG vodka redbull or southern comfort and lemonade!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-12 23:28:02	@Benno_LUHG it was the way he worded it, he said it slows down the transfer industry. Think he meant just a big tournament in general.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-14 22:19:43	@56_united Eriksen plays the same role as Kagawa
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-14 22:26:14	@paulbienkowski I think over time he would probably adapt to it better whilst under SAF but I wouldn't buy him as a solution to CM
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-14 22:30:19	@paulbienkowski yeah I agree completely, if we can keep our players fit I don't think we need a CM it's just the doubt about Ando, Clevz etc
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-17 23:44:16	@dannyh9623 it was a photoshopped picture of him saying 'Manchester' to prove a point that people believe anything haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-18 14:41:13	#GoalsIWillAlwaysRemember Ronaldo's header v AS Roma. Nearly knocked himself out!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-15 17:51:39	@Benno_LUHG he can't even play CM that well his natural position is the role kagawa plays, he becomes a passenger when he's not on the ball.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-16 13:26:20	@Benno_LUHG hate it when people say "yeah but he's signed, I saw it on wikipedia" conversation stops right there for me!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-18 14:43:52	#GoalsIWillAlwaysRemember Scholes' rocket against Barca, the look on his face when it went in was priceless!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-17 14:06:24	@paulbienkowski I wouldn't believe this guy too much, he said Gill was going brazil yesterday to wrap up the Moura deal
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-17 20:12:48	@corrienationstr it's not true someone made it up to see if people believed it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-18 20:09:21	Got to say, we've got some talented players coming through at united at the minute #MUFC
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-18 23:00:01	@dannyh9623 the look on his face when he realised it had gone in was priceless haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-18 23:50:42	@Benno_LUHG Exactly, did the same thing with Phil Jones. Think he knows if he has a good Olympics the likes of Real, CFC will come knocking.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-25 08:03:48	@FootballFirstUK because its more likely than you think.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-20 20:42:46	Jack Butland looks a very good young prospect. He's definitely one for the future.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-20 22:47:50	If anyone ruins Batman for me, I will hurt you.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-20 23:15:28	@JoeyTmufc please give us a heads up if you're gonna put a spoiler on here so I can avert my eyes haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-20 23:24:27	@JoeyTmufc haha thanks, take it you didn't think much of it?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-20 23:28:33	@ollyofficial definitely not the only one! RVP has only scored 141goals in his whole career has only been prolific for 1 season!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-20 23:31:30	@JoeyTmufc I think it would be a very hard job trying to better The Dark Knight anyway, some brilliant individual performances in that film.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-25 13:22:04	Please hurry up and take Macheda off!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-25 15:42:58	The women's GB team look better than the men's one haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-25 16:08:35	I was coached by a few of the England women's football team when I was 11, including Kelly Smith. Got to say she was someone I looked up to.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-25 23:44:57	@dannyh9623 I do this too! I start convincing myself something is gonna get my feet or someone is gonna stab me in the neck haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-25 23:46:26	@dannyh9623 Tunnicliffe and Petrucci played really well today, I was impressed! Petrucci spraying balls about like Scholesy.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-25 23:53:22	@dannyh9623 Yeah both have so much composure on the ball. I never thought Bebe was too bad to start with, showed his capabilities today tho!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-26 00:08:45	@dannyh9623 Kagawa will be immense for us! Think he will play the number 10 role so much better than Rooney, plays defense splitting passes
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-26 14:57:56	@corrienationstr they're just old quotes.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-26 22:19:21	@dannyh9623 I'd love it if O'Hara did him for slander, Leon Knight has got no job and no money to pay the fine if he got found guilty .
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-26 22:38:57	@dannyh9623 yeah a lot of muppets thought he was hilarious, I don't really know of him either, the only Knight that's comes to mind is Zat
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-26 23:35:33	@MUFC_83 He was a bit of a tool really, she's a brass for apparently sleeping with them for money but it's ok that these men handed it over?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-27 09:26:56	@dannyh9623 yeah I suppose but don't think RVP would wanna be a bit part player although that partnership would be phenomenal!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-26 21:52:36	@dannyh9623 bit of a nobody in the football world, exposed Jamie O'hara's wife as a slag telling everyone who she's slept with.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-26 22:24:50	@dannyh9623 yeah think it's something like 15 clubs but is now unemployed, how is a footballer unemployed with all them clubs out there?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-26 22:30:07	@MUFC_83 Disgusting! They have kids and when they get older they will always teased that their mum was a slag and slept with most of THFC.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-26 22:33:00	@dannyh9623 apparently caused a bit of controversy about Obama supporting gay marriage aswell, seems like a bit of a div wanting attention.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-27 00:26:07	@R_o_M @pjlmblog sorry to butt in, but I've got to say the JT and Lloyd situations are very different, don't you think?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-27 07:04:48	@R_o_M @pjlmblog no I meant when you was talking about him sleeping with his mates wife earlier.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-27 07:10:37	@Pat_Cunningham congratulations Patrick, hope everything goes well for you both :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-27 08:25:26	@dannyh9623 I'd rather not get him tbh, rather have Welbeck playing regularly.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-27 08:30:33	@dannyh9623 I know but the only way to do it would be Rooney behind him and that means kagawa out of position!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-27 09:06:19	@dannyh9623 I just can't ever see SAF completely abandoning wingers, with the diamond you'd have to have 2 proper midfielders at least.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-27 11:38:01	@pjlmblog @r_o_m I agree with you, can't believe the stick she's getting. The footballers she's slept with ate just as bad as her!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-28 18:31:37	@FootballFirstUK what do you mean by deadline, we can sign players from brazil til our window shuts?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-29 14:42:00	@BusbyMUFC is the football on the red button or anything? Or is everyone having to watch it on streams?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-29 14:56:34	@corrienationstr is the match on tv or are people watching it on Internet streams?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-29 14:58:30	@corrienationstr I can't seem to get it! Only giving me options of tennis and gymnastics.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-07 20:15:18	@MiguelDelaney any club with a decent amount of money will always affect united deals, thanks for the information anyway :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-07 20:27:48	@MiguelDelaney Tbh I wouldn't pay the fee's even if I had the money, its ridiculous what exactly do they do apart from cause trouble?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-29 15:06:07	@JoeyTmufc is the brazil game on the red button? People are saying yes but I can't find it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-07-29 23:15:51	@Benno_LUHG most commonly associated with stress or lots of exercising, my arm twitched for weeks during my GCSE's a couple of years ago!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-08 19:59:14	@michael__oram fuck off
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-04 20:04:45	Ennis you beaut! Absolute Class
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-07 18:42:27	@MiguelDelaney he seems like a right pillock, calling Manchester depressing on his twitter account. Is the deal looking unlikely now?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-11 04:35:54	Home sweet home :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-11 14:55:30	@michael__oram this was your face after realising you'd danced with a tranny haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-04 18:46:51	What have I missed in regards to united? In turkey and none of my phones work!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-04 20:08:29	@J_Ennis amazing! Congratulations.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-07 17:53:11	@MiguelDelaney is that Wagner Ribeiro twitter account real? If it is he seems very unprofessional
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-12 11:52:49	Rodwell to City? Could be a decent player for them if he stays fit but its a big risk to take. I'd much rather take that risk with Barkley.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-13 16:21:37	@source_football do you know if there's any truth in Sahin to United? A few people saying done deal for 12mil
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-13 00:10:44	@Benno_LUHG I think it could be Nuri Sahin, seems unsettled at Madrid and is linked with every team bar United which is normally a good sign
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-13 22:53:06	MCFC have signed Le Havre youth player Jules Ntcham, supposedly one of the world's brightest footballing prospects.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-15 19:42:44	@michael__oram Song is on his way out aswell, not looking good at all for arsenal!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-15 20:05:04	@michael__oram she is gutted now! let's all #PrayForArsenal haha I actually didn't want him to start with because I think it was him or CM.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-15 21:57:58	Don't care, Billy Madison is one of the best films Adam Sandler has done!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-15 22:32:02	@56_united what do you make of the Eriksen to united almost done deal rumour?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-15 23:51:38	@BusbyMUFC a lot of different things being said, Bwin announcement, selling OT naming rights and the other is Erkisen to united.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-14 14:49:49	@56_united isn't Isco another attacking mid though?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-14 14:54:54	@56_united oh I see, just that I've watched him a few times and he seems to play quite high up the pitch, much rather sign Sahin.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-14 15:02:20	@56_united yeah I suppose with him being so young he can be moulded by SAF, do you know if there's any truth in the Sahin to Utd rumours?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-17 12:37:52	@JoeyTmufc the sun dream team
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-17 12:54:17	@JoeyTmufc cheers :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-15 16:19:19	Real Madrid paying 23.5mil plus add ons for Modric, what happened to the quoted 40mil we were told we had to pay? #JustBecauseIt'sUnited
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-17 22:54:45	@michael__oram he did today in his press conference with SAF
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-17 22:57:23	@michael__oram I watched the whole press conference today he thanked 'Mr.Wenger' all the staff at arsenal and all the fans aswell :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-17 23:04:01	@michael__oram http://t.co/bZ2ZiaBo its the first thing he says, might make you feel better haha I can't wait I'm lost without BPL and MOTD!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-17 23:05:57	@michael__oram being a united fan is the best bit we win silverware almost every year unlike a few teams ;) x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-17 23:12:13	@michael__oram You's will eventually if Wenger stops selling every fucker in your team haha I actually dont mind Arsenal its Chelsea I hate!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-17 23:26:56	@michael__oram city were offering him 280k a week! He gets 180k basic at united. Arsenal have a 90k a week wage cap don't they?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-17 23:31:49	@michael__oram true, no player is bigger than any club. Don't think arsenal will have to worry about scoring goals anyway x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-17 23:37:56	@michael__oram think you's could maybe get FA or 'capital one' cup haha most guys find it quite intimidating that I like football lol
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-15 17:26:09	@BusbyMUFC I'd sign Martinez now while his price tag is still sort of reasonable. He would improve us so much.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-15 19:36:18	@michael__oram I really hope arsenal win nothing next year, oh wait... ;)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-15 19:57:28	@michael__oram cazorla will prove to be a good signing for you's. No way, already? Jayde has the holiday blues haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-15 22:31:04	@dannyh9623 I think the announcement will be Welbeck or Nani contract but think we could be in for a surprise signing too!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-15 22:34:10	@dannyh9623 Yeah I expect it to be a contract extension, Berba's sale is a good shout too. Definitely think SAF has a trick up his sleeve!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-15 22:42:06	@Pat_Cunningham @dannyh9623 Nurse knows fuck all tbf haha some German pundit who said RVP to united was done is saying Eriksen is done too.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-15 22:44:48	@dannyh9623 just think he could sign someone that hasn't been linked with us that much, something out of the blue.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-15 22:51:12	@Pat_Cunningham what do you mean everyone's ITK aren't they? ;) David Johnson said there's another one but he wont say until RVP is official
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-15 22:51:51	@Benno_LUHG let's all hope we don't sign one then haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-23 20:37:31	Bit of El Classico while nothing else is on.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-20 18:23:31	Oh how I love that football is back on my TV screen again!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-16 15:53:30	@56_united he's not arrived yet, that's just him in the airport before travelling to Manchester from london
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-16 20:10:57	@Benno_LUHG he hasn't arrived yet, SSN said first part of medical was probably at Carrington and the scans will be done at bridge water tmrw
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-16 23:37:29	@56_united they're going one better this time, they're waiting for him to sign the contract so they can forge his signature!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-20 21:16:35	Lucky that we have DDG, that could have been a 4/5-0 scoreline. Everton away is a tough game, at least it's out of the way now!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-20 21:34:14	@michael__oram everton play with pretty much one man on the pitch everything goes to Fellaini because of how big he is, Ful and Swa played&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-20 21:38:59	@michael__oram guarantee you any money if Fellaini didn't play tonight it would have been 0-0, every ball is played to him.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-21 15:04:42	@michael__oram age shouldnt matter though, Ox is better than Theo even though Theo has what 3years of experience on him.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-21 15:14:11	@michael__oram he threw fabregas in at a young age, same with Wilshere. Ox is young and fearless, theo runs down blind alleys all the time
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-17 12:50:07	@JoeyTmufc what's the name of that one? I couldn't find any of the other fantasy football apps on mine.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-21 15:34:42	@michael__oram why, are you sick of being proved wrong about football by a girl haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-21 15:42:47	@michael__oram fabregas joined as a 16 year old and made his debut that year becoming arsenals youngest ever out field player.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-21 15:46:45	@michael__oram he did the year after though at 17 years old when Viera got injured.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-21 15:57:43	@michael__oram I definitely don't haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-21 15:58:50	@Clare_29 Buttner can play LB CB and midfield so we can always put him at CB if we need to.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-26 23:38:53	Adam and Paul, BBC2, Now. One of the funniest films you'll ever see!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 00:39:13	Gotta say this film appeared to be much funnier the first time round of watching it.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 00:59:36	Wow wow wow why do I not remember this ending? Not so funny to be fair.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-24 09:45:14	@Benno_LUHG you could park a car inbetween them fuckers haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-18 21:39:34	Is it just me or is Agger the spit of Munch from Two Pints of Lager?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-19 17:47:20	So many mixed opinions on this Büttner, few people saying he's no more than championship material and others saying he's a quality young LB!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-19 18:41:21	Why are people saying Aguero is out for 6 months? He has to wait two days for his scan to see what the full extent of the damage is!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 16:19:01	@hannaI10 @niazamdk didn't see this mention, I'm sure it's hilarious though that someone said gay people should be killed.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 20:12:55	@AbdisThoughts @niazamdk don't be so idiotic, over 1500 species of animals display homosexual behaviours including male dogs.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 20:24:11	@AbdisThoughts course there's evidence, research has been done on these sorts of things since the 90's.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 20:25:07	@niazamdk what because I have wider range of knowledge than you? grow up little boy and start acting your age.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 21:07:36	@AbdisThoughts just goes to show how stupid you are, if it was unnatural humans wouldn't be born with the genes which makes them gay.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 21:30:22	@AbdisThoughts scientifically proven you idiot, doesn't god also ask that you respect and love your neighbours without discrimination?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 21:32:03	@niazamdk no having knowledge that everyone is different and deserve to be treated with respect is what will get me a well paid job.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 21:32:58	@JoeyTmufc you mean things like 'eccentric hair cuts, but great kickers of the ball' is not good commentary? Haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 21:50:27	@AbdisThoughts people interpret holy books differently nowhere in the bible is being gay listed as a sin.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 22:16:19	@AbdisThoughts Yes and nowhere is homosexuality listed as a sin of sodom, it's proved to be genetic and we are made in the image of god.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 22:17:45	@niazamdk I have a nice set of qualifications thanks for the concern, you would go further in life if you treated people with equal rights.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 22:19:13	@niazamdk @abdisthoughts don't make me laugh you fucking idiots, obviously not been brought up correctly by the looks of both of you.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 22:30:46	@niazamdk I could reply to that but I'm a bit more mature than you. Enjoy being overly defensive about being gay, only suggests one thing.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 22:30:57	@AbdisThoughts @niazamdk *thing
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 22:38:51	@niazamdk @abdisthoughts It's the 21st century, you clearly think it's alright to be prejudice. Excellent parenting skills from your parents
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 22:39:20	@AbdisThoughts Start of a sentence starts with a capital *Don't
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 22:48:38	@niazamdk @abdisthoughts Mate the way you're going, you aren't getting anywhere near that place. Your mum ain't either.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 22:49:32	“@AbdisThoughts: @BeeLee_93 don't try that with me. Your mum knows how literate I am”&lt; where's your full stop then?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 22:50:06	@niazamdk so if it's not right, why are gay people allowed to marry?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 22:59:27	@AbdisThoughts And don't start trying with that grammar.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 23:16:07	@MUFC_83 Bruce Willis is a ghost in Sixth Sense and it's all a dream in Inception.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 23:26:01	Apparently I have atrocious views on life because I think it's ok to be gay, how dare I not be prejudice and narrow minded.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-27 23:27:22	@niazamdk I see you don't have an answer to my marriage question. Seems like you've done enough imagining for the both of us.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-19 21:25:40	That Jasmine's body is disgusting! #CBB
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-24 23:19:56	Just watched The Bachelor, @SpencerGeorgeM is my ideal man. Looks wise and personality wise!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-25 00:56:55	Annie Mac going in hard tonight!! #houseparty
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-20 21:20:59	@michael__oram aw we were fucking dyer weren't we! Hopefully it's just down to rustiness and the fact we had a makeshift defence.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-20 21:27:50	@michael__oram pre season games are nothing compared to PL. The only reason they're saying its a crisis is cos you're selling everyone.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-20 21:35:13	@michael__oram pretty poor bottom league teams. QPR and Norwich will be relegated this season.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-20 21:37:03	@Lee__Woody @michael__oram Lee tell Matt Lucas to get off his high horse because Arsenal are victims haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-20 21:40:59	@michael__oram @lee__woody I'm not upset im always first to admit when Utd are poor, you started with the arsenal victim shit ;)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-20 21:44:33	@michael__oram oh yeah forgot you were an extra in your own film haha! Think you will beat us at your ground but not at OT
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-20 21:46:05	@Lee__Woody @michael__oram I never fucking see Jayde haha yeah don't forget for famous person 'Gary Russell' #PCKing #Corrie
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-25 20:25:04	“@niazamdk: Gay people don't deserve a celebration, yous are morally wrong.. Yous need to change or be gassed, where's Hitler” what an idiot
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-21 13:18:02	Daniele De Rossi rejecting City and staying at Roma? Result!!!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-21 14:44:42	@michael__oram he's better than Barry and De Jong, he would no doubt have been played as a sweeper in 3-5-2, Carrick is underrated and was&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-21 14:46:01	@michael__oram only second to YaYa on pass success rate last season. He's a creative mid but has to play holding CM now due to lack of mids.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-21 14:49:01	@michael__oram They've been chasing De Rossi for 3-4 years but hes Roma through and through, I do actually like Ox when he plays central :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-21 14:58:45	@michael__oram I think so, Mancini has been after him for donkeys! Ox is miles better than Theo but always seems to play 2nd fiddle to him!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-25 22:34:07	@niazamdk read it again if you have to.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-25 23:08:06	@niazamdk do one you fuckin bellend
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-22 15:29:24	@AwesomeRoberts @corrienationstr that's not true Pachuca have admitted we have approached them about Herrera
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-22 15:30:05	@56_united tubeplus is the best I've ever used.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-22 16:29:30	@AwesomeRoberts I'm not saying we will I'm simply proving you wrong that we have approached him.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-22 16:34:42	@AwesomeRoberts what do you think they do when they approach a player? They have to talk to him or the club.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-22 16:36:22	@dannyh9623 box to box midfielder
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-22 16:39:55	@AwesomeRoberts the club have said we have approached the player, how would they know that if we hadnt spoken to someone. Thats enough proof
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-22 16:45:02	@AwesomeRoberts so I suppose actual quotes from Pachuca's sporting director doesn't count then as proof #epicfail
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-22 16:48:48	@AwesomeRoberts running out of things to say? There are quotes we have spoken to them about him along with Liverpool #youdontknoweverything
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-26 12:12:25	@niazamdk sounds like you like a bit of bum love, your original tweet was a bit too defensive, was it to hide the fact your gay? Nobhead.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-26 14:47:03	@niazamdk how original, did you think of that all by yourself? Do yourself a favour and re-evaluate your life you narrow minded prick.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-26 15:03:38	@niazamdk seriously fuck off you've got absolutely no argument about you whatsoever.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-26 15:58:27	@niazamdk well don't be such a dick then and be so narrow minded as to discriminate against people you don't deem normal.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-22 17:06:58	@AwesomeRoberts yeah because sky are always right! Hazard, Sneijder? Stick to Moto GP and F1 cos you clearly know fuck all about football.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-22 17:11:37	@AwesomeRoberts 'the world doesn't revolve around man shitited' do one mate, obviously a plastic fan. Realised? So for a second you&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-22 17:12:40	@AwesomeRoberts questioned it, seriously fuck off I don't know you, fortunately, because you come across as a complete prick.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-22 17:13:59	@AwesomeRoberts according to you quotes in the IBTimes don't count as proof, #armchairsupporter
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-22 17:16:59	@AwesomeRoberts and please explain to me where I said twitter is 110% right and fool proof.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-22 17:18:51	@AwesomeRoberts has got to be the biggest nob head I've ever come across on Twitter! Supposedly a united fan but calls them man shitited?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-26 18:47:20	@MUFC_83 I guess nows not the time to tell you that the song has already gone into the charts?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-26 18:57:17	@MUFC_83 that's the British public for you, the last one was where's my phone. Although it was a funny song, it never needed to be in charts
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-23 21:46:14	What a response that was by Barcelona!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 12:07:05	@niazamdk are you actually retarded or are you just pretending? They wouldn't be allowed to legally marry each other if it was wrong.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 12:21:44	@niazamdk just a quick question, do you only have these views on men being gay or women too?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 14:13:09	@niazamdk yet again you avoid my question because you have absolutely no valid points, you've got nothing about you whatsoever.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 15:23:25	@amerrsalah @niazamdk @abdisthoughts do gay girls get it in the arse too or is it natural for girls to be gay?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 15:23:58	@niazamdk @amerrsalah @abdisthoughts aw are you having to get all your mates involved because you can't fight your own battles? Pussy
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 15:38:54	@amerrsalah @niazamdk @abdisthoughts are you speaking from experience? You sound like you've found your dad gettin it up the arse.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 15:40:09	@AbdisThoughts @amerrsalah @niazamdk my point exactly, you don't mind gels doing it because you like it but you hate gay men. Contradiction.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 15:41:03	@niazamdk @amerrsalah @abdisthoughts seriously how old are you I've heard better insults off kids. What next? You gonna tell me my mums fat?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 15:41:47	@AbdisThoughts @amerrsalah @niazamdk haven't got any brothers you idiot. You's all seem too defensive to not be hiding something.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 15:49:04	@AbdisThoughts @amerrsalah @niazamdk mate you look like you've been in an accident.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 15:51:01	@amerrsalah @abdisthoughts @niazamdk you seem to know a lot about disowning gay people, the subject is very close to home for you isn't it?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 15:53:12	@amerrsalah @abdisthoughts @niazamdk so your assuming which one i am now in my picture? you wouldn't think my dad was Asian would you?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 15:54:23	@amerrsalah @abdisthoughts @niazamdk they aren't jokes they're questions hence the question marks
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 16:00:40	@amerrsalah @abdisthoughts @niazamdk you assumed I was the pale one and now you can see whether the other girls fat from just her face?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 16:02:13	@niazamdk seriously you actually care about how many followers you have on twitter? do they make you feel wanted?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 16:02:55	@niazamdk @amerrsalah @abdisthoughts oh so now you 'know' I'm fat? Fucking magic you lot aren't you.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 16:07:42	@niazamdk how would you know where I am in life, you don't know me. I'm exactly where I need and want to be.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 16:09:46	@niazamdk @amerrsalah @abdisthoughts no it's an assumption a lot like the ones you's keep making.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 17:52:55	@niazamdk @amerrsalah @abdisthoughts really you've started with the playground mum jokes, grow up you pathetic little person.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 18:49:11	@niazamdk @amerrsalah @abdisthoughts seriously fuck off I've got nothing more to say to you. Immature, low life with no morals whatsoever.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 20:47:35	@niazamdk @amerrsalah @abdisthoughts fuck off you prick, I'm not the one that has to hide my face on my picture.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 20:48:50	@AbdisThoughts @niazamdk @amerrsalah fuck off Abdi I'm not talking to you, grow up and stop acting like a kid.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 21:09:57	In all 18 years of my life I have never seen Rain Man. Worth a watch?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 21:16:36	@MUFC_83 drove me mad that she got away with it, got to say though Sheridan Smith played her role well too.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 21:24:34	@amerrsalah @abdisthoughts @niazamdk what because I can actually spell?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 21:29:32	@TayaSophie bloody hell, anything else? haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 21:39:56	@niazamdk FUCK OFF, what part of that don't you understand?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 21:47:12	@niazamdk seriously why are you carrying on with this conversation? Do one.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 22:29:04	Who else remembers when a packet of Transformers crisps included the vehicle body, wheels AND balls?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 22:38:44	@niazamdk really are you just gonna keep going? Get gone.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 23:31:32	@niazamdk go away you sad low life
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-28 23:32:02	@amerrsalah @abdisthoughts @niazamdk fuck off you inbred cretin
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-29 20:50:45	Ronaldo you absolute beauty!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-29 21:13:22	@JoeyTmufc I went a few years back and it was shit, don't know what it's like now though.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-29 21:20:00	@JoeyTmufc yeah, we were just shown round the machines, but you weren't allowed to touch or eat it. It might have changed now though.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-29 21:27:45	@JoeyTmufc I'd say go for the majority vote, I mean what do I know haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-30 10:58:43	Premier league trophy being transported from one side of City's stadium to the other in a tatty old wooden box #massiveclub
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-30 11:24:35	My little sister with the premier league trophy and charity shield, it's a shame about the club she plays for. http://t.co/hf2x068d
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-30 11:33:59	Proper fans these city supporters, one of the coaches has just said to me 'These trophies will probably be back at Old Trafford next year.'
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-30 13:46:32	@BusbyMUFC I was at the stadium today and they had a new player doing a fitness test there but couldn't make out his face.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-30 20:06:06	@dannyh9623 Sturridge apparently
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-29 15:12:40	Absolutely love thunder and lightning! If the hail stones didn't hurt so much I'd probably stand out in it ☔⚡
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-31 11:00:07	@corrienationstr Ronaldo hates city, he will never go there. Fact
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-31 11:02:46	@corrienationstr when Real were knocked out of CL last season, he said the only thing that will cheer him up is if Utd beat City n win prem
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-31 13:41:14	City fans buzzing over Maicon signing, he will be tore a new one by nearly every winger in the Prem, even Walcott!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-31 14:43:57	City fan trying to tell me Carrick is shit, not a top flight player and definitely not a United player. I sent him this http://t.co/u2WgQHmc
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-31 16:31:11	@BusbyMUFC a lot people saying its cabaye
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-31 17:03:13	@MUFC_83 aren't you supposed to be the biggest cunt on twitter? You'll ruin your reputation with stuff like this haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-31 17:34:18	@MUFC_83 just do it now and have it for dinner, 2 birds one stone and all that shit.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-31 18:00:23	@dannyh9623 if they are only loaning him though they still have another week don't they to finalise it?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-31 18:48:04	@rajeshnair112 we play Sunday
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-31 19:05:37	Falcao's taking the piss here!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-31 19:16:49	@Benno_LUHG Messi to Norwich done deal
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-31 20:24:34	@michael__oram doubt it, its not the official sky account. According to everyones sources most clubs have had a bid accepted for Cabaye haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-31 20:26:26	@michael__oram ITK's saying we have had a bid accepted and his medical is soon! yeah right SAF is tucked up in bed with a cup of cocoa!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-31 20:30:13	@michael__oram Arsenal will be fine just need to get Wilshere back and you'll be laughing. Yeah Hopefully we'll get a few decent players in
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-08-31 20:32:53	@michael__oram I think Liverpool will be tired, they didn't look great against hearts yesterday.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-01 22:29:53	What a save by Al-Habsi that was!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 12:15:21	@michael__oram hope you's win today hate the fuckin' bindippers haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 12:19:44	@michael__oram Santi cazorla with an assist :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 12:21:40	@michael__oram he's class, once he settles in properly and the other plays get an understanding of him he'll be your best player.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 13:18:20	@michael__oram think we'll find it harder than we expect at Southampton.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 13:21:30	@michael__oram yeah Southampton look up for it, after all that I missed arsenals goal. Who got the assist?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 13:23:41	@michael__oram lucky prediction from me haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 13:30:33	@michael__oram next prediction is diaby man of the match haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 13:32:12	@michael__oram he's been brilliant in that first half, Song who? Haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 13:57:22	My dads standing in the kitchen eating toasties while I'm watching football because he knows I hate the noise of people eating haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 14:05:52	@MUFC_83 I've not heard that rumour but I wouldn't be surprised if he did, lack of strikers will give him plenty of game time
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 14:07:36	Diaby is MOTM for me but his performance will more than likely be overshadowed by Santi Cazorla's assist and goal.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 14:25:50	@MUFC_83 think it's just because Lindegaard has more of a commanding presence in the box atm and Saints have quite a few big players
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 14:28:23	@michael__oram Diaby MOTM and Cazorla assist. 2/2 ain't bad haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 14:29:13	@56_united probably a 4231 with Welbeck drifting in from the left.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 14:32:12	@michael__oram kagawa assist, v.Persie to score atleast one. Kagawa or Valencia MOTM. Watch me get them all wrong now haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 17:00:44	In complete shock at what just happened! Now's the time to sing 'he scores when he wants' #MUFC
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 18:15:29	Don't understand this onslaught of Clevz, he was one of the only players that was actually trying to move the ball forward.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 21:04:50	@56_united @busbymufc here's the story-http://t.co/5jCSCetH
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 21:15:43	@BusbyMUFC "I didn't celebrate my goals because I'm unhappy with some people," said Ronaldo. "They're in the club and know who they are."
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 21:24:38	@GHTT_ @busbymufc I'm only copying and pasting what's online
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 21:26:07	@Ryan_Stocker_5 I'd love it if that happened haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 21:30:58	@GHTT_ @busbymufc the quotes are on sportsmole aswell, I know they're not that reliable either but surely they can't write fake quotes?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 21:41:33	@GHTT_ @busbymufc sky sports news app is reporting he said he's unhappy with certain people inside the club.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 22:03:30	@GHTT_ yeah I understand, have you heard what they're saying on Spanish radio stations?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 22:34:35	@dannyh9623 he hates them.Told reporters the only thing to cheer him up after being knocked out of CL was if utd beat city to the Prem title
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 22:39:04	@BusbyMUFC his contract is up in 2014 isn't it? Cut price at the of this season, plus if you believe what you read we get first refusal.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 00:08:24	Tonight's Accused... Wow, just fuckin' wow
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-09 20:17:03	One of the best bands I've ever been fortunate enough to experience live is Coldplay!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-09 21:04:28	Although Rihanna's songs are very commercial and she is well loved by many, she is one of the least talented singers I've ever heard!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-09 21:42:15	Love Jay Z but what did he just do to a perfectly good track?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-09 21:46:43	The Scientist is one of their best songs along with Green Eyes #Coldplay #ParalympicsClosingCeremony
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 23:12:25	For those questioning Ronaldo's loyalty to United:- Ronaldo would never go Barcelona because he respects and loves Real Madrid...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 23:14:13	He loves and respects Manchester United and SAF like a second father figure, why would he ever go to City? They're our rivals!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-02 23:34:21	@michael__oram would never happen in a million years, he gets about £300,000 a week at real and they only pay 10% tax.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-10 12:34:01	@michael__oram after all that talk of The Game, it was on ITV4 last night haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-03 07:35:25	@michael__oram he would still say no, they offered him a 400,000 a week contract last summer and he turned them down.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-03 07:42:19	@michael__oram yeah that should do it haha he won't leave Madrid for a few years yet it's just a ploy for a better contract.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-03 08:23:54	@michael__oram me too, international football is so boring to watch!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-10 13:00:24	@michael__oram yeah that's why I didn't let you know last night, thought you'd prob be asleep haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-10 13:14:13	@michael__oram thats the joys of only being in college 3 days a week haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 16:08:47	Paralympic Tennis: You've got to question the fairness in which one of the USA guys has a motorised wheelchair. Considerable advantage there
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 21:23:23	Leon Knight had a fuckin' mare tonight, humiliating girls to make him feel better about his sad life. Backfired big time #SmallManSyndrome
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 21:39:41	@michael__oram a pic of him for what haba
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 21:42:23	@michael__oram I don't mean it like that haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 21:50:55	@michael__oram me too haha what did you think I meant when I said small man syndrome?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 21:57:45	@michael__oram haha no small man syndrome is when they are small in height and feel a need to make up for their height inadequacy :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 22:00:41	@michael__oram haha he's a div, was released by god knows how many football clubs and now just sits at his desk being a keyboard warrior
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 22:06:38	@michael__oram haha I've been called a keyboard warrior before, they just havent met me that's all, I can get you to vouch for my bullying;)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 22:10:39	@michael__oram yeah I am a big softy really :) I just like it when people can take and give a bit of banter haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-03 21:45:22	Unless someone can prove these Florentino Perez quotes are legit then as far as I'm considered it's all twitter bollocks.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-10 21:13:24	@MUFC_83 what channel was this on, will catch up on it as soon as I can.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-12 20:52:30	@michael__oram that's one film I never really liked of his. Have you seen seven pounds?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-12 21:08:39	@michael__oram I just thought it was a little underwhelming for a film that he's in. Watch seven pounds, one of the best films he's done!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-12 21:19:24	@michael__oram cant explain fully 'cause it will give it away, he basically tries to help 7 people 'cause he feel guilty about something.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-12 21:23:38	@michael__oram silly me haha think its just if a film is supposed to be sad and it doesnt make me cry I just feel a little disappointed haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-12 21:29:03	@michael__oram the only bit I found sad was the scene where he sleeps in the toilet, seven pounds will make you cry like a little bitch haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-12 21:34:31	@michael__oram it wasn't so much disappointing from Will 'cause he's a brilliant actor, it was more that I didn't enjoy the directing of it.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 22:13:35	@michael__oram haha you were lucky you didn't get all three of us starting on you, the little one is just like a mini me lol
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 22:16:37	@michael__oram haha that's because everytime we saw you on holiday you were pissed and being very loud about a rose or something ;) lol
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 22:18:37	@michael__oram cheeky sod haha yeah me too, night :) x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-12 21:38:34	@michael__oram yeah gave that a watch the night you suggested it, loved the ending reminded me of scary movie haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-06 16:24:42	@mixraceking starts at 7 on MTV
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-06 16:35:04	@mixraceking oh no just checked apparently it's only aired today in America but its on MTV at 9 tomorrow
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-06 18:03:54	@xxdann it on E4 all this week due to Paralympics
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-04 17:16:25	@BusbyMUFC same as Evra aswell
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-13 09:42:41	@michael__oram The game has a brilliant ending, I was just like WTF haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-11 20:05:12	I'm sick to death of reading people playing the victim when it comes to 9/11. It has nothing to do with your race or religion and if...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-11 20:06:19	...you get blamed, it's to do with some delusional extremists that flew a plane into two buildings, killing thousands of people...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-11 20:07:13	Or have people forgot that part? Show some respect for the dead and stop looking for ways to feel victimised.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-11 20:44:32	Don't care, Danny Welbeck has been the liveliest player on that pitch since coming on.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-04 21:45:59	@MUFC_83 missed tonight's Accused, gonna BBC iPlayer it. Was it that good?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-04 21:47:53	@MUFC_83 yeah absolutely love the programme, last weeks was brilliant.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-04 21:58:39	@MUFC_83 ah ace I'll give it a watch later, did you watch A Mother's Son?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-14 17:15:32	@Lee__Woody @michael__oram it's brilliant! Watch The Game aswell when you have rinsing you haven't already seen it
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 20:48:37	@michael__oram he's just being a dick exposing girls out of spite because they probably turned him down haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 20:51:50	@michael__oram just every girl he possibly can, set up an email and got all his followers to send him pics so he can humiliate them.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-05 20:53:24	@michael__oram definitely not I'm a good girl :) hope you're not one either ;) haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-08 01:26:07	Just finished watching The Prestige, what a fuckin' film that is! The best I've seen in ages.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-15 13:05:50	@michael__oram is Giroud gonna do a Bergkamp and Henry and score his first goal against Southampton? Haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-15 13:17:04	@michael__oram think a lot of players are being rested from top few teams, rumours that RvP and kagawa are being rested.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-08 19:41:54	@michael__oram Took your advice on that film, unbelievable it was!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-08 19:50:58	@michael__oram gonna get my dad to watch he will love it, the end was mind blowing! Have you seen The Game with Michael Douglas?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-08 20:04:22	@michael__oram The Game's a brilliant film watch it if you haven't already, I've not seen that might watch it to tonight,
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-08 20:10:26	@michael__oram did you watch contraband when that came out? That was a pretty good film
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-08 20:15:52	@michael__oram yeah it was a good film, love Tom Hardy he was brilliant in Warrior
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-08 20:28:07	@michael__oram lucky sod, all I can see when I look at him though is Bronson haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-08 20:31:20	@michael__oram I seen something about that on Jonathon Ross, did well to get where he is
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-08 20:32:59	@michael__oram with your little district porno haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-08 20:35:13	@michael__oram sorted then aren't you because you are a bit camp haha ;)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-08 20:37:37	@michael__oram I made up for that though by recommending The Game haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-08 20:44:20	@michael__oram watch it and let me know what you think, when I watched it I was blown away. Fucks with your head.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-08 21:09:15	@michael__oram will do, you do the same with the game and we'll hate thoughts haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-17 19:04:02	What's the betting someone assumes SAF is at this match to watch Fellaini and/or Cabaye, after what's been said in the media recently?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-17 19:17:23	Brilliant play for that goal by Everton
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-17 21:10:27	Aw fuck missed the beginning of An Officer and a Gentleman!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-17 22:31:09	@corrienationstr he was only there to watch Newcastle as we play them next week in capital one cup
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-18 15:55:41	@GlenGraham2 how much are you looking for, for the tickets?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-18 20:56:18	@BusbyMUFC he looks like he's trying to pull off a discount Prince look. Absolutely awful hair do
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-18 21:01:28	Fucking love @Cristiano, everyone knows he's a #MUFC fan at heart! #vivaronaldo
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-18 16:34:37	@GlenGraham2 sorry just checked with my mate, he doesn't think he an afford it atm but if come across anyone that does I'll let you know
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-19 15:37:27	@OfficialTMCD1 I actually thing Juve will win.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-19 15:56:19	@OfficialTMCD1 Exactly, Chelsea don't actually look that good against the better teams. It seems some of the players need to settle in.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-19 17:32:27	@OfficialTMCD1 as long as united put it in the bag I don't mind who else wins :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-26 21:03:24	@MufcIsNo20In12 yeah I like Ando and Clevz but they can't win the ball like he does and he never stops.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-26 21:07:02	Knew we'd get Chelsea!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-26 22:27:21	Have never and will never take a drug in my life #DrugsLive #C4+1
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-26 23:01:11	A lot of Idealising MDMA tonight on C4 seem to be talking more about euphoria than the negative effects of it.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-24 15:26:50	@MUFC_83 a teacher in my school did this, left his wife after the honeymoon for a school girl, got her pregnant and then left her!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-24 21:11:37	What the fucks going on, on Queen Kenny's twitter?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-27 15:28:09	@bensmith130 Suarez got 8
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-27 15:36:47	@Benno_LUHG think it was 40k, don't understand how they can both receive different bans for the same thing!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-30 22:54:22	Wait, what? Golf was on? Must have missed that when I tried to avoid it at all costs.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-30 22:58:55	@KiranH0405 haha fucking hate it, it's not even a proper sport!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-27 16:21:10	@bensmith130 I know don't understand how they can give out different punishments for the same thing!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-27 16:33:06	@bensmith130 plus it's John Terry so should just automatically get a bigger ban for being a complete nob head haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-27 17:36:55	@Benno_LUHG did you buy the ultimate edition? Or just the normal one?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-27 17:39:03	@Benno_LUHG oh ok just wanted to know if it's worth buying, suppose EA will make an add on soon to buy it online
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-27 18:50:10	@MUFC_83 did you buy the ultimate edition? Didn't know if it was worth while so gave it a miss. Heard its just 24 FUT packs.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-27 18:53:17	@MUFC_83 yeah me neither only ever play clubs or career mode
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-27 18:57:54	@MUFC_83 when you play in a team with your pro, love building the player up from scratch
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-27 19:02:16	@MUFC_83 its only ever good if u manage to get decent people to join your club, yeah I go online, didnt much on 12 though hated the tackling
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-27 19:13:46	@MUFC_83 yeah that would be good, did you ever do h2h seasons? My uncle said that was the best feature on 12. I'm more of a COD person tbh!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-21 23:13:59	Whys my twitter going on some mad mission and favouriting loads of tweets I've never even seen from people I don't even know?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-01 15:11:41	Hate playing people who have laggy connections, fucking bastards! #FIFA
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-01 15:23:06	4-0 up before half time and the twat leaves!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-27 23:10:25	Slightly awkward situation. It's gone midnight, it's pitch black and I've got to wait in a queue of about 60 hoodrats for #FIFA
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-27 23:24:31	@MUFC_83 fuck off rubbing it in, I'm stood behind a woman of about 55 who's stoned out of her face!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-27 23:52:40	As if some guy behind me just said "why's shawshank still £5 it isn't even that good." Fuck off!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-27 23:57:18	@MUFC_83 haha you little stud! I had 3 guys pestering me, even thought I couldn't hear them talking about me when I was on the phone!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-28 00:14:03	@MUFC_83 yeah I was the only girl apart from the stoned oap haha I'm on Xbox, u?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-28 00:44:17	Absolutely shattered can't even keep my eyes open to play Fifa!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-28 00:46:39	@MUFC_83 I should have got some pro plus while I was out!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 12:07:38	@corrienationstr Galatasaray's vice president has said we have held talks over defender Semih Kaya
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 12:10:05	@corrienationstr apparently metro are reporting it
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 16:04:15	@gu11u What tier is the tickets in?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 16:09:09	@gu11u have you sold them already or try still available?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 16:23:21	@gu11u no problem
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 16:37:36	@OfficialTMCD1 think it was just general complacency by all players, thought they had it in the bag with the 8 point lead and let it slip
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 16:48:43	@OfficialTMCD1 IMO it was anyway, look at the Everton, Wigan and City games. Poor display from majority of the players, looked disinterested
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 16:49:42	@OfficialTMCD1 obviously everton game was brilliant attacking play but you can't play 'you score one, we'll score 2' mostly backfires.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 16:52:23	@OfficialTMCD1 Ferdinand has enough experience to be doing tht himself, if I remember rightly Evra was the reason we conceded a goal tht day
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 17:44:19	@BusbyMUFC @glen_johnson don't know how he's got the audacity to even say he cheated you can see the blatant clip of his heel!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 18:00:07	@Danny_Cent @busbymufc exactly, you could see from johnson's reaction that he knew it was a penalty. Didn't contest the decision once
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 19:04:45	@DarrellFlood well fergie did say everything's a conspiracy in regards to utd haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-28 21:02:02	Someone want to fill me in on this Nani story?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-28 21:06:46	@MUFC_83 bloody hell! Hasn't seemed to want to be here for a while, looks like he's forcing his way out. Who's leaked the story?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-28 21:10:27	@MUFC_83 think he would have been sold in the summer if we had a decent offer. Would rather him gone if his hearts not in it anymore.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-28 21:25:05	@MUFC_83 that was the only reason that I was hoping we landed Moura, Nani is probably the most frustrating player I've seen in a utd shirt.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 21:19:24	Have any of the city fans started spouting shit yet about how they don't care about this cup and they didn't have their strongest team out?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 23:01:46	@MUFC_83 I've never once tweeted during a game, any normal fan would be too interested in the match to even look at their phone/comp
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 23:13:03	@MUFC_83 I got some foreign students once who stood up on the steps during the match and took photos of themselves, nearly lamped them!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-25 23:22:05	@united69 @mufc_83 exactly far too many are quick to right us off before the games even finished. Don't talk to me until the final whistle.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-26 11:14:55	@Pat_Cunningham paddy power have it at 21/10
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-26 11:26:08	@Pat_Cunningham yeah I thought the odds would be better for him but that's the best I've seen.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-26 18:21:08	@BusbyMUFC I'm thinking 4312 with rooney playing behind Welbeck and chicharito
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-26 18:40:20	@MufcIsNo20In12 theres no natural wongers on that pitch so would you rather us put fletcher on the right, don't think so.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-26 19:34:22	@MufcIsNo20In12 when fully fit fletcher is brilliant just needs match fitness
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-03 18:33:13	Goin for a Dortmund win tonight, goin into the game with confidence. They're downfall will be counter attacks from their high pressing game
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-03 20:43:37	@OfficialTMCD1 think it'd be just the same, playing Thursday and then weekend leaves less time to rest
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-03 21:11:43	@MUFC_83 I said right from the beginning that the teams I would bet on getting through the groups were Real and BVB, city outclassed again!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-23 21:52:29	@MUFC_83 if people didn't realise that from the minute he started trending those red Mohawks then there is something seriously wrong!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-04 20:36:56	Is it the refs fault they are getting beat again? #comedyclub
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-29 13:30:53	Why the fuck does Wenger insist on playing Gervinho? He's fucking shocking, never seen a player lose possession or be caught offside so much
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-29 13:35:12	The last time I saw someone be caught offside so many times in one game was when City kept fielding that Caicedo!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-09-29 21:56:41	Been waiting for my Chinese for 2 hours, 2 fuckin hours! They replied with 'we can give you a free drink'. Fuck off, stick it up your arse!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-06 21:32:06	@michael__oram http://t.co/Si93okeT haha watch this, I found it pretty funny!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-06 21:45:56	@michael__oram Cazorla is brilliant, just what Arsenal needed. Always said he would be your best player when he's settled in.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-06 21:49:29	@michael__oram I just mean gettig an understanding with the other players. I know hoping we pull it off, as long as we don't start giggs!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-10 15:42:11	@MUFC_83 absolutely loved handbags and gladrags, but always remember thinking as a kid that it made no sense whatsoever haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-10 16:35:35	@MUFC_83 haha that's classic that! Never really been a fan of Rod either.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-07 09:55:18	Praying we don't start Evra or Giggs today! Both of them down the left is a disaster, defensively.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-07 11:46:56	Does anyone know if Tony V is back for MUFC today?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-07 17:09:47	Great team performance today. Rooney &amp; Clevz were brilliant, Evra too, although people forgetting he didnt warrant the start today.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-11 21:20:56	@MUFC_83 did you hear that clip from a while back where they actually asked him if he had molested kids? Was uncomfortable to listen to.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-11 21:26:14	@MUFC_83 sounds a bit stereotypical but he looked like the sort that would molest kids. He was told to take it to his grave with him haha!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-07 18:25:33	#ElClasico over X-Factor all day!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-07 20:17:21	Watching X Factor on plus one, definite nose job for Leona Lewis there!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-07 20:18:31	And has no one else noticed the resemblance in the beginning of her new song to Christina Aguilera's Hurt?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-07 22:34:27	Bale and Suarez were an embarrassment today with them ridiculous dives #MOTD2
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-07 23:06:25	@corrienationstr he didn't get booked for the elbow.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-05 21:58:56	So many good films to choose from tonight, American Gangster, Changing Lanes and Assault on Precinct 13! #spoiltforchoice
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-12 11:00:25	@sharliin09 Your account is sending spam DM's haha just thought u should know.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-14 20:26:31	What did I just see on Facebook? A black baby with blue eyes and the caption is 'only racists won't like this picture' #ohdear #desperation
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-14 22:05:31	Sly looks rough as, in Rocky Balboa!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-14 22:10:14	Notorious is on film4, love this film! #PartyAndBullshit
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-14 22:27:44	@Benno_LUHG one of the best biopic films I've ever seen!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-14 23:58:16	@paulbienkowski I asked him about his constant moaning, he said he gets money for charity for followers, then blocked and unfollowed me haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-15 00:06:02	A fact that not everyone knows. The boy that plays Biggie as a kid in Notorious, is in fact his and Faith Evans son! #BIG
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-15 14:38:50	@MUFC_83 Seen your retweet of Fury, please tell me you dont like him? Price is the only scouse Ive ever wanted to see win something haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-15 15:05:38	@MUFC_83 did u see him the other night on channel 5 during DeGales fight? What a tool he is, gonna get a pounding of Price.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-08 21:42:54	@MUFC_83 @joetaylor84 have to disagree with you RG in this one, MOTD shown it and he definitely looked at RVP before he kicks the ball.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-08 22:04:17	@MUFC_83 @joetaylor84 he also says it to scholes when he's celebrating. He says something along the lines of 'no way did I mean that'
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-08 22:12:02	@MUFC_83 he says 'RG stop being a stubborn twat, I didn't mean it' haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-13 19:07:22	@Benno_LUHG all the girls are either models or actresses/extras, it was brig talked about on the radio.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-15 21:41:45	Tyson Fury is actually the biggest idiot on twitter, gonna look a complete twat when Price does him in.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-15 23:05:28	@Benno_LUHG foot asylum ones are better just very expensive!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-15 23:18:05	If anyone on here hasn't seen the 'Our War' episodes, watch the 1st one on BBC1 now. If you don't shed a tear, you have no heart!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-15 23:18:33	@Benno_LUHG no problem :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-15 23:26:27	@Benno_LUHG I was recommended them by a teacher as I'm doing public services, makes you respect them so much more when you see what they do.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-13 19:36:35	How awkward did Jahmene look everytime they mentioned getting the ladies? #XFactor
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-13 21:11:45	Can't fucking stand my dad sometimes!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-16 07:48:24	Absolutely shattered! Wish I was wrapped up in bed and not at college!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-16 18:03:57	@BusbyMUFC he said this back in June I think, it was right after they won the premier league.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-16 18:58:33	Adrian Chiles, shut up you bellend!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-16 19:17:36	Anyone got a link to this Eng v Serb U21 thing?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-17 07:34:42	One lesson this morning, then a football match for the college team and then home. Pretty decent!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-08 22:27:58	@MUFC_83 he sure did, he also said he wants his butt plug back but I'm not sure what he's talking about haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-08 22:37:58	All weekend I couldn't keep my eyes open, now that I have to get up early in the morning for college I'm bloody wide awake!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-18 20:50:04	@BusbyMUFC try and get as many players as possible from same league, nationality or team. I've got a Bundesliga team which is working well.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-18 22:30:42	A grown man getting shit loads of Miley Cyrus tattoo's on his body, that's not weird at all! #oddball
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-09 13:36:48	“@MUFC_83: “@MENnewsdesk: BREAKING: Shameless will end after the current 11th series”
About 6 series too late” and the rest!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-09 13:42:27	@MUFC_83 tell me about it, can't stand the programme plus I know someone in it and it makes me cringe everytime I see it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-17 18:03:29	@Benno_LUHG my money's on Kane!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-17 20:56:32	Anyone wanting to go to Cream's 20th anniversary at Sankeys on November 16th let me know, can maybe sort out Early Bird tickets. #Sankeys
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-17 21:00:01	Line Up for that night is... Thomas Gold headlining the main room, Andy Mac, George Kafetzis and Tim Owen. #Sankeys
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-19 11:24:31	@Daddy_Wonder How much for both? Is it possible to change the over 65 to an adult ticket?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-19 15:57:22	@VijayKara1 You still got them tickets?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-19 16:08:03	@chris_willo Have you got 2 seated together?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-19 17:00:33	Hate the fact my dad won't go to United matches. £24 for exec suite seats, offered to buy his, still the answer was NO!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-19 17:40:38	@VijayKara1 was it £25 for the both of them? Are u in Manchester for collection?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-19 17:44:04	@VijayKara1 will definitely have them if that's the case
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-19 22:56:49	Gotta be up and out at the crack of dawn tomorrow! #notgood
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-19 23:07:17	So hard to sleep when your head is banging!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-22 14:03:00	MEN journalists are wankers always writing half the story!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-22 21:40:58	Vicks nasal spray and cups of tea are the only things I need in my life right now #ill
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-22 22:40:11	Get rich or die tryin' would come on when I have to go bed! #alwaystheway
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-23 20:59:32	At the moment when we're playing weaker opponents Im always confident we'll win even if we concede 1st as our offense counters our defence..
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-23 21:00:48	or lack of defence should I say. Won't be so confident though when we're playing better teams and we struggle to break through their defence
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-23 21:03:16	Just seems to me that we go out and underestimate the oppositions ability to score and create chances, need to sort that out quickly.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-23 21:24:35	Lindegaard being injured could be a blessing in disguise, De Gea is a confidence player and will only get better with a run of games.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-25 18:16:59	Only just noticed that Tottenham have a different shirt sponsor in cup games to the one they have in the EPL!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-24 17:25:27	@Benno_LUHG I nearly put them in my accumulator! Luckily enough they kicked off before I did mine!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-25 22:10:19	Fracture was a pretty decent film to be fair.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-24 18:44:22	@michael__oram I put a free £10 bet on arsenal 2-0, podolski first goal. Hopefully a 350 return tonight haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-24 20:29:13	@michael__oram haha imagine me being an arsenal fan! Was gonna put it on the city game but knew it would be unpredictable
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-25 23:18:51	My back is killing from playing 'Borstal Hockey' today and then being made to do press ups straight after. My fitness teacher is brutal!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-24 20:44:31	@michael__oram I know, unlucky but gutted they made me lose out on 350 dollars! Love that City lost #championsleagueyou'rehavingalaugh!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-24 21:00:35	And that's why City will never win CL whilst under Mancini, his tactic is 'run and score' #amateurmanager
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-24 21:11:43	@michael__oram you's will be fine, every teams suffers from lack of form or blips. Yous will beat QPR at weekend and get the confidence back
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-26 15:16:23	Always really tempted to go out and buy the new Medal of Honor to see if it gets any better, it doesn't. Think I'll give it a miss.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-26 18:32:54	@AnthonySheehy1 I've just bought MoH, hope it's better than last years I found online multiplayer really difficult!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-26 18:38:53	@AnthonySheehy1 battlefield3 was impossible online! There was something about MW3 I didn't like, can't wait for black ops II looks immense.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-26 18:43:56	@AnthonySheehy1 I always think the maps are better black ops. I'm on Xbox.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-27 23:22:14	@dannyh9623 if its on your phone then your clock should automatically go back an hour at 2am so just set it as normal
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 10:35:47	This might shut people up about DDG going back to Spain! http://t.co/LNeWFfYL
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 13:47:34	What the funk has Josè Enrique done to his hair?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 14:19:41	Brilliant first half to this game!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 15:16:41	@JoeTaylor84 young and Valencia
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 15:18:01	@OfficialTMCD1 and it's all down to that 80 year old fan who doesn't like it haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 18:40:31	@BusbyMUFC he's supposed to be a utd fan aswell haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-20 16:36:07	@MUFC_83 refusing to wear a top that supports anti racism because his brother was racially abused definitely spells attention seeking to me
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-20 16:40:57	Rio refusing to wear a top that supports his belief of anti-racism is completely illogical and is definitely him making today about himself.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-20 16:43:03	People forget he is paid my Manchester United to represent them in the best way possible, going against SAF isn't acceptable.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-20 16:47:38	@Ryan_Stocker_5 don't understand the people defending him, made a complete prick of himself yet again.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-20 17:30:39	@MUFC_83 my 'white' cousin was stabbed by a group of Asians who were caught on CCTV racially abusing him yet no one would defend him in...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-20 17:31:33	@MUFC_83 court because they said it was unlikely they would be convicted as they are the 'minority' race in the situation.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-20 17:34:24	@MUFC_83 it's a fucking joke, if it doesn't exist why we're signs put in pub windows years ago saying 'no Irish, no blacks, no dogs'
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-20 20:24:09	Bit of Fallowfield tonight with the sister :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 20:02:38	C4 News are discussing potentially the biggest hurricane to hit the USA in less than 2 days and guess what they're more bothered about?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 20:03:41	...How it's going to affect the Election race! And there was me thinking people's safety and livelihoods were more important!!!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 20:05:18	@corrienationstr a goalkeeper can't play you onside!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 20:05:38	@steutd2007 read next tweet haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 20:08:18	@corrienationstr the whole point of the offside rule is that someone needs to be between u and the goalkeeper unless you're behind the ball
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 20:09:05	@steutd2007 don't worry about it :) it's a joke! How is the election race more important?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 20:10:07	@MUFC_83 I thought Cleverley looked a bit off key today aswell
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 20:12:00	@MUFC_83 although our goals came from the wing, I do think packing the midfield and playing the diamond would have been better.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 20:13:53	@steutd2007 after Hurricane Katrina I can't think what the damage will be if this one is potentially bigger
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 20:16:20	@MUFC_83 absolutely love Cleverley! Don't understand the abuse he gets, his movement and passing ability is brilliant
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 21:56:34	@michael__oram love this! How many times have Chelsea had decisions go their way? Nothing is said cause its alright if It goes their way!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 22:00:01	@michael__oram I'm good thank you, how is life treating you?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 22:06:57	@michael__oram sorry to hear that, hope things are looking up for you now :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 22:12:32	@michael__oram haha you little poet! I know, think you're midfield will be hard for us to handle unless we play the diamond.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 15:31:40	Whys everyone panicking over this DDG article, its not got 1 quote to suggest its true. IF he was going back to Madrid it would be Atletico
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 19:18:31	I have a new found love for Labrinth!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 19:19:38	@MUFC_83 how dare you insult Chris Martin!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 19:22:25	@MUFC_83 No absolutely love him haha went to their concert last year, the only other concert that I rate higher was Kings of Leon's
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 19:25:33	@MUFC_83 Kings of Leon are fucking brilliant live! Love snow patrol too haha used to like Keane but they've gone all commercially shit!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 19:27:57	@MUFC_83 yeah but you're old, take that is more your music isn't it haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 19:29:05	Fuck off JLS!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 22:17:02	@michael__oram haha I'd take 1-0's me, can't take the pressure! Wilshere looked good considering the amount of time he's had out x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 22:19:39	@michael__oram love watching him, just hate the fact he's not a utd player haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 22:24:50	@michael__oram haha unless city offer him 1mill a week! Did you hear about city offering RVP 300k and he still said no?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 22:28:09	@michael__oram I love him for turning city down, he'll show his respect to arsenal on Saturday, although I don't think it's wanted haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-28 22:32:14	@michael__oram he did, that was all he talked about but then again it's never enough thanks when someone leaves your club i.e. c.ronaldo
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 19:30:32	@MUFC_83 10 years makes a big difference haha prefer 90's and 60's music to today's music if I'm honest
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 19:32:22	@MUFC_83 like what? Who's your favourite band?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 19:36:30	@MUFC_83 love oasis! Never really paid any attention to Beatles and that. Love johnny cash, going to his story/show in Jan. Buddy Holly?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 19:49:23	@Pat_Cunningham probably a bit of ignorance on my part but they've never really grabbed me. Maybe it's my age.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 19:55:51	@Pat_Cunningham don't get me wrong they have written brilliant songs, just never gone out of my way to listen to them like I'd I with others
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 19:56:20	@TayaSophie don't talk through your arse Taya haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 20:00:08	@TayaSophie haha thanks for the laugh! He's terrible! She sounds better when she's not bouncing off the walls dancing and shit.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 20:03:27	@TayaSophie your promise means nothing on this subject Rylan is cacky poo haha, not a fan of MK1 either just know she has a better voice lol
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 20:28:40	I've heard it all now! My little sisters friend who is 11 smokes and his mum 'saves him half a cig' #scrotes
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 20:29:44	Also asked my 11 year old sister to play a game where they pass a cig round and the last one to take a drag has to eat the butt! #fuming
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 20:31:09	What kind of parent encourages smoking to anyone let alone 11 year old kids that aren't hers?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 22:24:21	@Benno_LUHG I think they're bullshit too, not one thing in that article suggests its true.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-21 22:38:05	Ghost is just starting on channel 4+1, that's my Sunday night sorted!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-29 22:19:37	@MUFC_83 do you have a stream that you usually use on laptops or computers for it?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-03 14:44:15	If Rooney hadn't have missed that penalty, I would have won my bet of United to win 3-1 van Persie first goal scorer at 33/1!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-04 00:17:39	@paulbienkowski the difference is Rooney wouldn't ask for it at half time, neither would any other player in the right mind.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-04 00:25:59	@paulbienkowski doesn't bother me in the slightest just think its odd, it's like he's accepting defeat at HT and more bothered about the top
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-30 20:48:29	Why did I back Arsenal in my accumulator? Fucking barstewards!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-30 21:02:19	@Lee__Woody I was thinking exactly the same, he obviously thinks you can miraculously win the prem over night
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-30 21:05:19	@Lee__Woody me and my dad were just having this discussion, any trophy is better than no trophy
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-30 21:12:20	@Lee__Woody this is when they need a striker that scores when he wants haha #PCking
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-30 21:15:42	@Lee__Woody think you's might actually get falcao if city don't offer absolutely ridiculous money, they offered RVP 300k a week!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-30 21:18:31	@Lee__Woody they'll still go in for him just so no one else can have him, ridiculous club, can't wait for the Arabs to get bored of them.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-30 21:21:42	@Lee__Woody think you's need to sort the defence a bit and maybe another holding mid and you's will be sorted
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-30 21:26:48	@Lee__Woody he's shocking defensively, he'd prob still struggle playing the holding role all he wants to do is attack!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-30 21:31:34	Arshavin is absolutely dire!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-05 22:47:08	@fidan_x I have one in my family, the urge to bite her is unreal haha http://t.co/NCUAv5wO
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-05 22:50:43	@fidan_x you'll have to get in the queue haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-30 22:34:14	@OfficialTMCD1 enjoyment has gone out the window with kids football, my little sister plays for City ladies and is pressured to win every wk
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-30 22:38:26	@OfficialTMCD1 ...and when they don't the coach is really hard on them telling them they had no 'heart'. They're 11!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-30 22:49:30	@OfficialTMCD1 he then thinks its alright to just text the parents apologising! doesn't realise the effect it has on their self esteem
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-04 13:54:01	@paulbienkowski shows his mind set. Ask him at the end of the game when it's over?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-04 16:02:19	@MUFCSparesHOME thought all their fans were in Stockport haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-10-31 01:14:27	Well that film has just ruined my night, so depressing yet so realistic
#BlueValentine
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-01 19:50:11	@MUFC_83 now you have every excuse to do Movember haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-01 21:43:28	@MUFC_83 Haha high self-perception there, its good cause but its like every man becomes a Paedo for a month with them ridiculous tashes haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-01 21:47:54	Is this punch-love drunk any good? Watched 15mins and it's not made me laugh once and its a little weird yet it's genre is rom com!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-01 21:54:31	@MUFC_83 my dad used to have one when he was younger and let's just say he looked like a Mexican 118 man haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-01 23:31:39	This racist fan is supposedly stretching his back with his hands under his armpits, must be a new way of doing it that Im unaware of
#coward
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-06 22:05:17	City fans moaning about this offside goal which WAS offside, not one word was said when Nolan's goal was wrongly ruled offside on Saturday!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-07 09:19:10	Is everyone just positively discriminating about wanting Obama to be president or do you actually know and like his policies?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-02 18:32:28	Tony has lost his eyesight in #Hollyoaks but why is he feeling the need to go cross eyed?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-07 23:20:28	@Benno_LUHG skybets pretty good, that's what I use anyway x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-03 00:39:36	@michael__oram has someone had a drink Michael? Haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-06 16:13:52	@BusbyMUFC he's also pro abortion, which not many Americans knew until an English reporter told them. Their reply? 'well he's not now'.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-03 11:52:48	@michael__oram haha I just assumed with the first sentence not making sense! I'm the best manc in the world so it's hard not to like me haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-03 12:04:48	@michael__oram you're not bad either for a gooner haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-03 12:16:46	@michael__oram I won't I promise haha you cant wind me up either! Should be fun seeing how santos deals with Valencia today haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-03 12:31:54	@michael__oram deal haha santos is definitely your weak link today if he's lazy like he normally is then you's could suffer
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-03 12:43:59	It's so unreal to be playing Arsenal and having V.Persie playing in a United shirt! #OHROBINVANPERSIE
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-08 18:49:02	Hate to say it but Suso is quality, he's gonna be some player!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-06 17:17:01	Kings of Leon are back in Manchester in June, getting my tickets ASAP!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-09 10:25:00	Kings of Leon tickets are booked! ✌
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-09 23:41:27	@BusbyMUFC I used just eat once and ordered a Chinese at 8:30 and it didn't come til 23:10, much easier to just go yourself!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-10 20:50:21	@MUFC_83 I'd have a look at El Shaarawy aswell can play either wing or upfront
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-10 17:23:14	@Clare_29 I think he lost that when he broke his ankle, he took everyone on before that accident now he seems a bit weary
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-14 21:20:22	What a brilliant goal that was by Zlatan!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-14 21:22:00	Another poor decision from 'the best goalkeeper in the world'
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-14 21:32:59	@BusbyMUFC you'll be able to see Joe Hart have another poor game aswell, pressure of being 'the best' is definitely getting to him.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 23:11:04	@Benno_LUHG Tom Ince looks like the only likely transfer.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-12 00:07:59	@NapzMusic lockout or safe house are good films
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-12 00:13:34	@NapzMusic nah I use tubeplus on my ps3 all the time, just put the film in you want and it gives you all the links for it :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-18 17:58:23	@MUFC_83 you can use a hair dryer to soften it and get creases out, just don't put it too close. I'm assuming one of your kids has one haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-18 18:34:30	The Derby is on the same day as my 19th birthday, if anyone fancies getting me 2 tickets then feel free. Thanks. Bye :) #MUFC
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-15 18:28:13	@BusbyMUFC not many people know that the founders took 18% of the 22mil raised last year making them millionaires off the back of charity!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-15 18:44:35	@BusbyMUFC I suppose it's up to them, maybe I'm just being naive but if I founded a charity I would send every penny to the cause.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-15 18:57:51	Well if you weren't depressed before, you will be now! #Hollyoaks
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-12 16:27:01	@fidan_x they have to unless they want her menstrual cycle all over their floor and her fur haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-12 16:29:45	@fidan_x haha it's not pleasant especially on white fur dogs!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-15 19:37:58	That story of Ruby's must have been shit to kill off Johno like that haha #Hollyoaks
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-15 19:38:35	@JoeTaylor84 Johno cause of death: died of boredom listening to some shit story haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-12 22:16:54	@Benno_LUHG ah not too bad then, I've pre ordered mine so just gonna pick it up tomorrow when it's quiet.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-16 00:55:17	@BusbyMUFC as @MUFC_83 would say, she's a bobfoc haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-16 01:04:06	@MUFC_83 @busbymufc Anna Faris
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-16 01:04:35	@BusbyMUFC body of baywatch, face of crime
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-12 23:20:14	Training Day on ITV1 #betterfilm
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 13:43:54	@BusbyMUFC it's for charity, will only cut it when he scores
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 15:29:40	@Lee__Woody @michael__oram he's just an impact player, does absolutely nothing when he plays the full 90
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 15:32:07	@Lee__Woody @michael__oram what he doesn't get paid for is losing the ball and being lazy, west ham game is prime example
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 15:35:16	@michael__oram @lee__woody thats what I mean though, he scores goals but put him out for 90 mins an all he does is lose the ball and is lazy
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 15:42:34	@Lee__Woody @michael__oram I know Hernandez is an impact player, i slate him for being offside.Dzeko only looks good to cos youve got Torres
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 15:46:58	@Lee__Woody @michael__oram yeah i know, that's all I'm saying though, dzeko is a supersub his all round play is weak and is shown in full 90
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 15:53:18	@michael__oram @lee__woody I've already said Hernandez is an impact player, it's you's that are denying that dzeko is the same
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 15:57:42	@Lee__Woody @michael__oram yeah but he isn't a good player he just knows  where the net is which I would expect of someone who is paid 200k
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 16:14:34	@michael__oram @lee__woody he's average
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 16:17:15	@michael__oram @lee__woody for the money they have they could have much better strikers than dzeko and balotelli
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 16:19:35	@michael__oram @lee__woody he did exactly the same last season, scored at beginning of the season and fizzled out by Xmas.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 16:23:02	@Lee__Woody @michael__oram again by being played as a supersub
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 16:27:59	@michael__oram @lee__woody scoring a header from a set piece does not make you a good player, fucking hell Andy Carroll can do that
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 16:31:33	@michael__oram @lee__woody right so Torres' all round play is good but he can't score, do you think he's good enough to be in Chelsea team?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 16:34:14	@michael__oram @lee__woody no I'm asking you do you think him being good at one thing and not an all round player warrants his place at CFC
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 16:37:09	@michael__oram @lee__woody well like dzeko he's good at a certain aspect of his game but he isn't an all round player
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 16:44:20	@michael__oram @lee__woody aguero is in another class to dzeko, 100% better in his movement, passing, ability to hold the ball up, vision.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 16:45:04	@Lee__Woody @michael__oram stick Sturridge up front he'll score u goals
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-19 15:51:47	@MUFC_83 someone posted a pic and it just had a childs head on the floor, achieves absolutely nothing but people feeling bad for 24hours max
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 16:57:35	@michael__oram @lee__woody never worth the 27mil they paid for him, average player in a good team
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 17:02:55	@michael__oram @lee__woody yes and they're average players like Dzeko, put him in a weaker team and he's doing nothing.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 17:05:03	@michael__oram @lee__woody yeah because they went on a spending spree a couple of years ago and bought players for the fun of it
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 17:08:28	@michael__oram @lee__woody anyone would be scoring goals if they had aguero, silva and tevez threading balls to them
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 17:14:35	@michael__oram @lee__woody all I'm saying is watch him the next time he plays 90mins and see how poor he is and we'll leave it at that :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 17:17:44	@michael__oram I've never seen him have a good game, his passing and holdin the ball up is terrible. Doesn't even put a shift in.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 20:00:53	@BusbyMUFC I hope your sarcasm is that good that I just can't tell if you're joking or not haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-16 16:25:07	@Benno_LUHG very good, can play Rooneys role but plays left wing a lot for Malaga. Hes like a right footed Silva with potential to be better
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-19 17:38:56	That gym session has done me right in!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-19 18:19:55	Hate it when people put them gloves on at petrol stations, unless you're retarded at putting petrol in, its not going to touch you! #douches
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-19 19:29:40	@BusbyMUFC just SAF saying he is unbuyable but no one seems to have noticed that he said if CR wanted to leave then he would look to us 1st
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-19 19:48:59	@OfficialTMCD1 I think its more likely for him to leave next summer than its ever been, think him returning to MU would depend a lot on Nike
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-19 19:50:52	@BusbyMUFC he also said 'how do you know we havent inserted a buy back clause' interesting from SAF since he normally rubbishes these things
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-19 19:58:54	Love that the little girl didn't know whether to wave or pump her fist so instead looked like she was calling the camera man a wanker #MNF
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 20:36:00	@its_just_young @busbymufc it's all shit and giggles until someone giggles and shits!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 22:24:49	Hugo is a big southern fairy, fuck off back to Chelsea. #Imaceleb
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 23:01:00	It looks like someone has drew on Michael Owens chin and no one has told him!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 23:07:43	I wish November would hurry up and pass, it's a great cause but I can't stand seeing these pervy pete tashes anymore!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 23:10:31	@MUFC_83 the only chicks that love that shit are chicks with dicks, it's like they've got scouse brows on their lip!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-11 23:59:09	@NapzMusic tubeplus, got everything on there
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-12 21:15:40	Helen Flanagan is a prime example of what make up can do for someone! #Imaceleb
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-16 21:21:39	Sankeys tonight, should be good! #creams20thanniversary
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-13 17:03:05	@corrienationstr his buy out clause is apparently 24million
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-14 00:53:12	Tyrannosaur is a brilliant film, can't believe I've never seen it before!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-12 22:04:10	@Benno_LUHG is the queue long as fuck? FIFA queues are long enough but I would assume CoD gets more people going to the launches.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-20 19:23:57	@MalihaJ_Ali I diagnosed myself with misophonia a while back, I'm terrible cant go cinema or anything because of it haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-20 12:21:34	@OfficialTMCD1 Unlikely but Nike would help with funds if he actually wanted to come back, the money they would make on merch is unreal.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-20 14:10:34	@OfficialTMCD1 just think they would jump at the chance to have him back with Utd, 2 of their most marketable brands together again(CR7&amp;Utd)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-20 17:34:14	@OfficialTMCD1 yeah it's prob wishful thinking on my part but SAF said that if he left RM he would look to us first which is interesting.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-20 17:35:07	@MUFC_83 to actually have a winger with decent delivery would be brilliant!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-20 18:35:14	@MalihaJ_Ali someone who feels my pain! I can't function properly when people eat loudly haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-20 19:29:38	Hope Rafael is subbed at half time, absolutely no need for him to be playing these games. Give him a rest ready for the weekend!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-20 21:49:24	@fidan_x slightly irrelevant though Fidan considering Utd didn't need to win and played a lot of youth team players :) haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-24 23:32:51	@Benno_LUHG I'm optimistic like you, i think he'll be back either in the summer or the one after.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-24 23:36:56	@michael__oram he can fight but can't box, Tyson fury is the same no technique to his fight just a big bastard
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 00:00:01	@michael__oram yeah he is, doesn't half come out with some shit on here. Good :) she's ok, struggling a bit due to one of her mates passing.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 00:05:49	@michael__oram yeah she'll be fine, it was expected as he had a brain tumour but doesn't make it any easier I suppose...Arsenal today?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 00:13:30	@michael__oram this season all top teams are below par, even though we've been clawing wins back we've been shocking!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-23 15:09:58	@MUFC_83 it'll be good to see how well he does without inheriting an already world class team.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-23 15:59:57	@MUFC_83 is he bringing ronaldo with him? That's the question on everyone's lips haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-23 17:26:04	SAF speech after the statue unveiling seemed a bit like a thank you and fair well speech, wouldn't rule out retirement at the end of season.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-26 14:24:08	@Slateloose how much you want for the tickets, are they seated together?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-26 17:38:23	@MUFC_83 it's not! I remember watching the 1st ep where he rubbed the warm paper on his face and thinking wtf? Hate the 1st person camera!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-26 18:16:23	@MUFC_83 Not Going Out, love all the old 2 pints. Big Bang Theory which I know u hate haha. Prefer shows like Would I Lie to You, 8 out 10.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-26 18:21:26	@MUFC_83 haha not really a tv person tbh unless it's some kind of sport, I'd rather watch films.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-26 21:15:00	But then again Newspapers have published it, so it must be true! 😒
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-24 00:17:39	Watching The Blindside in bed, what a brilliant film this is!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-24 14:57:08	@BusbyMUFC download skyfire app and you can use all the normal streams you would use on a laptop.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-27 09:31:41	@Daddy_Wonder how much for two? Need to speak to a friend about it and see if they want to go before I say yes for definite, thanks.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-27 09:36:07	@Daddy_Wonder ok no problem, ill get back to u as soon as I can about them.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-27 10:49:04	@Daddy_Wonder my friends managed to get two in the family stand for £60, thanks for getting in touch with me though.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 12:09:32	@MUFC_83 could very well tip him over the edge this defeat.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 19:20:49	@peterallenparis very different to what he said to CNN, favourite goal was the header v Roma and best moment was the winning CL with Utd
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-27 18:59:19	@Benno_LUHG I thought that but I've heard that scratches show up really badly on the black one.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-27 19:53:36	@Benno_LUHG yes that would probably be most logical haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-27 22:31:48	@JoeTaylor84 don't know how people in general can watch it, never mind just blokes!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 22:53:34	How anyone can watch The Peep Show and enjoy it, is beyond me. For one its not funny and two, the 1st person camera angle pisses me off!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 22:59:44	Yaya's agent said in the summer that he feels hes done all he can with City. That attitude is definitely shining through, doesn't look arsed
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-29 19:03:01	@JoeTaylor84 what the hell is she going on about, exposing RG? Is she really that sad?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-29 19:07:54	@JoeTaylor84 I know god forbid someone knowing our name on a worldwide social networking site! Why the hell did she want his address?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-23 16:01:30	Did anyone else think Ronaldo made no sense today? "I hope to see you soon boss because I need to practice my English and not my Scottish"!!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-29 22:21:59	Can anyone recommend a good iPhone 5 case?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-24 19:07:12	And to think Wenger had a choice between Gervinho and Hazard when he signed the former but thought the latter wasn't ready for the PL #mad
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-24 23:31:15	Hatton has always been a brawler, never a boxer. Never in a millions years should he have come out of retirement. #shitboxer
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-24 23:34:22	@michael__oram just a brawler never had the technique, won't take away the fact he's won titles just never rated him imo
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-24 23:39:27	@michael__oram everyone in the right mind knows Fury can't box for shit though haha Life's good thanks, how's yours?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-26 16:46:21	@MUFC_83 he even does the AVB errrrr hahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-30 14:18:49	@sgpstore does the iPhone 5 linear case have a lip on the front to protect the screen a bit if you drop it? Debating between linear &amp; Hybrid
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-26 16:18:08	What a cock Joey Barton is! Does he think they'll understand better if he does a French accent hahahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-30 15:39:29	My friend asked me to mind her 20 month old baby from Friday til Sunday and only tells me when I pick him up that he has diarrhoea! #Great
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-26 21:12:57	This text was apparently from ronaldo to a journalist saying he would rather go to Paris then sign a new contract with Real...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-26 21:12:17	Seen loads of tweets saying 'no way is ronaldo going PSG' all because of someone at a French radio station apparently seeing a text...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-24 15:03:15	@BusbyMUFC no problem :) bottom left corner should say video if the streams working if not it will say related. Hope that made sense haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-24 18:06:06	Anderson was absolutely brilliant when he came on, deserves more credit than he gets. Evans' our best defender at the minute by far! #MUFC
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-24 20:09:34	Absolutely love chicken and sweetcorn soup but can't help convincing myself that it's someone's snot when I'm eating it #bleurgh
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-27 18:08:43	iPhone 5 in white or black?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-27 23:19:31	Watching Man v Food always makes me so hungry!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-27 19:27:51	@MUFC_83 yeah I know, unless they can prove to me that they know someone in the club then it's all a load of bull.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-24 20:31:56	Actually can't stand Jahmene in Xfactor, his whole façade of being sweet is rather irritating!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 00:21:29	@michael__oram think the thing with arsenal is they always try and walk it in the net, they have no Plan B for when it doesn't work.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 00:24:25	@michael__oram obviously different situations re players but Barca struggle in the same way it's the reason why Chelsea beat them last year.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 00:29:58	@michael__oram yeah they parked a bus but Barca should have been reverting to wingers crossing it, think arsenal need to sell gerv &amp; arsh
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 00:40:04	@michael__oram think arshavin was pushed out unfairly, should be getting on the pitch ahead of Gervinho that's for sure
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 00:49:50	Seeing how heartbroken Hatton was after that fight is quite upsetting, you could see how much he wanted to win for himself and his fans.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 00:51:24	The fear for his loved ones is what this could do to him, could very easily tip him over the edge after this loss.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 00:54:45	Depression is the most isolating illness, people are ignorant and quick to judge what it does to you because it isn't classed as tangible
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 00:58:22	Even though I dislike him, I hope he can overcome this. He's won what he needs to win there's no need to battle with himself anymore.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-25 00:59:16	Last tweet. Suffering with inner demons is what breaks people and unless you have gone through it yourself, you have no idea how hard it is!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 04:44:16	Stupid cat meowing outside my door at daft o'clock!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 04:56:46	It's 5am and I'm wide awake, I'm gonna be dead in the morning when I have to get up!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-26 14:26:02	@MUFC_83 please tell me you don't watch that shit!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-26 16:19:01	@BusbyMUFC  what a cock! Reminds me of when people talk louder and slower to deaf people like they'll understand it better haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-26 21:14:14	Why would he text a journalist that, knowing it would get out? Some people are so gullible!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 08:34:05	What's the betting Anders Lindegaard is gay and is waiting for the approval to come out as this hero he keeps speaking of?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-27 19:01:37	@MUFC_83 they all do it, it's like a new trend to wait til the last day of the window to tell everyone that they were all lucky guesses!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 16:43:06	@MUFC_83 hate people who do this, I regularly get into debates about people claiming to be half Irish/Irish because they're parents are!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 16:46:26	@ecsg94 @mufc_83 haha I just don't get it, it's literally impossible! Irish is a nationality not a race.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 16:54:01	@Dassler_74 @MUFC_83 things like welsh, Irish, Scottish are nationalities so you can't be half of them. They are classed as descendants.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 16:56:35	@ecsg94 nationality is the country you were born in. He was born in England meaning he is English not half Irish because his parents are.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 16:58:00	@dannyh9623 Ando is starting, SAF has already said.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 17:22:30	@ecsg94 that would be classed as your ethnicity which is more of a combination of you're race, nationality and culture.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 17:38:02	@ecsg94 were you born in America and live in Ireland? I would say your circumstances are more appropriate to claim both nationalities.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 17:40:44	@Dassler_74 I think it's a complex issue. You are English as you were born here but have very right to claim the origin of your family.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 17:46:45	@ecsg94 awesome, thats where I don't have a problem you are dual nationality for a reason not because you claim it off your parents
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 18:00:32	@Dassler_74 haha Highlander, I suppose we'd all like to sound more interesting than just English!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 18:52:03	I'm going to the match tonight, If I see anyone taking pictures of themselves with their backs to the pitch, I will headbutt you!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 23:06:16	@MUFC_83 I haven't got a clue what you look like but I seen a guy tonight at the match who I imagine you would look like haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 23:09:57	@MUFC_83 tall? yes haha green parka coat, Ian brown haircut definitely an RG look that!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-28 23:18:27	@MUFC_83 I knew it would some sort of longish coat, you seem that type haha knew you were an Ian Browner!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-30 19:21:19	@sgpstore thank you, just ordered it :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-30 21:48:40	@JoeTaylor84 have u seen the young 14year old Milan signed? Gonna be a brilliant player if he keeps progressing the way he is.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-11-30 23:27:42	@JoeTaylor84 he was doing promo in my college gym the other day, my college is one of the worst in Manchester #smalltime
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-01 12:19:24	@Benno_LUHG corrienationstr thinks we're getting zaha, Rodriguez, hummels, strootman and sneijder in exchange for Nani!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-01 12:31:42	@Benno_LUHG yeah he's got his 'source' on here now, they don't half talk shit! He retweets everyone transfer spec like its the gospel haha x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-01 12:32:09	iPhone 5 has arrived!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-01 12:35:13	@Benno_LUHG hes a dick he blocks everyone that questions him haha ill RT some now one sec, his source is 712insider aswell.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-01 12:37:29	@Benno_LUHG bastards locked his page so you can RT him, everything 712insider says is what he says anyway! Both can't spell for shit.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-01 12:55:10	@Benno_LUHG don't forget the "",, before and after every word haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-01 14:36:05	Chelsea u bunch of cunts, had them to win on my acca!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-01 22:30:47	Tyson Fury tries to call out all the bums in boxin but forgets his own name in that list, cant box for shit and only ever fights shit people
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-01 22:31:23	Put him in a ring with Price or Haye and he'd be on his arse by round 3.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-04 07:39:16	@OfficialTMCD1 at this current time, yes. Don't think anyone else could handle the pressure to instantly succeed.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-04 07:48:38	These early mornings are not my friend!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-04 21:52:48	What's the betting City have the game of their lives on Sunday?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-06 22:39:25	@OfficialTMCD1 do you not think SAF will move Rooney back into midfield, seems reluctant to buy a scholes replacement.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-05 20:37:14	@Lee__Woody I hope your sarcasm is that good that I just cant tell whether you're joking haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-05 20:41:57	@Lee__Woody erm lemme think, no! Hahaha not even Rafa can get the best out of him. It's so sad to see someone of his age lose all quality
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-05 21:41:37	@Benno_LUHG Danny welbeck had a good game also, never stopped!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-03 23:13:33	Mourinho should be the only man considered by United to replace SAF, no question about it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-04 00:11:20	@OfficialTMCD1 hes the only man who could succeed SAF at this moment in time, his ego makes the need greater for him to take over from SAF.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-07 00:21:22	@OfficialTMCD1 I think while he has Rooney who can do the job well, I dont think he'll sign a replacement unless Rooney kicks off again haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-07 23:20:28	Fight Club, Film 4 now!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-07 23:22:17	@AnthonySheehy1 totally agree, absolutely love it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-07 23:29:56	@AnthonySheehy1 yeah he is, seems to go unnoticed by a lot of people.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-08 00:00:41	@BusbyMUFC how have you managed to type all that whilst drinking that much?! I'd be comatosed!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-04 21:38:21	@BusbyMUFC he seemed like such an important player for Benfica, just shows how lesser leagues can make players seem so much better.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-04 23:06:14	Fabrice Muamba is a walking miracle, what a lovely man he is. His gratefulness of being alive is so humbling!
#fabricemuamba
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-08 11:51:35	@BusbyMUFC my birthday is tomorrow so I could either have a really good birthday or a really shit one!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-08 13:49:04	@BusbyMUFC I'm just gonna drown my sorrows tomorrow if we lose haha happy birthday for next week, hope you have a good one!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-09 11:51:35	@ajs612 think that's how everyone feels to be honest, needs to retire this season
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-09 13:22:12	Come on United!!!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-09 14:27:14	Same performance 2nd half please!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-09 16:38:29	@BusbyMUFC gracious in defeat as always!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-09 23:17:15	So glad @JamesArthur23 won tonight, you beautiful, beautiful man! By far the best original artist that X Factor has ever had.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-07 12:57:36	@TheLeverettRant Andersons out injured isn't he with his hamstring?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-09 23:54:18	@michael__oram I love him me, have done from the beginning. There's something about him I find weirdly attractive.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-09 23:57:53	@michael__oram Jayde was shouting at me because I find him attractive haha thank you :) x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-10 00:03:55	@michael__oram no her taste is awful haha 19 now, last year as a teenager :(
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-10 00:11:09	@michael__oram I'm not looking forward to it everyone keeps telling me my life's gonna fly by after this year haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-09 11:32:39	@ajs612 apparently he's not even in the squad
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-09 15:44:05	That late United win has just made my birthday the best ever!!!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-10 14:39:14	@BusbyMUFC poo? they'll be crying themselves to sleep after that insult haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-13 19:54:52	What a load of rubbish, apparently the average for car insurance is £1500 for young women. Bollocks, I was quoted £7000 #ITVTonight
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-13 20:05:06	@Rayfaulkner1 not one person I know that is my age has been quoted less than that, compare the market quoted 125k on a 10yr old Punto.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-13 23:46:05	This 15stone babies programme has got to be a piss take! It's making me feel physically sick.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-11 21:08:34	@michael__oram and to think Wenger chose him over a young Hazard!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-10 17:47:23	@Benno_LUHG bullshit! they celebrated in front of the united supporters just the segregation between the two sets of fans was very close.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-09 16:26:49	@BusbyMUFC great birthday present for me!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-09 16:38:11	City fans resorting to Munich as insults, gracious in defeat as always! #Bitter
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-14 21:21:26	Why does my Twitter keep favouriting people's tweets! Anyone else's doing it?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-12 08:44:00	@OfficialTMCD1 the only thing is, he wants to play central and he won't get that at utd plus he can't do anything on the left wing.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-12 15:36:56	@fidan_x a car? How the hell did it fall over when she touched it?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-12 15:40:14	@fidan_x oh a cat! I was thinking then this person must be strong if they pushed a car over haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-15 14:39:46	Anita had a brilliant game today.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-15 18:27:19	Might have to get one of them festive feast boxes from Pizza Hut! #hankmarvin
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-15 22:51:02	Suarez is such an ugly bastard!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-15 23:34:16	@JoeTaylor84 typical city fan said to me before: you'd be 13th if you didn't have RvP, my reply was: but we have got RvP?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-15 23:47:17	@JoeTaylor84 exactly, welbeck would have had a few goals by now if he'd had a regular spot. Typical city fan trying to pick holes in utd.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-16 00:03:32	Does anyone know what time Amir Khans fight actually starts at and not just the program?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-13 12:08:14	@BusbyMUFC you can get paid for retweets if you open up a business account apparently, something like £1.20 a retweet!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-13 12:19:12	@BusbyMUFC just people retweeting your tweets, some guy was doing it and got paid £600 at a time into his PayPal account off twitter.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-13 13:12:27	@BusbyMUFC (1/2) think they eventually shut his account down because he told everyone but all he did was sign up for a business account...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-13 13:13:06	@BusbyMUFC instead of a personal account and entered his PayPal, he print screened his account and shown us, £600 at a time going in!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-16 13:39:33	Subway Surfers is by far a better game than Temple Run!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-16 15:25:13	Townsend has an uncanny resemblance to Obertan, not only looks wise but in his playing style!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-16 20:50:52	@Benno_LUHG apparently he told Georgie Thompson in an interview that he wants to end his career in England.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-17 20:27:54	@shazia_dar my mum dressed me like this haha sure she hated me! http://t.co/0ONHCWQa
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-16 21:13:01	@Benno_LUHG I think it may have been last year when she still worked for SSN and he said something about returning to the premier league.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-17 20:52:45	@shazia_dar haha I wasn't! Looked like a little Victorian kid in this. Love how all mums dressed their kids like this in the 90's
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-17 21:53:50	@shazia_dar I know, my mum told me that was the fashion! What in like 1910? Haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-17 23:33:10	@Benno_LUHG boxer every time, so easy to train!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-17 23:56:08	@Benno_LUHG Labradors are very giddy! Few family members have Boxers and they are so well behaved. German sheps are always a good choice.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-18 00:03:40	@Benno_LUHG always best to get dogs about spring time as its easier to train them, I have a massive Neapolitan Mastiff!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-17 19:32:33	@rioferdy5 quick #AskRioFerdy5, when's @Cristiano coming back to man Utd?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-18 17:31:15	@Benno_LUHG not at the min as its a new phone, she's a lot nicer looking than most neo's though not as saggy and has piercing blue eyes..
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-18 17:32:36	@Benno_LUHG not practical dogs to be inside either as they slaver not stop!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-18 17:40:49	@BusbyMUFC I know it's a bit late but only one destination in England he would go plus we are looking at long term replacements for evra
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-18 17:49:23	@BusbyMUFC think Nike would play a big part in this deal, couldn't imagine him ever playing for city he loves SAF and Utd too much.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-19 21:43:14	Chelsea fans still singing Champions of Europe? Sitting 3rd in league 10 points behind Utd and haven't qualified from the CL group stages!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-19 21:45:23	You also lost to Corinthians leaving Utd the only English team to win that cup, beating Leeds 5-1 does not warrant singing that song.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-18 20:55:39	If you haven't seen Walk the Line before, stick Film4 on at 9pm. Brilliant film about the struggles of Johnny Cash' life.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-18 21:27:48	@BusbyMUFC yeah but you're missing walk the line!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-18 23:12:12	@Cristiano you could come back to Manchester United and we can all celebrate it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-21 14:13:57	@BusbyMUFC he did the same against sporting when he scored, still agree with you though. Think he realises he made a mistake by leaving.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-20 09:03:22	@Benno_LUHG I don't understand how anyone can support more than one team, it's not possible.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-22 20:54:27	Ronaldo just doesn't look himself when he's playing anymore, where's the player that took every fucker on and had the desire to win?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-22 23:56:49	What the fuck was that shit at the end of MOTD?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-23 01:05:45	@JoeTaylor84 I think SAF would do all he could to get him back if he's serious about leaving.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-23 01:17:38	@JoeTaylor84 I dont actually think he'll come back either but somehow I think if he did leave the glazers would let SAF have his last hurrah
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-23 01:18:28	@Benno_LUHG it might be all sorted haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-23 01:28:53	@JoeTaylor84 read a tweet before saying Mou would prob want to manage Portugal in WC14 as it prob will be ronaldo's last, could make sense&gt;&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-23 01:29:36	@JoeTaylor84 for Ronaldo to come back now and then after Mou has managed Portugal for couple of years to succeed SAF
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-23 16:53:25	@Benno_LUHG Williams intentionally booted the ball at the back of RvP's head which SAF thinks is dangerous as it could have broke his neck
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-22 17:47:55	Celebrity Come Dine with Me, featuring Bianca Gascoigne, is sending me west constantly hearing my name thinking they're talking to me!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-23 12:27:13	@OfficialTMCD1 couldn't they sort that put with giving him a higher % of his image rights?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-23 12:29:20	@OfficialTMCD1 haha I'm not, I know realistically it'll never happen but just wondering whether that would be a big part of his wages?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-23 12:37:20	@OfficialTMCD1 does it ever work with SAF when it comes to midfielders haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-21 08:46:42	My road had a power cut last night, it's safe to say my little sister shit her load thinking the world was gonna end!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-21 14:06:16	@Benno_LUHG SAF wouldn't be as silly as to not put a buy back clause in there, SAF also said we'd be first choice for him no doubt about it
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-22 22:58:54	@OfficialTMCD1 is this another one of you're attempts at a joke? Haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-22 23:06:18	Can't stand Alan Hansen, such an arrogant, smug prick! MOTD
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-23 16:57:31	@Benno_LUHG yeah I agree very stupid thing to do, when you see the replay watch Williams face he even looks at RvP before doing it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-23 17:02:15	.@piersmorgan miskicked? You can see the intention when Williams looks at RvP before it. Stick to your shit tv programmes you fat prick.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-23 17:04:11	Are people questioning why Ronaldo wasn't banned for his shot at Lehmann's face? Williams was intentional after the whistle, Ronny's a shot!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-24 00:29:23	I actually feel physically sick after seeing that twitter account. Would quite happily string that guy up and torture the sick bastard!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-24 13:54:24	Every bastard year, I get ill at Christmas!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-24 22:50:24	Why's no one got Baileys on the go and some sort of FIFA night for Christmas Eve? #sortitout
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-25 12:50:26	Merry Christmas everyone, hope you's all have a lovely day!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-25 01:39:54	@tancredipalmeri sneijder to spurs? Was hoping for something massive like Ronaldo to United! Messi to West Ham haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-25 16:34:09	To the minority who question why we celebrate Christmas and are to ignorant to understand everyone has different beliefs, fuck off!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-25 17:10:14	Absolutely starving, can't wait to demolish this Christmas dinner!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-25 17:46:27	@michael__oram I upset myself sometimes haha merry Christmas :) x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-25 12:49:51	@Benno_LUHG that's lovely that bracelet, have a good day :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-25 17:38:53	Home Alone 3 is by far the best out of them all!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-25 17:41:09	@michael__oram can't stand Macaulay Culkin haha think the kid in this one is dead cute!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-26 14:07:16	I think we could see the rout today that we've all been waiting for, Newcastle without Tiote, Cabaye and Ben Arfa.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-26 14:59:49	@GHTT_ download the skyfire app and then use any of the normal sites you would usually use.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-29 13:57:28	@BusbyMUFC @dung_flung_who skyfire app will let you watch all normal streams on iPad/iPhone
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-30 00:03:12	Last retweet is me all over! cannot stand people eating loud, breathing loud, licking lips, tapping. Anything basically so don't do it!

479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-30 02:18:59	Hate it when I'm over tired and I can't sleep, might go for a drive!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-30 13:44:56	@Benno_LUHG they didn't actually pay that for him, it was a ploy to make the glazers look like they were investing. £250,000 was the fee.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-31 19:56:50	Fuck off Gail Platt you annoying little twat! #corrie
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-31 21:10:50	I may have just scored one of the best goals on FIFA and the little fucker left before I could save it to my replay theatre!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-30 23:23:09	Watching MOTD2, got to say RvP's goal was reminiscent of Ronaldo's left footed strike V Everton!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-01 02:40:50	Yet another family get together that my dad has ruined!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2012-12-31 05:02:59	A normal sleeping pattern wouldn't go a miss #wideawake
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-01 13:51:45	Jones and Fortune did brilliantly for that goal. #WBAvFUL
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-03 14:35:38	Why does my sister insist on ringing me when I'm on FIFA?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-02 00:33:28	@shazia_dar have you found out where it is yet? It's the building behind that massive brick wall on Moseley road, you have to turn right...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-02 00:33:52	@shazia_dar at the lights just before the Manchester Uni campus.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-02 00:38:28	@shazia_dar yeah it's the building behind that massive wall, just turn right before the residence at the lights n it takes you to the centre
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-02 00:44:31	@shazia_dar no problem, it is a very well hidden centre I only know it because of tournaments I've had there. Good luck with the exams there
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-02 00:50:47	@shazia_dar football tournaments when I was in primary school, you won't need luck you'll be fine :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-02 13:04:55	@corrienationstr he didn't turn down arsenal and Chelsea they turned him down because of the wages he wants.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-04 16:24:53	@BusbyMUFC @footballfact101 it's a myth that united paid £7mil for bebe to make it look like the glazers were investing, the fee was 250,000
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-04 16:26:03	@corrienationstr no he's not he's only just started training today.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-04 21:21:45	@stevebez10 @theleverettrant are you's on about what Peter Bonde said?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-04 21:27:57	@TheLeverettRant @stevebez10 just stating how himself and lindegaard are frustrated at him being 2nd choice to De Gea
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-04 21:33:09	@TheLeverettRant @stevebez10 haha himself being Peter Bonde who made the comments, would be quite funny if he was Bi Polar though!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-04 21:39:01	@stevebez10 @theleverettrant Denmarks coaching assistant, said that he's disappointed that SAF is rotating the keepers so much.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-04 21:42:23	@TheLeverettRant @stevebez10 he must be able to see that De Gea is the more talented of the two, lindegaard is a bog standard back up!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-05 13:39:54	@Benno_LUHG apparently trying to push for a 75% tax rate aswell for millionaires.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-05 20:54:27	@corrienationstr @manunited1love good box to box midfielder from shakhtar, breaks play up well and creates an attack. Cracking shot aswell.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-05 20:55:46	@corrienationstr shakhtar aren't a German team they are in the Ukranian league. You're thinking of Shalke
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-05 23:50:11	Someone drop by Demba Ba's house and give him some of this! http://t.co/ugpsVblY

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 19:36:17	@dannyh9623 Dortmund are brilliant on it, the attacking players are rapid. Real Madrid are alright aswell.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 20:34:01	@TheLeverettRant love that there's a mention at the top of the pic saying choo, choo haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 20:37:55	@Lee__Woody you don't play COD?! You haven't lived your life to the fullest haha

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-06 20:17:44	@mikemccarthy @officialtmcd1 and if its the iPhone 5 you have it's in general&gt;keyboard&gt;add new
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-12 19:57:30	@BusbyMUFC just take her wedding ring off when she's asleep and then give it back to her the next day haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-14 01:22:56	“@fidan_x: At Levenshulme High School if you were in M you were the best” cough* S *cough
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-14 01:42:16	@fidan_x no no it was quite clear we were the best, we had the sexy Ms Rowley as head of team!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-09 15:36:32	@BusbyMUFC random but, did you see the clip of Guardiola refusing to shake Ronaldo's hand at Ballon D'Or? Is there something I've missed?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-09 16:10:51	@BusbyMUFC http://t.co/PRYO7kkC 
seems to completely ignore him and you can see him shake his head in sort of disbelief when he turns away
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-09 16:17:02	@BusbyMUFC I thought it was strange, thought I may have missed some sort of argument they'd had in the past. Slightly unprofessional by Pep!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-09 16:18:37	@JunedRT @busbymufc @cristiano very unprofessional by Pep, expected more from him.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-09 16:20:02	@andykeating @busbymufc @cristiano missed that but could well be the reason, still unprofessional from him.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-09 16:59:48	@FootyExpert @busbymufc @cristiano I think he bumps into him and tries to shake hands to apologise but Pep ignores him, pretty childish.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 14:43:24	I'm gonna go out and pound my dog in a minute if she doesn't shut up barking!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 14:52:04	@Benno_LUHG tbf though last year everyone said Messi should win it because he won more trophies, Ronaldo has won more trophies and now..
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 14:52:23	@Benno_LUHG everyone is saying Messi should win it because he has more goals.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 15:51:00	(1/2) Brendan Rodgers on Suarez: 'yesterday was a game he was up for because it was street football for him and he enjoys that type of game'
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 15:52:22	(2/2) Could Rodgers have been any more disrespectful towards Mansfield? Street football? Yes they may be a lower league team but they are..
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 15:53:36	More of a team than Liverpool will ever be. At least Suarez can try and justify his handball by saying he thought it was 'street football'.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 16:05:49	@millybyford I probably wouldn't even get in the garden with her without her pinning me to the floor! She has barked all day til 2:30 :@
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 16:07:30	@MrScripto @MrScripto nothing, apart from being Spanish!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 16:20:50	@millybyford shes not well at the min, think she's got cherry eye. She can't see a thing got to ring the vets when it's open and book her in
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 16:24:25	@millybyford it's horrible, she's suffering constantly at the minute with everything don't think she's gonna last much longer :(
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 16:26:15	@millybyford yeah she's 7 in August, they're life span at the most is 8-10 but very rare for them to live past 7 x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 16:28:31	@BusbyMUFC think its unfair criteria every year, Messi won it last year because he won more trophies now that ronaldo has won more...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 16:29:37	@BusbyMUFC trophies than Messi did, this year it's based on individual achievements and goals are more important!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-07 16:30:00	@BusbyMUFC ronaldo must be pissed off that he's in the same generation as Messi haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-13 15:32:38	Where's Martin Lipton? need to ask him if he still thinks Rafael and Welbeck aren't good enough for United.
#Clueless
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-13 16:21:18	@Clare_29 it's fake, poorly photoshopped.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-13 16:26:09	Poor, poor decision by Wenger to play Diaby today. Quite clearly not match fit.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-13 19:15:04	@corrienationstr how have you managed to say Liverpool are interested when the article says they're not?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-09 22:35:28	Oh how I love this film! #TheNotebook
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-09 23:00:16	The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-09 23:00:41	That has to be one of the best quotes from The Notebook!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-09 23:02:07	Along with...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-09 23:03:03	You tell me when I'm being an arrogant son of a bitch and I tell you when you're being a pain in the arse, which you are 99% of the time.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-09 23:07:44	@Strummer_86 haha I love him, have you seen him in Blue Valentine? He looks like a serial booby feeler in that haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-09 23:08:32	Right guys its the sad bit, lets turn it off #TheNotebook
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-09 23:25:53	@Strummer_86 haha blue valentine is on tomorrow, watch him in that one! He looks like a proper Pervy Pete! Fat drunk with receding hairline.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-15 17:07:01	@JoeTaylor84 random question, do you watch any of the Eredivisie?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-15 17:31:35	@JoeTaylor84 oh it's just a watched quite a few games of Feyenoord a while back and Jordy Clasie stood out for me but not seen many games...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-15 17:32:50	@JoeTaylor84 recently and just wanted a general idea of how he's doing from someone who actually knows about football haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-15 17:35:42	@JoeTaylor84 did you get both them tweets? Keeps telling me there's an error!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-15 17:36:47	@JoeTaylor84 yeah I've seen quite a bit of Maher too, from what I seen of Clasie he looks like he's gonna be a real star.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-15 18:57:57	Anyone else notice the 'congrats' balloon in Wills Hospital room? #Hollyoaks
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-10 16:57:18	@Benno_LUHG I read this 'rents' and thought you meant you were cooking for Chelsea fans then realised you meant parents! Hahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-10 17:03:40	@Benno_LUHG hahaha couldn't stop laughing at it, sure your parents would love to be known as rent boys!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-15 20:49:04	@BusbyMUFC yeah he's a fat bastard!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-15 22:45:12	@Benno_LUHG they both have a very low buy out clauses if QPR are relegated, apparently
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-15 22:50:16	@Benno_LUHG M'Vila is decent but his attitude stinks, I haven't heard great reviews of Remy the consensus is that he's pretty average.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-08 13:12:42	@BusbyMUFC I'd rather have Jonny Evans than Piquè, he was dropped from Barca though because Pep didn't get on with him.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-17 23:02:25	This video has had me in stitches!

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-17 20:42:04	@millybyford make sure there's not a kidney or brain in there!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-17 20:46:24	@millybyford ah I see, at least you can see what you're eating haha xx
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-17 20:47:42	Can everyone stop wetting themselves over Waterloo Road, the programmes shit and and the actors are shit!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-17 20:49:13	@millybyford haha she's easily satisfied, I see why you've stuck with her ;)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-17 20:56:22	@millybyford bring it I'll do you's both in...

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-22 20:45:28	@dannyh9623 probably Hooper, he loves his strikers haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-22 21:04:54	@MrScripto @mufclander think he means Wanyama haha what about Jordy Clasie of Feyenoord?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-22 21:12:48	@MrScripto @mufclander ah i see, I have to admit I have only seen Clasie a handful of times but seems a very good player for his age.

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-24 18:31:14	@millybyford I've got tweetbot, it was £2 just gotta wait and see if it works now haha x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-23 18:21:30	@MrScripto I personally don't think he's great, his tackling is decent and picks up the ball in good areas. His downfall is his passing.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-23 18:47:23	@MUFCInNews his passing ability isn't great and he struggles to get the ball out of his feet quick enough
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-19 14:48:45	@PetdoggPepe yeah I'm good thanks, yeah she's still playing she's doing really well aswell in the cup semi finals I think x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-23 20:54:13	How have Chelsea fans even got the cheek to sing 'Champions of Europe' hahaha 😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-23 21:27:59	I'd have kicked that ball boy too if I was Hazard! What's he playing at lying on the ball?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-23 21:42:40	@JoeTaylor84 the little shit deserved a good kicking for lying on the ball in the first place!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-24 10:58:48	@Benno_LUHG hes not good enough I don't think! His passing is a big let down.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-24 11:02:49	@Benno_LUHG @pat_cunningham yeah it was said straight away he was there for Fallon, much better options than Wanyama.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-26 14:18:34	@benno_luhg sell Ince for £250,000 because he's not good enough and then resign him for £6mil, sounds about right for LFC
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-26 14:21:11	@BusbyMUFC @pearcesmiths

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-28 17:47:11	Highlight of my day has been finding out we break up from college next Thursday! 😝🙊
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-28 21:59:26	@RealRed19 @leelongson that's not the full picture of their careers though, I love clevz but wilshere is the better player.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-28 22:06:23	@RealRed19 currently he is over hyped but will be World class, 3 years younger and is naturally a number 10! Carrying AFC at the minute.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-01-28 22:27:40	@RealRed19 if they don't win anything I can guarantee he'll leave, fuck all that bullshit about loyalty. Clevz is injury prone too!

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-01 14:57:12	@ProudRed85 lazy journalism, doesn't cross their mind that maybe Sorensen at 36, wants to leave for regular football.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-01 15:02:24	@ProudRed85 I'll be seriously pissed off if he's sold, Barca, Real and other top teams want him for a reason. WC in couple of years!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-02 17:15:32	@Benno_LUHG my point exactly, if Begovic is coming in its for Anders. Anders is an average keeper and doesn't give De Gea enough competition
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-02 17:21:25	@Benno_LUHG Amos being on the bench more than Anders recently says a lot about who's leaving. Anders has stated he's not happy being 2nd.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-02 22:33:24	@ProudRed85 I was at the Southampton game and the atmosphere was shocking, bar the stretty end. Too many day trippers.

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-02 22:42:35	@ProudRed85 I want a season ticket soonish but no chance I'm paying for one unless its in Stretty. Poor support from other stands.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-02 22:45:42	@JoeTaylor84 I think if we buy a new keeper it's to replace Anders, has anything been said about why Amos was on the bench instead?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-02 22:54:30	@JoeTaylor84 too much noise coming from his camp about not being happy being no.2. Thinks he's going tbh.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-02 22:55:10	@19timescounting @proudred85 I sat infront of a woman who sat and spoke about what you can and can't eat at slimming world for 1st half...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-02 22:55:50	@19timescounting @proudred85 personally don't understand people who go and don't support the team and you can't stand up and sing in...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-02 22:56:11	@19timescounting @proudred85 other stands because everyone around you moans and tells you to sit down!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-02 22:57:03	@ProudRed85 yeah need to sort getting tickets for away games, looks a brilliant atmosphere!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-02 23:10:37	@19timescounting @proudred85 that shouldn't be an obvious statement, 76,000 people in OT yet only the stretty end can be heard.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-01 21:22:32	@RealRed19 have you got your little rant off your chest now haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-05 18:56:07	@HumaBabar she didn't have a great time in school it was the one who had that video posted round of her so I wouldn't mention it haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-05 23:39:35	@fidan_x not true, no where in the bible does it state its wrong. All about peoples interpretations of the words in the Old Testament :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-02 21:23:08	@JoeTaylor84 my dads watching casualty! Fucking casualty! Missing the Real Madrid match for this shit program.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-06 17:57:03	@Benno_LUHG don't see why all the big fuss is being made, currently Baines is a better LB. It's all sentiment as to why he's still in team.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-06 18:00:30	@Benno_LUHG me neither, definitely won't be in the starting 11 come the World Cup. Got tore a new one by an average Valencia this season.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-06 18:08:53	@Benno_LUHG definitely, that's why Beckham was still very much appreciated in the latter stages of his England career.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-06 19:02:29	@michael__oram will be good to see how Wilshere, Cleverley and Rooney link up. Quick one touch passing is what in hoping to see!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-06 19:08:50	@michael__oram haha you muppet, Wilshere's the better player but no where near what people make him out to be, yet!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-06 20:42:07	What the fuck is going on with Hart's kicking! #engvbra
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-04 01:14:53	Beyonce is something else when it comes to our female species! Endless talent and absolutely beautiful.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-04 01:20:59	Destiny's Child will never be the same again, will always be known now as Beyonce and two backing singers.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-04 01:23:09	It's actually quite sad to see Kelly and Michelle trying to re-ignite their careers off the back of Beyonce's success.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-04 01:28:16	Apart from Kelly's appearance on X Factor and the shit songs she's realised what has she done?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-03 20:28:59	Well that Impossible film is a little bit emotional isn't it?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-03 20:54:26	Source Code is on at 9, top film!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-03 22:46:06	There's something a little bit beautiful about Sturridge!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-03 22:47:12	Stevie G's goal though.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-03 22:51:06	@derahn each to their own haha I know myself that he's not great looking think its just because he's talented lol
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-04 13:36:11	@ClareA32 2 champions league match one of which was played in England. Has to be CFCvFCB
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-04 13:58:12	@ProudRed85 people actually believe the 7mil price tag which is why they are so hard on him. £250,000 was his price, it was all a ploy...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-04 13:58:31	@ProudRed85 by the Glazers to make it look like they were investing in the team.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-04 16:58:42	@millybyford oh is that what they're for, silly me haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-04 16:14:17	You know you have thick hair when you wash it at 12:30pm yesterday and it still be wet now, 28 hours later!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-04 18:07:59	@jayne_travis I thought that was hair brushes haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-04 18:14:36	@jayne_travis I sings into fans for ultimate performance, gives my voice that edge to it haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-07 17:28:03	@NapzMusic if you do, book it in a small group otherwise they make you drive in a line behind each other and you're not allowed to overtake!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-07 17:40:15	@NapzMusic nah my sister went and she said it was a big let down, she got stuck behind some kid who drove 2mph haha defo book privately!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-07 17:47:42	@NapzMusic i know haha I did it in turkey, they were more arsed about taking shit photos of you going through puddles!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-07 18:06:25	@NapzMusic me too, wouldn't be a good idea for me to go out in a small group I'd get sold off for a few camels and never come back hahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-07 21:02:47	Hahahahaha this takes the piss! http://t.co/Zv9Vhu77
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-07 21:23:01	@Benno_LUHG I heard €16m a year AFTER tax!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-05 16:11:20	@Benno_LUHG tbf that Indy guy is normally quite good. Not sure if he's just lucky though
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-08 01:14:57	Driving at night, listening to an old skool RnB CD #chilled
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-05 17:43:47	@HumaBabar remember miss green who taught in our school for a while? That's her brother in that band.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-08 21:56:51	@Benno_LUHG didn't like the ending too much, maybe it's because I'm a girl and actually wanted to see them get back together properly haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-08 22:03:49	@Benno_LUHG I know that one scene at the wedding is proper sad, he look devastated! If I was her I'd pretend I remembered him haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-08 22:19:58	@RealRed19 we're one of the only countries to allow people to claim for children that don't even live here, what kind of fuckery is this?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-09 11:08:44	@Benno_LUHG that's almost as bad as socks with sandals haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-09 18:04:05	@dannyh9623 Neuer is best in the world in my opinion.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-11 12:41:04	Gym time 😊
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-13 13:01:11	Don't forget everyone, no meat today!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-13 18:03:32	@NapzMusic we all know that landed on the floor haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-13 18:15:57	@NapzMusic yep that must be the reason ;) hahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-14 13:01:15	@ProudRed85 don't think he pointed at them but apparently put his hands up to them to apologise
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-13 00:13:45	Don't even know which direction my life is heading.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-13 00:15:52	How are we supposed to strive towards success when we aren't even sure what we want in life?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-13 18:04:51	Real Madrid v United &gt;&gt;&gt; Valentines day
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-13 18:09:53	@NapzMusic yhyh course you are haha I can't make pancakes for shit! End up with a big plate of mush lol
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-15 23:22:15	@Benno_LUHG what's he said?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-15 23:25:12	@Benno_LUHG would be pretty stupid of him if he had said that considering how much we've stuck by him through injuries!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-15 23:56:16	FIFA or go for a drive? #boredom
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-16 00:58:15	@ProudRed85 why the fuck would people sell a ticket for a game as big as that! Would love to go if I could
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-13 21:59:30	1-1 away from home? I'll take that. De Gea was class tonight!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-13 22:57:13	@Blakes_1 @joetaylor84 I'm assuming he wants it to be true, so they stay away from De Gea haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-13 23:08:51	@Blakes_1 @joetaylor84 I thought they may have gone in for Courtois, lot of rumours that Chelsea may let him go.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-13 23:12:05	@Blakes_1 @joetaylor84 I agree it would be madness, brilliant young talent. Chelsea going in for Butland says a lot though I think
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-16 13:08:55	What a shit Saturday, need something to do!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-16 15:26:56	Zaha is having a brilliant game! Who the hell said he didn't have an end product?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-16 15:28:37	@JoeTaylor84 I was thinking the exact same, proving to have an end product too. Wasted in championship at the minute.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-17 17:33:42	What was with all these people wearing shorts and flip flops today, it's still like minus 4 out there. Wrap up you dick heads!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-16 18:58:09	@FootballMcD I agree if its to United haha don't want him going to one of our rivals that actually compete for trophies and improving them!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-16 21:07:21	Garlic Camembert melt with hard bread for starters and then lamb chops, mash and vegetables for the main. I am a chef for the night!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-17 00:23:19	It's not what you're running from, it's what you're running to.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-18 21:06:14	I drive round to a pub and get ID'd, where's the logic in that? It's very rare you get a 17year old driving! I'm 19 for fuck sake.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-18 23:12:48	@AranSohal don't do it, doesnt mix well!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-20 09:03:05	@CorcoranPearse his dad even made a statement saying his life was made a misery from 2001 onwards by a notorious gangster...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-13 00:14:25	I believe everyone is born to do something and for a reason, I just haven't found what that is yet.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-13 00:17:06	Need to go for a drive!!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-10 17:02:59	Can't wait for this Sunday dinner! Starvin' Marvin
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-21 15:04:24	@ProudRed85 one thing I remember him saying a while back was as long as united keep offering him contracts, he'll keep signing them.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-10 22:20:09	I'd rather be unknown by most, then be known for the wrong reasons.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-10 23:17:56	@JoeTaylor84 Neuer and Casillas are better than Hart! This season DDG and Begovic have been better. All praise gone to his head, too cocky.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 16:43:39	My mums a wrong'en! Get in from college and she's spent all day cleaning and rearranging the tins in the cupboard hahaha #OCDfamily
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 21:12:51	Can you imagine how much better Wilshere would be if he was actually in a decent team with world class players?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-15 00:40:40	Starving now, need somewhere that's nice to eat and open at this time!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-15 01:05:06	No matter how tired I am, I can never go asleep at a normal time!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 21:55:19	@kiranh0405 me too! Don't drink, don't make a show of myself, don't sleep with anything that moves and I don't go on holiday to drink! Haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 21:56:29	@michael__oram think if you's carry on the way you's are, I'd be worried about him leaving.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 22:00:13	@michael__oram he's carrying your team at the minute, selling another of your quality players will only make you worse.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 22:01:11	@kiranh0405 😒 I do that all the time, I have to look after my OLDER sister when we go out to make sure she's ok!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 22:02:37	@michael__oram thought it was a strange reply considering you love him. You can see he loves AFC but how much can he take at a young age.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 22:06:08	@michael__oram it's sad actually to see you's go from a brilliant team to an average one at best. The rivalry between us and AFC has gone.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 22:10:51	@kiranh0405 definitely, I'm just an odd 19 year old. Never been much of a rebel haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 22:16:20	@michael__oram at the minute you's look average, potential to be better but the drive is missing. Bould needs to sort ur defence out.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 22:17:37	@kiranh0405 the only thing that excites me about manchester is Route 66 outdoor cinema! Looks awesome.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 22:32:52	@kiranh0405 I only found out about it 2 days ago! I love karting my uncles used to own a track so used to do it every week.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 22:41:36	@kiranh0405 no not yet thinking of going soonish though when I get some time off. Karting 2000 in Gorton and big one in Trafford.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 22:43:03	Don't care, Rihanna is shocking live.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 22:45:12	@BusbyMUFC I said this earlier, he clearly loves AFC but how much more can he take at such a young age? Carrying them at the minute.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 22:53:38	@CorcoranPearse @busbymufc the pressure of that on someone so young can't be healthy though, can't see him sticking round for much longer.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 22:59:03	@Kevo0h @busbymufc looks like someone won't have a left nut soon haha almost certain he'll leave.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 23:22:53	@CorcoranPearse @busbymufc that may be correct, just don't be too surprised if he's not around for this English core "future".
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 23:29:18	@CorcoranPearse @busbymufc Stevie G would definitely have left years ago if he hadn't of got involved with the wrong people in Liverpool.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-17 20:57:51	Can't beat Chicken Maryland for dinner!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-19 23:52:52	@MU689908 only so much he can take before getting pissed off that he's carrying the team. A lot of pressure for someone so young.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-20 00:11:17	A visit to Route 66 outdoor cinema in Trafford, is in order. Looks top!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-20 00:17:27	@CorcoranPearse he handed in a transfer request after they won the Champions League. Definitely wanted to leave.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-20 00:36:13	@CorcoranPearse it was public knowledge his life was made a misery by dodgy people in Liverpool. If it was just bright lights why can't...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-20 00:36:56	@CorcoranPearse it be the same case for Wilshere? Arsenal haven't just won CL either to persuade him to stay.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-17 23:26:21	@BusbyMUFC I think Stan's a bellend but seriously can't see how that tweet meant Besty? He put 'Mr' before liver scirosis which...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-17 23:27:24	@BusbyMUFC means he personified the disease so he would have to say you know 'him'. He was tweeted about alcohol and he's basically...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-17 23:27:53	@BusbyMUFC said he doesn't do it because it causes that disease. Seriously all blown out of proportion. Still a cock though!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-17 23:30:57	I agree with most that Stan is a cock, but can't see how people have took that tweet as a dig at Best?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-17 23:32:06	He has personified the disease by putting 'Mr' before it, hence why he has put think you know 'him'. He was asked about drinking and his...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-17 23:33:06	answer was basically saying he hasnt had a drink because it causes that disease and insinuating that the person he tweeted knows that.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-17 23:33:28	I may be wrong but that's my interpretation of it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-17 23:33:53	He's still a dogging, wife beater though!
#stan
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-17 23:34:50	@JoeTaylor84 read my other tweets, maybe I'm naïve but think its been misunderstood because the guy he tweeted it to a utd fan.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-18 00:02:30	Shouldn't have had that sleep earlier, wide awake now!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-20 09:03:56	@CorcoranPearse they may end up on a level playing field with the Chelsea's but will that be because they lower there standards due to...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-20 09:05:00	@CorcoranPearse not being able to invest because of FFP or will Arsenal actually invest there team instead of selling? I don't know where...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-20 09:05:52	@CorcoranPearse JW will go, whether its abroad or not but Barca may well want him. He could even stay in the premier league, it's be hard
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-20 09:06:38	@CorcoranPearse for him as he's an arsenal fan but arsenal fans can't expect him to stay in a declining team instead of progressing in...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-20 09:06:43	@CorcoranPearse his career.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-20 12:39:43	@CorcoranPearse you don't think they'll decline? They've been declining for the last 8 years. Sellers club that's what they've become.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-20 12:40:30	@CorcoranPearse he may love arsenal but he'll also want to win things in his career and at the moment the chances are slim at arsenal.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-20 15:09:24	@CorcoranPearse he might not leave just yet, if give him two more seasons at the most. A player of his quality deserves better.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-20 15:51:32	Hate bastards that leave the game when they are getting beat #FIFA
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-23 11:39:04	@MU689908 how bad is that daft blonde bint that speaks between matches!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-23 12:15:00	I wish someone would retweet that Oscar Pistorius tweet about going full combat in the pantry, I've not seen it enough yet.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-23 14:21:11	Bryan Ruiz is a very underrated player.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-23 14:37:17	@MU689908 is it true hes struggling cause one leg is slightly shorter than the other? Don't understand how it didn't trouble him last season
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-23 15:02:43	@MU689908 only seen it today but just can't understand how it hasn't been picked up on earlier if it causes pain.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-23 15:27:39	@Benno_LUHG VIPBOX link 3 is decent
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-23 15:31:22	@Benno_LUHG not really, quite a decent stream from setanta.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-23 15:33:58	@Benno_LUHG yeah has a few advert things that get in the way first, have to wait 30secs before u can click them off x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-24 14:44:02	Brilliant challenge by Cahill
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-24 16:45:12	@AmyCorrigan24 oh shit I completely forgot about that!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-24 16:46:51	@AmyCorrigan24 yeah, what time we gotta be in college for?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-24 16:49:39	@AmyCorrigan24 aw damn that means ill have to bring a bag! I've still not got walking boots, wearing my wellies again haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-25 07:33:00	@AmyCorrigan24 found out off josh that we have to be in at 9:15 x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-02 16:55:08	4-0, that'll do Donkey, that'll do.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-02 17:01:44	I wonder if the fickle fans still believe...

A) Rooney needs selling 
B) Kagawa is still just a shirt seller
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-02-27 21:59:40	It's safe to say that 'people like us' programme makes the whole of Manchesters population look like absolute tramps.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-03 00:52:06	@Benno_LUHG to be fair I doubt Fergie would come out and say he might re join just before tue, could you imagine the reaction and backlash?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-03 14:39:01	@ProudRed85 didn't say he was close, said it was probably a ploy for a new deal. Wouldn't admit he is going to join anyway til its definite.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-03 17:39:34	Clattenburg's hair is atrocious, needs a new barber!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-03 17:57:46	Bale had a very average game, bar his goal he didn't do much.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-05 19:28:44	@DannyJRoyle tell me about it, little less confident now that he's not starting!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-01 13:11:55	Nandos, it's been a while 🐔
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-05 21:42:04	The Ref's done us tonight, should have had 2 penalties and was never a red!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-05 21:43:15	Fair play to Mourinho.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-05 22:12:34	@ClareA32 also the same ref that wasn't allowed to referee the Spain v Portugal match because he has close Spanish relations and is biased.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-06 14:57:50	@AranSohal the stigma attached to this subject is what stops us talking about it. I can relate, suffered from both since the age of 15.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-06 15:03:34	@AranSohal I never spoke about it til I was 16ish when it had gotten too much, was forced into CBT and meds otherwise I was being sectioned&gt;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-06 15:04:08	@AranSohal 4 years later I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-06 15:10:08	@AranSohal yes I'm much better than I was, nearly a year off my medicine. CBT is very good but pushes you to places you don't want to go.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-06 15:13:55	@AranSohal you too.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-06 20:30:00	Can't help but think if we'd have played Pogba, his attitude wouldn't have stunk so much and we'd have had a brilliant player on our hands.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-06 20:33:25	@JoeTaylor84 had a brilliant first half in this game, he's like a brick wall. Would rather have had him in our team over Ando!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-06 20:38:20	@JoeTaylor84 haha id prob do a better job aswell! I used to be a big fan of Ando, too inconsistent though. He was v good before last injury
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-06 20:45:43	@JoeTaylor84 yeah, definitely doesn't try hard enough to get fit or into shape after he's had a set back.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-02 00:27:43	Safe Haven is a brilliant film! Had a whole cinema room to ourselves to make it better :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-03 21:00:30	Gonna get in bed and watch The Tourist.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-02 19:12:28	@JoeTaylor84 surely Jay Tabb has to be a contender for that prize too haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-02 19:18:20	@JoeTaylor84 haha fair enough, there are some dire players in the prem considering the standard of the league.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-03 00:59:17	@JoeTaylor84 honest Q, do you honestly believe Fergie would say any different to that, if it was true? Could you imagine the outrage haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-03 01:03:17	@JoeTaylor84 yeah I think it is unlikely, but then again if he leaves RM I would imagine SAF would sign him just to stop any rivals doing so
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-09 20:54:54	Anyone know if this Skyline film is decent?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-09 20:59:40	@JoeTaylor84 haha cheers i'll give it a miss then, not really a fan of sci-fi anyway.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-09 21:10:06	That Dude in London still at it? Trying to get women on her side by being a self righteous feminist, but instead making all women hate her.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-09 21:16:08	@Zaidiinho she's a ridiculous excuse for a woman!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-09 21:19:46	@Zaidiinho she loves every minute of it aswell which makes it all the more bizarre! Definitely got a screw loose up top.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-09 22:52:31	Why does Alan Hansen insist on looking at people like that? Looks like he's mentally undressing them whilst trying to make witty remarks!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-09 23:02:03	@MrScripto that's a ridiculous amount of money for him!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-10 00:11:49	I hope that €92mil being quoted for Neymar isn't true. Perspective? The same fee got Real Madrid the best player in the world, at the time.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-10 00:12:35	Say what you like about him having more natural talent than Ronaldo and being potentially better, the fact is he may never live up to it.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-10 00:31:51	@AmyCorrigan24 some big riot between Arabs and Somalians. 3 teachers injured, 4 girls in hospital, 22 excluded, 10 in isolation and 7 fights
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-10 00:36:08	@AmyCorrigan24 something to do with the Arabs feel like victims, called the Somalians n****s and it kicked off. Someone pushed ms ogrady...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-10 00:36:20	@AmyCorrigan24 down the stairs apparently :O
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-11 17:07:24	@Benno_LUHG 1:37! Vaguely remember doing a similar one in school.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-12 19:41:02	@kiranh0405 I could sit for hours watching it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-12 19:44:37	Legs are in pain after that gym session; 5k run and 50 squats.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-12 19:45:35	@kiranh0405 I've always wanted to go to the crucible but no one will go with me haha last time I played i wasn't big enough to reach over!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-12 20:12:24	@kiranh0405 I'm pretty good at pool so I imagine I'd be good at potting in snooker just not the positioning haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-10 18:27:57	Valencia is a poor excuse for a football player, been absolutely dire this season.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-10 21:03:22	Limitless on channel 4, very good film.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-15 17:51:09	Bastille's album 'Bad Blood' is amazing!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-14 21:50:21	Someone's done some bad juju on Torres!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-14 22:12:03	@kiranh0405 can't begin to fathom what the hell has happened to him hahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-14 22:16:53	@kiranh0405 completely agree, he used to give our defence the run around when he was at Liverpool.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-17 17:41:06	Looks like someone's forgot to cut the rest of Di Santo's hair, no one chooses to have it like that do they?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-15 23:19:02	@JoeTaylor84 its the weekend after isn't it?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-15 23:21:22	@JoeTaylor84 haha I was panicking thinking we were later in the month then I thought!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-16 00:19:30	You all forgot the first rule of Fight Club!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-16 00:47:07	@JoeTaylor84 did you not know your favourite colour has to be red too, Joe? He's a bit of a cunt that Webby isn't he haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-16 00:49:58	@JoeTaylor84 his argument is weak, what the fuck does it matter where you live? I've lived here all my life but only go to about 10 games.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-16 00:54:41	@JoeTaylor84 don't tell him Salford, he'll prob argue it isn't manchester haha he's obviously looking for an argument.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-16 13:15:07	@TheLeverettRant broke two bones in his back
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-16 13:18:15	Cracking goal by Osman, much deserved goal for Everton.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-16 20:05:20	I can't help but smile when I watch this http://t.co/7SxjlZ1TlC
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-18 23:33:36	@BASTILLEdan have you sampled another song in the intro of Bad Blood? It's driving me insane that I can't think of what song it sounds like!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-18 22:40:16	@JoeTaylor84 only just read this tweet, show the dickhead these stats.

Says it all! http://t.co/U7HCD9WC6h
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-18 22:47:05	@JoeTaylor84 baffles me how he can actually think JT is better! JT can't even get in Chelsea's side and Luiz is good but an awful defender!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-21 23:44:53	Haha this guy makes me laugh 😂 True words spoken though still.

http://t.co/a7BkuecxOv
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-20 20:34:21	@TayaSophie I'm doing that but can only feel it in the tops of my legs haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-20 20:40:18	@TayaSophie I might try it with a light weight bar on my shoulders, see if it does my mum. I'm on day 9, not looking forward to day 30 haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-20 20:45:25	@TayaSophie day 1 killed me too, couldn't walk up stairs properly haha my put some lunges in there with it, see if it helps x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-20 20:53:58	@TayaSophie I know yeah, I don't really speak to anyone though to know when they're back in manchester. Do you? X
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-20 20:56:32	@TayaSophie the only person I speak to from our group is Lauren and that's once every now and then, do you not speak to Havana? X
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-20 21:03:22	@TayaSophie well I can text Lauren, see when she's back from Uni and get her to speak to Hannah. Hopefully get something sorted x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-20 21:36:33	@MU689908 wouldn't mind but they're horrible!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-20 22:15:14	@ProudRed85 hahaha no it's not, it's prob the best film website I've used.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-20 22:27:22	@ProudRed85 yeah do, works on PS3 aswell if you wanna watch it on tv instead of a laptop
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-19 23:53:56	Lion king in theatre is brilliant!!!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-20 23:22:43	@JoeTaylor84 he's brilliant at impressions isn't he, Snape makes me laugh haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-20 23:31:56	@JoeTaylor84 yeah his Pacino was very good as was his David Attenborough.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-20 23:35:46	@JoeTaylor84 on the left, the other is my older sister.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-20 23:47:01	@JoeTaylor84 haha I know. I got the Irish look, she looks foreign! Look a lot more similar when my hairs darker if you look in my new avi.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-23 09:18:08	@TayaSophie Lauren's back the second week in April so I'm assuming from about the 8th. She's gonna speak to Hannah aswell x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-23 00:18:49	@JoeTaylor84 it's a horrible illness that will never be understood by people who haven't experienced it. Hope everything's ok.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-23 00:29:16	@JoeTaylor84 I'm sorry to hear that, its never the easy way out for anyone. I for one wish there wasn't such a stigma attached.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-24 13:38:00	Did Sunday Supplement just say Owen didn't fit in at LFC because he was more middle class and not a scally like Fowler? Hahaha brilliant!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-24 18:16:22	Golf isn't even a proper sport #boring
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-25 16:22:00	It is Moscow out there today!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-03-26 22:08:33	Some people don't half talk some shit on here, you don't know all that you think you know!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-01 22:20:28	People are very quick to judge on here, get your facts straight before making assumptions #NeighbourhoodWatched
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-01 22:42:12	As someone who knew Danny, he was a good man and deserved every bit of help he got from the housing association!

#NeighbourhoodWatched
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-01 22:52:07	@Emma_Reilly_ just so you know his friends and family fund raised for that wedding, she played no part in paying for it.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-01 23:08:03	There's some disgusting snobs in this world, need to get off here before I find one and rochambeau them.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-02 23:45:12	@judeinlondon can't believe how deluded this tweet is. CONTEXT! Either can be used as an insult or as basic skin colour description.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-02 23:46:37	@judeinlondon if you honestly believe that calling someone white can't have negative connotations too, then you need to 'read a book'
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-02 23:48:20	@JoeTaylor84 she makes my blood boil, from what I can gather apparently racism towards white people doesn't exist!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-07 23:19:35	@dannyh9623 that article says February 2012 doesn't it?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-08 22:53:40	@Benno_LUHG I'd rather lose a derby and win the title than win a derby and lose the title.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-08 22:55:47	Lets just put this in perspective... I'd rather win the title and lose a derby than lose the title and win a derby!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-09 19:19:34	@ScoresGoals18 you'll get £15 and your fiver back
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-13 21:07:53	@JoeTaylor84 bit late, get it checked soonish! My auntie grabbed a knife in the sink and now has a splint due to them having to find her...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-13 21:08:22	@JoeTaylor84 tendon and having to pull it back up to her finger to re-attach it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-13 21:37:14	@JoeTaylor84 yeah always best to be safe. Hers didn't bleed too much either, she just couldn't bend it.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-13 22:18:43	@JoeTaylor84 would benefit greatly from being surrounded by better players, always looking to pick a pass but never gets the movement.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-12 12:10:46	@BeautifullyRed skyfire is what I use, think its £1.99
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-12 12:13:03	@BeautifullyRed yeah watch all the football matches on it that aren't televised. Not sure about movies but I assume it would work the same.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-12 12:14:27	@BeautifullyRed no problem
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-10 15:38:29	@ccharlesworth87 @busbymufc definitely East Z East!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-12 22:01:19	Nicolas Cage is an awful actor.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-12 22:13:09	And the film 'Knowing' is dire.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-14 17:13:46	Fabregas is wasted up front.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-11 18:42:33	@ScoresGoals18 he is brilliant but his first touch is a bit iffy. Can be worked on though.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-14 21:02:47	@Blakes_1 @joetaylor84 oh the irony, her bio says 'treat people how you wish to be treated' and 'say no to bullies' hahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-11 19:33:17	The ref keeps getting in the way in the NUFC v SLB match, there's a whole pitch and he insists on standing right next to the play!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-11 21:00:20	@jackcoleman7 the awful one where his face falls apart in two when the surgeon lets go of it? Made me physically sick!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-11 21:16:03	@jackcoleman7 yeah probably the worst I've seen, don't understand why the surgeons allowed someone to film in there!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-11 21:19:58	@jackcoleman7 yeah I read somewhere on the link I seen it on, that he died 3 days later.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-11 21:21:50	@jackcoleman7 I know can't imagine what he went through in them 3 days, I'd rather have been euthanised.

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-22 23:56:23	@shazia_dar thank you, just a trial one whilst in college. It counts if we pass but doesn't if we fail haha bonus!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-20 21:32:45	How Tyson Fury is still undefeated is beyond me.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-23 08:14:33	@shazia_dar yeah not too sure if I want to go in the Navy it's just a good qualification to have haha thank you though x

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-24 07:45:00	@JessicaRosexo1 Hey, not coming in today don't feel too well so won't be able to take you's Lyme Park.

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-28 20:54:08	Love &amp; Other Drugs is on! Love it 😊
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-27 21:46:00	Coutinho was quality today.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-30 09:37:04	@jackcoleman7 aww mate my breakfast nearly came up! Hahaha that is not a sight to see so early. http://t.co/TFeSDZ8tez
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-30 09:44:44	@jackcoleman7 yeah he was beautiful but we had to split as I was getting jealous that he had bigger tits than me haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-29 18:52:31	@jackcoleman7 why you picking up her ham baguette in the first place, you filthy animal haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-29 19:28:10	@jackcoleman7 I got the same image when you first tweeted it hahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-30 13:11:26	The people in Stockport College piss me off, bunch of fucking retards!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-29 19:33:29	@jackcoleman7 I thought the pun was intended haha nobody should ever be allowed to get that fat!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-29 19:41:35	@jackcoleman7 most likely just me, strange sense of humour haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-30 21:01:24	Green Mile ITV4 now, thank me later.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-29 23:42:56	My first dance at my wedding will be to Maxwell - This woman's Work.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-29 23:43:34	Maxwell's version shits all over Kate Bush'
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-27 13:00:00	Wish people wouldn't talk to me when I'm tired!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-01 21:50:33	@jackcoleman7 haha ill never look at a baguette the same way again!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-30 22:15:15	@stuartm27 one of the best I've seen, just extremely long haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-30 22:32:22	@stuartm27 me neither and I have to be up early. I did the same last night when Sleepers was on haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-30 22:41:07	@stuartm27 it was the first time I've seen that one, didnt realise it was so long haha very sad film but brilliant!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-30 22:44:29	@stuartm27 yeah was a very good twist!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-30 23:58:03	@MU689908 hahaha this is hilarious! He's not ok with people telling him to kill himself but its ok for him to punch his girlfriend!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-04-27 23:09:57	Love and Basketball or The Wood 😕
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-01 00:02:32	@MU689908 got charged with assault in 2010 for punching his girlfriend in the face! He's a bit of a prick isn't he.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-01 00:31:22	The ending of Green Mile gets me every time! 😭
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-03 15:01:12	@Zaidiinho its shit how its worked out should have been a trump-o'sullivan final!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-03 15:04:27	@Zaidiinho not right now had to nip out. I've never played snooker but I'm betting I could win a frame too! How did they get this far!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-01 07:09:07	No college for me today, my bed is too nice!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-01 07:10:11	@JessicaRosexo1 I'm not going in college today so not going Lyme park, you weren't going anyway were you? X
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-03 15:28:09	@Zaidiinho terrible players, any idea when trump-ronnie start the second session?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-03 15:32:59	@Zaidiinho aw shit missed it, thought they played after these. Will have to make sure I watch the third. Think I'd like ronnie to win, you?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-03 15:46:25	@Zaidiinho yeah I like trump too, improving all the time with his tactical play. Will be world champion very soon.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-03 15:49:01	@Benno_LUHG PS3? I have problems on that but very rarely have the same problems on Xbox.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-02 14:31:41	Today's weather is definitely driving weather! ☀
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-01 17:44:14	@jackcoleman7 its a barm! Hate the terms roll and muffin. It's a chip barm, bacon barm etc. must be because we're northerners haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 23:55:08	@SourceCentral78 why would he be house hunting when he already has a house here?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 20:27:52	@Benno_LUHG would you rather have Bale or Ronaldo?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 20:30:46	Fed up doesn't even come close to how I'm feeling right now.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 20:34:30	@Benno_LUHG I'm the same, currently I would go for ronaldo every time but the thought that bale may reach them heights for a rival i.e City
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 20:34:49	@Benno_LUHG makes me question whether we should buy him for the future.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 20:39:41	@Benno_LUHG yeah this is why I think SAF will go for Bale. He isn't as good as what Ronaldo was at 23 but definitely improving very quickly.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 20:43:06	@Benno_LUHG yeah I agree, think we'd have to change our play too much to revolve around Ronaldo now. Can't see how all the egos would work..
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 20:43:41	@Benno_LUHG well together now, RvP would surely get pissed off at how selfish Ronaldo is on the ball and can't see Rooney being happy either
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 20:44:36	@Benno_LUHG think I'd go into meltdown if we get both haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 22:13:08	@JoeTaylor84 what a summer that would be if we got a CB, LB, CM and maybe a marquee signing. How much do you reckon we'll spend?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 22:25:29	@JoeTaylor84 I'd be happy with a CM and a marquee signing. Would have a look at Shaw for long term replacement for Evra though.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 22:32:56	@Blakes_1 can't wait to see what he's got in store for us this summer! Would love ronaldo or bale + CM
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 22:36:57	Rather tempted to stay up for the boxing, don't know if i'll last til 4am though #tired
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 22:55:22	@Blakes_1 @JoeTaylor84 he's a brilliant little player, should get him soon or risk losing out on him like we did with Bale!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 23:12:55	@MU689908 Bale looks like he's special in that hugging picture!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 23:22:02	@MU689908 hahaha it does! He should stop embarrassing himself like this, quality player but has no identity bar his stupid ❤celebration!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-04 23:24:46	@MincemeatMUFC stop winding people up! you're gonna have shit loads of people asking you for proof of your sauce haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 10:46:37	@SourceCentral78 exactly so why is he house hunting?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 11:13:02	@Benno_LUHG @ClareA32 I think bale will stay one more season at Spurs. The change in wind comment from SAF seems to point to Ronnie.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 14:18:40	Deserved MOTM for Stevie G.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 14:22:08	@Zaidiinho I actually quite like that midfield, lots of energy to exploit fat franks age and Ramires can't do it on his own.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 14:24:14	@Zaidiinho haha I know you was, I was also questioning why so called fans are moaning. It's not like we can get max pionts now either.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 14:28:18	@Zaidiinho missed the opening 4, watching it now though. How's o'sullivan playing? Didnt expect it to be 2-2.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 14:30:54	@Zaidiinho no I can't either, once Ronnie gets his rhythm going he'll run away with it. Hawkins hasn't got enough in his locker.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 14:33:51	@Zaidiinho just shows how good he actually is, only trained for 2months and he's head and shoulders above the rest.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 14:38:10	@Zaidiinho yeah I expected more from the likes of Robertson and Ding.

Yeah its the only reason I'm watching this, to pass the time haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 14:42:19	@Zaidiinho my little sisters just said exactly the same thing about his waistcoat. She said 'I thought they were supposed to dress smart?'
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 14:50:03	@Zaidiinho just simple like Ronnies would do nicely! Yeah typical he'd up his game, Ronnies just luring him into a false sense of security!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 15:10:36	@Zaidiinho nearly had that century before kick off! I reckon 2-1 united, you?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 17:48:57	A cluttered room leaves a cluttered mind.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 17:57:33	@Zaidiinho i would if i could! bedrooms being decorated and its been a complete mess for the last 2 weeks haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 18:00:38	@Zaidiinho in the room which is why my mind is cluttered haha my dads a decorator so he's doing it around work and in his own time!...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 18:00:54	@Zaidiinho he's luck I haven't killed him😡
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 18:04:48	@Zaidiinho my dads quick to finish jobs when it's someone else but anything in this house takes ages! It's not looking too bad now might...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 18:05:23	@Zaidiinho have it finished by tomorrow but everything's had to come off the walls including the tv so it's all on my bed!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 18:09:34	@Zaidiinho yeah will be glad when its done, he just does the walls and me and my mum sort everything else out the lazy shit haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 18:11:16	@Zaidiinho yeah if you want something done, get a woman to do it haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-07 14:39:31	@corrienationstr you obviously don't understand betting odds, 2/1 means there's less chance than when it was 13/8
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-07 14:42:09	@corrienationstr doesn't work like that, they wouldn't put the odds to 2/1 if they thought it was happening because it means they have to...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-07 14:42:17	@corrienationstr pay out more if it did happen
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-07 14:51:40	@corrienationstr @Double20Red 2/1 are very good odds in betting terms which means its less likely. You get back double what you put on.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 18:15:04	@Zaidiinho yeah right, quick botch job from a man haha 😉
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 21:43:53	@AranSohal if they charge you, don't go. A real psychic will give you their gift for free. I know a couple who won't do readings unless...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-05 21:44:03	@AranSohal it is essential that you get the message.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-06 00:12:20	@JoeTaylor84 may just be me but I'm not really a fan of any Arnie films apart from the odd one.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 09:38:11	@jackcoleman7 I bloody hope so, genuinely devastated! Completely ruined my day.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 09:52:35	@Benno_LUHG I read an article the other day saying only 3 players at RM are talking to Mou. Ramos, Lopez and Coentrão
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 10:04:35	@RuddSam @BusbyMUFC surely Moyes doesn't have to step down, he's out of contract this summer.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 10:11:19	@RuddSam @BusbyMUFC I'm hoping its Mou, don't think Moyes will be able to cut it at Utd.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 10:16:01	@RuddSam @BusbyMUFC I think he might like the challenge of trying to be as successful as SAF. I would assume he wouldn't do his usual 3yr...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 10:16:14	@RuddSam @BusbyMUFC stint but stay a lot longer.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 10:21:42	@RuddSam that'll definitely ease the pain haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 14:59:26	@jackcoleman7 this is where I think it means Mou. A passion for the game and the mentality of a winner.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 15:21:15	@Benno_LUHG do you remember the article that David Moyes wrote last year? He said Ronaldo would be the one player he'd sign from Euro2012
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 15:24:49	@Benno_LUHG i'll back Moyes if he comes in but can't say I won't be a little disappointed and underwhelmed.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 16:04:16	I did call SAF's retirement back on 23rd November when the statue was unveiled. Had a farewell feel about it.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-06 12:30:59	Need some plans, not wasting a day like this!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-07 23:30:35	@Zaidiinho how anyone can think that is a joke. I literally feel sick at the thought of his retirement, stomachs in knots!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-07 23:41:15	@Zaidiinho I'm hoping its something silly. Can't see why he'd want to put a downer on the 20th title before we've even lifted the trophy!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-07 23:46:15	@Zaidiinho I know I always thought Mou would ease SAF retirement but now I'm not even sure that it would!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-07 23:51:24	@Zaidiinho I think Klopp would be a very good replacement. It'll be an anti climax tomorrow that we've signed Strootman haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-07 23:54:52	@Zaidiinho imagine! The bitters would go into meltdown if we were took over by rich owners haha sponsorship would do instead of retirement!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 00:07:11	@Zaidiinho haha would be brilliant, lets hope the announcement is ronaldo resigning instead! 

It's all done now, finished it tonight!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 00:07:43	@JoeTaylor84 I'm the same, my stomachs in knots!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 00:10:54	@JoeTaylor84 I'm trying to come up with any other scenario but his retirement. Hoping its something stupid like a sponsorship.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 18:05:05	@Benno_LUHG @jamiemd31 I think if a player truly wants to play for us, they have to look at prestige of club and not who the manager is.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 18:05:45	@Benno_LUHG @jamiemd31 SAF will still have a lot to say in who we sign and he'll still have pulling power.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-07 14:51:06	@corrienationstr @Double20Red 1/10 are shit odds though which meant he was more likely to sign. Every £10 you put on you get a pound back...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 22:17:50	Can't cope with all these tributes and montages!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-10 17:54:32	I would give an arm and a leg to go to the United game on Sunday!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-10 17:58:12	@ClareA32 I'm looking for tickets too, if I see any about i'll let you know, I've emailed a few ads that I've seen for £100.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-10 18:00:40	@MincemeatMUFC it was actually 'fuck you' Foda se or something he said at the bench when he scored.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-10 18:14:14	@Benno_LUHG he didn't hurl abuse but did aim Foda Se at the bench which means fuck you.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-10 18:34:40	@ClareA32 I know I've seen some for £600 but refuse to pay that amount, can't understand fellow fans charging that amount!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-10 19:18:45	@Creje7 I'm the same, feel like I'm in a state of mourning. It's not even that I'm worried about Moyes, I'm just gonna miss SAF.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-10 19:22:06	@Creje7 indeed it is, can't help but feel it wasn't the right time for him to go. My last time was Southampton so was gutted I couldn't...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-10 19:22:14	@Creje7 get tickets for Sunday.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-10 19:25:49	@Creje7 that's understandable, don't think I'd be able to handle the emotions anyway if I did go. There will definitely be some tears at OT
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-10 20:12:31	@ClareA32 exactly, if they don't care about seeing his last home game they should want to let someone else go.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-10 20:13:19	@BusbyMUFC you can't download can you? Just listen to it.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-09 13:16:53	@Benno_LUHG apparently sky sports twitter was hacked yesterday aswell which said that Mourinho was the new united manager.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-10 23:37:45	@JoeTaylor84 plus he's a dirty bastard who would get sent off or suspended every other week for headbutting/elbowing someone!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-09 15:59:00	@BusbyMUFC maybe its true he was never a candidate and he's a bit fucked off.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 08:31:52	Absolutely gutted
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-08 08:51:14	@FootballMcD surely these David Moyes rumours can't be true?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-11 16:18:32	@ClareA32 this is the site I've been looking on, there's a pair for £140! I've emailed him but had no reply. Maybe you could try too?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-11 19:09:08	@jackcoleman7 the impersonator? I found it very hard to watch him!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-11 19:12:35	@jackcoleman7 mine too, he was pretty much a male Stacey Soloman. Unbearable personality.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-12 08:40:39	Why's Bob Cass got glitter all over his face haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-15 08:57:01	Waking up late and having to rush round is not good!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-13 20:59:54	The parade was absolute madness, brilliant turnout!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-12 17:23:45	The end of an era today, definitely a lump in throat moment.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-12 17:49:34	@GreatnessMUFC SAF has just said he has asked for a transfer
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-12 18:08:27	@mufcvoice do you hate Ronaldo as much as you hate Rooney? Same situations.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-13 21:36:23	What an atmosphere there was at the parade! @WayneRooney would have to be an absolute mad man to want to leave after today.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-13 21:40:03	City couldn't have picked a better day to sack Mancini, you'd think they were trying to make United fans' day even better!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-16 18:54:42	Vodafone has got to be the worst network I've ever been on!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-14 11:35:58	@Benno_LUHG he also agreed he was treated as a slave and said he did us a favour by staying longer
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-14 16:52:30	@Blakes_1 apparently they take £3 of every £10 donated even if we don't sign him! What a scam they've got going hahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-17 17:07:07	It makes me sad when I see men with skinnier legs than me
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-14 17:09:44	@MrScripto what a scam they've got going, basically the pledge will have nothing to do with whether we sign him or not and...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-14 17:09:57	@MrScripto if we do sign him they'll be over the moon with but will have also made a hefty profit from stupid fans who believe it was down..
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-14 17:10:14	@MrScripto to them and if we don't sign him they still make a profit!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-14 17:35:10	@Blakes_1 can't believe nearly 4,000 people have fell for it haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-17 22:10:37	@Stubbs89 do you not believe that David guy then? I find it hard to think Ronnie would go CFC but I've not seen david get anything wrong.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-17 22:19:24	@Stubbs89 that guy on here that's claiming he knows where Ronaldo's going. Don't know why I'm using his first name like I know him haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-17 22:25:22	@Stubbs89 my problem with it is, he was certain about RvP and put 4k on it but only put 450 on this. Can't see how he would even be in...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-17 22:25:37	@Stubbs89 the vicinity if ronaldo to hear him say he was going Chelsea!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-18 00:03:52	@ljmascarenhas @ManutdRedCafe it was only last week though that papers we're reporting a bust up between Mou and Ronaldo
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-13 14:21:13	Who's going to the parade?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-18 16:38:25	@shazia_dar me and my sisters inherited it from my mum haha I can't even sit in the room with someone when they are eating!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-18 16:56:29	@shazia_dar cinema is a pain, we always wait about 2 weeks after its released because there's less people haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-19 09:52:37	@jackcoleman7 horrible player
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-17 23:18:23	@ManutdRedCafe what do you make of Ronaldo to Chelsea?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-17 23:34:14	@FootballMcD do you believe the rumours of him taking Ronaldo there with him? Quite plausible I think.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-19 23:47:52	@sillwuka I don't know which bit is funniest, the domination bit or the fact they think they can buy Ronaldo!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-19 23:59:50	@sillwuka I thought it was a joke, I had to check if it was a parody account! Everton are definitely the best team in Merseyside!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-20 00:01:09	Walk the Line has got to be one of the best biographical films ever made.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-18 16:24:03	@shazia_dar I'm the exact same, I've self diagnosed myself with Misophonia haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-20 10:18:20	How can this woman genuinely believe she's too pretty to work? #ThisMorning
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-20 10:19:40	@Zaidiinho to be fair though lindegaard is considerably less talented to DDG and I don't think he's even 2nd keeper quality for Utd.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-20 10:33:20	@Zaidiinho yeah he's capable of more but I think a lot of his displays/mistakes have been overseen due to DDG being criticised a lot.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-20 10:52:11	I love minding this child but what a strange child she is! House full of toys and she wants to sit in a drawer! http://t.co/3uYNJNNVFX
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-22 09:30:21	Waking up late and missing your first lesson is not cool!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-22 09:49:05	@JessicaRosexo1 will you tell Andy I'm on my way please :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-22 18:56:46	@BusbyMUFC he said that he swears by almighty Allah he will not stop fighting them.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-22 19:01:20	@TheLeverettRant Thiago can play CM too though, played quite a bit as a deep lying creative mid under Pep.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-22 19:06:19	@TheLeverettRant if we're transitioning to this 4231 you need 2 CM that sit deeper though. He's been named the new xavi by Barca themselves
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-18 21:18:40	@Zaidiinho I refuse to watch it, shortest programme to grace the tv haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-18 21:22:15	@Zaidiinho haha stupid iPhone correcting everything! Last time I watched it was about 10 years ago!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-18 21:31:21	@Zaidiinho waiting for celeb juice haha absolutely sod all on for a Saturday night! You?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-22 21:34:55	Bigoted views everywhere, the men that killed that soldier were religion extremists not 'Muslims'. Every religion has bad representatives!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-22 21:38:29	@kiranh0405 I'm coming with you! Sick to death of bigots and uneducated people.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-22 21:44:23	@kiranh0405 does this place exist? Haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-22 21:48:20	@kiranh0405 we can just rid this country of idiots and tie a rope to the sun so that we'll always be in sunshine, that's gotta be easier?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-22 22:06:08	@kiranh0405 I'm lazy too, I'll google it, see if there's a place like this that exists haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-22 22:09:26	@FootballMcD the rule at RM is you extend or go when the contract is at 2yrs. Could easily force their hand to go wherever he wants.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-18 21:50:28	@Zaidiinho I'm looking for a good film but doesn't seem to be many about at the minute, what sort do you watch?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-18 21:53:09	@Zaidiinho ill watch anything but horror, I have nightmares for weeks haha have you ever seen The Game with Michael Douglas?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-18 22:05:44	@Zaidiinho 97 I think, one of the best films I've seen just messes with my head haha the prestige is another that messes with my head!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-18 22:12:06	@Zaidiinho I think I've seen bits of the illusionist but not the whole way through, might give it a watch.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-18 22:21:01	@Zaidiinho mines shit too, men fawning over David Beckham and discussing Eurovision haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-18 22:29:43	@Zaidiinho we can all look forward to transfer muppet season aswell this summer haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-23 18:30:37	@JessicaRosexo1 yeah :) what time you thinking?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-23 18:33:18	@JessicaRosexo1 yeah no problem, just let me know when you're on your way to college and I'll set off :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-21 17:19:59	@Zaidiinho Playstations aren't all that, get disconnected all the time!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-21 17:21:14	@Zaidiinho online gaming, I can never get a full game on FIFA on PS! Can't even blame the EA servers either because it never happens on xbox
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-21 17:45:22	@Zaidiinho oh god not a PES fan are you?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-21 17:49:35	@Zaidiinho tbf I've not played PES for a good 8 years but I just feel like I should carry on the trend of only allowed to like one haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-21 17:52:03	@Zaidiinho I have heard that the gameplay of PES is much better than FIFA so might give it a go on the next one :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-21 17:54:12	My old high school is dumb! Fancy giving a bunch of kids an iPad!

 http://t.co/iiFg0ZQMsv
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-21 17:56:28	@Zaidiinho will do as soon as I get it :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-24 10:01:55	@JessicaRosexo1 haha I'm absolutely shattered anyway!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-25 20:23:47	@jackcoleman7 do you have any idea what time Froch is scheduled to fight?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-25 20:33:34	@jackcoleman7 thank you :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-25 21:19:58	@JoeTaylor84 Subotic is the better of the two Dortmund CB's
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-25 21:27:58	@JoeTaylor84 yeah think Hummels is very similar to Luiz, always looking to play the ball out and looking for the long ball over the top.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-25 22:18:51	Come on Froch!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-25 23:26:25	Get in @Carl_Froch fully deserved. What a fight!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-25 23:33:31	That was definitely the best fight I've seen in years!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-22 15:40:16	@JoeTaylor84 yeah and they can send Veratti our way haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-22 18:58:56	@TheLeverettRant he's quite well clued up when it comes to Barca, works quite closely with them and wrote that book on them.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-22 19:10:25	@TheLeverettRant I don't think we've ever truly played 4231, we love wingers too much! The 3 should be AM rather than a SS and 2 wingers.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-24 19:40:58	@Creje7 tbf though it wasn't Fellaini's choice to be played up there, he sees himself as a 6 or an 8 but Everton lacked power up front.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-24 19:43:49	Has anyone seen The Great Gatsby and  do they recommend it?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-24 19:53:53	@Creje7 no I totally agree he's not United quality and I'd rather us buy someone else. He's quite a dirty player too which I don't like.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-27 19:35:23	The only genuinely talented person I've seen on BGT all night. Amazing voice for an 11 year old.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-26 20:12:37	My dinner &gt; Your dinner http://t.co/MVZ1k9UYpH
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-26 20:33:42	I have the worst ear infection ever 😞
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-26 21:24:02	Think I might go for a drive and play out for a bit.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-27 18:37:46	I genuinely wonder what goes through people's mind when they decide to dance with a puppet on national TV #BGT
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-27 19:26:07	@jackcoleman7 you're favourite person ever is on now hahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-27 19:29:15	@jackcoleman7 he's done pretty much the same people again, cringe isn't the word!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-28 19:34:54	Her hand movements are a mixture between Diana Vickers and Amy Whinehouse. Stop waving your hands and pulling at your dress! #BGT
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-28 19:37:59	Hate all this crying whilst looking at the ground shit, can see straight through these fronts that people put on.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-25 12:51:14	It's too nice of a day to not have any plans!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-30 08:03:34	@ClareA32 @Creje7 Cesc has only just turned 26 and if Thiago is going to be as good as they think, think Barca would rather sell Cesc.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-30 08:04:42	@mufcvoice neither Cesc nor Thiago play the same position as Kagawa, so won't be a problem.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-30 08:10:58	@Creje7 @ClareA32 he has a €30m clause apparently, so wages would be the only thing that we could be outbid on.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-30 08:29:02	@Creje7 I think this summer is the only summer for a while that we could sign a big player to ease Moyes in. Won't hold my breath though...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-30 08:29:08	@Creje7 RvP was offered the same wage as we did by City, he just opted for us. Doubt Cesc would want to leave Barca
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-30 08:43:15	@ClareA32 @Creje7 yeah I can't see arsenal matching any offer for that amount of money and Cesc wants to win things, won't do that at AFC
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-30 09:36:47	@mufcvoice no they're not. Cesc is better at CM which is why he's struggling at Barca and Thiago is better when playing deeper. None are #10
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-30 20:39:55	@MU689908 hahahaha I've not laughed that much in ages! Who chooses to be ginger!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-30 20:52:14	@MU689908 I'm crying laughing! Does he say at one point 'I just wanna leave this settee'? 😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-30 22:47:29	@kiranh0405 bloody hell, how big is your bath haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-30 22:50:24	@kiranh0405 well I was going to ask that but didnt want to be insensitive about your stunted growth haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-30 22:51:09	@kiranh0405 bath bombs make me go under the water all the time, they make it slippy!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-31 18:45:04	@TheLeverettRant think if Fab left FCB there'd be no way back again, fans dislike him already. Thiago isn't Catalan so doesn't have same...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-31 18:45:41	@TheLeverettRant ties to FCB, his dad said he's more interested in succeeding in general than succeeding at Barca.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-05-31 19:05:34	What the fucking hell was that? #BGT
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-01 19:14:43	I love everything about him, even though he looks about 12 #BGT
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-01 19:28:38	Attraction are my favourite act by far! #BGT
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-02 17:35:36	@JessicaRosexo1 have you done M3 for Andy? I've left everything til last minute again haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-02 17:41:37	@JessicaRosexo1 I've done fuck all this week! I remember Andy waffling about M3 but still haven't got a clue where to start haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-02 17:46:25	@JessicaRosexo1 me too! Andy wants all merits in this week so gonna have to get them done and then distinctions the week after!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-02 17:49:53	@JessicaRosexo1 haha I kept thinking I'll do it tomorrow and now its Sunday! We'll just have to make a pact again!

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-03 22:59:55	@michael_oram01 12th August, are you going back?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-03 23:08:35	@michael_oram01 year off from partying in bar street with random Turks haha you not going away at all then?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-03 23:12:04	@michael_oram01 why don't you then? You could do a day trip round Malta, its that small haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-05 08:46:14	@JessicaRosexo1 I'm running late again! Won't be in til about half 10 haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-05 08:54:30	@JessicaRosexo1 I know, I'm just useless haha thank you x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-03 23:18:53	@michael_oram01 my parents are going Meridyen too, seems everyone loves that place. How's the acting going?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-03 23:23:20	@michael_oram01 had no idea you'd made a new account. What's your new production? invite my dad round to be PC King haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-03 23:27:06	@michael_oram01 will do. Haha he makes sure that we and everybody else remembers. Night :) x

http://t.co/u7G4fODf6E
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-03 23:57:41	@Kate2373 @JACopeland85 @tancredipalmeri people assuming its his house but they all look the same in that area. Hope it is though.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-04 07:54:31	@JessicaRosexo1 yeah I decided to have an extra half an hour sleep, not even ready myself! Will prob be in about the same time x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-04 20:54:52	@ClareA32 people were discussing this last night, its not new it was apparently in it a while ago.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-04 22:32:34	@JoeTaylor84 yeah seems like they're just trying to keep the story going due to nothing else being interesting enough to write about.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-04 22:45:17	@JoeTaylor84 Its all bullshit until proven to be correct. Though I do tend to get sucked in by Ronaldo rumours occasionally haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-04 22:52:48	@Zaidiinho absolutely nothing!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-04 22:56:00	@Zaidiinho yep, re-using quotes from ages ago about him wanting to be a striker and not a midfielder just yet.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-04 22:56:27	@JoeTaylor84 I wish I wasn't, I'm left disappointed every bloody summer haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-04 23:01:45	@Zaidiinho think people assume his ability for long passing instantly makes him a midfielder, can't see it myself!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-04 23:10:19	@Zaidiinho I agree. Think the fact he hasn't been great recently, people are trying to fit him in a position where they 'think' he may shine
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-08 19:02:43	I'd slap my sister if she went out in public looking like that #BGT
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-08 19:25:53	@JoeTaylor84 not a problem, for what it's worth I think it a big ploy for a massive contract off RM. http://t.co/hG2N77k8C9
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-08 19:29:25	@JoeTaylor84 yeah doubt we'd spend that on him but could all depend on whether RM buy Bale, if they do I think he'll consider leaving.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-08 19:45:04	That has made my night! #BGT
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-03 15:22:26	@JessicaRosexo1 not sure you know probably normal time so I can get Maria's work done, you? x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-05 22:27:08	@MU689908 he looks like the love child of RvP and Cech haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-05 22:35:44	@MU689908 @JK__92 come off it, RvP from appearance doesn't look the brightest does he haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-03 17:28:11	@NapzMusic "Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none"
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-04 22:12:39	@ClareA32 yeah I read somewhere about £75m deal with Nike which was conditional on cristiano signing. Also couldn't be announced til after..
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-04 22:12:58	@ClareA32 Real Madrid re-elections. We'll see I suppose.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-04 22:29:21	@JoeTaylor84 wouldn't mind but weren't them quotes about midfield from ages ago?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-09 02:19:33	Sleeping in this heat is impossible!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-06 09:06:08	@JessicaRosexo1 waiting for the bloody lift haha x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-09 14:20:52	Shaun Maloney to Everton, get your money on it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-09 21:20:43	@shazia_dar could be repetitive strain!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-09 21:44:40	@shazia_dar yeah do, if it persists. I am enjoying it but slightly burnt! One thing I inherited from my Irish family was pale skin haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-09 22:15:42	@shazia_dar yeah you too! Erm just going on holiday to Turkey, how about you?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-09 23:47:49	@TwentyMUFC 'years back' is a slight exaggeration, that was from last summer haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-07 13:42:32	@JessicaRosexo1 try not to sprinkle it on your curry!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-08 16:39:12	@MrScripto it's all good and well having the full team out, but makes no difference if they're not played in their correct positions.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-08 18:49:44	@JoeTaylor84 he apparently denied saying this, said he's not even had talks with Madrid about a new contract.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-08 18:52:09	@JoeTaylor84 they were quotes from The Guardian this morning, but has since come out and said that he hasn't held talks since Mourinho left.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-08 18:56:02	@JoeTaylor84 yeah thinks it from this http://t.co/uQBAXzCNWc but has now apparently said he doesn't know if he'll stay.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-12 07:43:56	@BusbyMUFC No CL football should stop him opting for them straight away.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-10 19:16:05	@JessicaRosexo1 are you still going in tomorrow? x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-10 20:33:09	@JessicaRosexo1 I'm not sure, maybe 10/11. Only got 2 things to do and then work skills x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-10 20:39:35	@JessicaRosexo1 yeah 1's ok I just thought you had more work to do, didn't want to go too early incase we were sat round for ages! x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-13 20:15:42	For a model, she has no idea of how to pose. #bigbrother
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-13 21:01:25	@jackcoleman7 cracking representation for us haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-15 12:33:25	@ClareA32 that's because they know everyone is ringing up to change to BT haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-15 12:56:46	@ClareA32 yeah that's a decent amount that they've knocked off, think they'll be losing a lot of customers over the next month or so.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-10 21:34:39	I absolutely love Coyote Ugly!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-13 23:38:09	@CheGiaevara the only thing I've seen rumoured regarding sponsors was that our new deal with Nike would have a conditional on the signing...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-13 23:38:28	@CheGiaevara of Ronaldo and we would be given X amount extra for every year he is at United, don't know how true it is though.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-13 23:46:54	@CheGiaevara yeah he would generate obscene amounts of money at United. Is this a way of getting around 3rd party ownership, FFP issues etc?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-13 23:55:25	@CheGiaevara I think it would be too risky to have a sponsor directly fund a transfer even if by donation. Surely all other clubs would be
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-13 23:55:41	@CheGiaevara outraged at the fact we have sponsors paying for big transfers meaning there would be investigations.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-13 23:55:46	@CheGiaevara Think we should stick to Chevy helping with wages and Nike just offering a higher % from revenue to sort of get around it.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-14 00:04:42	@CheGiaevara I agree the only way I'd happily see Ronaldo here is if we strengthen midfield too. Don't want another year with only one
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-14 00:05:09	@CheGiaevara class midfielder. Carrick isn't getting any younger and I just don't think the others are good enough.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-11 11:39:55	@JessicaRosexo1 yeah just having something to eat then I'll set off x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-11 16:48:32	Why have I got random people favouriting tweets from 22 days ago #weirdos
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-13 15:19:04	@deanustp Ex-President, Calderon, said Real have a rule where you either extend or leave when your contract gets to 2 years.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-13 15:28:40	@deanustp yeah me neither til the other day, maybe they'd make an exception for Ronaldo though with him being so good.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-15 21:58:26	@JoeTaylor84 this is hilarious, good on you for setting the little slag straight!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-15 22:06:00	@JoeTaylor84 yeah she could be, your wife is on here aswell isn't she? If it isn't a catfish then its just pure cheek haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-15 22:09:11	@JoeTaylor84 oh i see. At least she'll have something to have a good laugh at when she gets in from work!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-15 22:13:29	@JoeTaylor84 I'm sure she will when she sees what you said to her haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-17 17:44:47	@jackcoleman7 @calumtierney well according to Richard Arnold you should be putting your house on it haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-17 18:06:25	@jackcoleman7 @calumtierney put your house on him coming back this summer. Could have been a wind up but he was pretty adamant about it.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-17 18:20:52	@jackcoleman7 @calumtierney I actually think there'll be a few shocked fans this summer regarding this. @Utd9908 is the guy who said it.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-18 14:11:29	@AmyCorrigan24 are you going work skills?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-18 14:20:29	@AmyCorrigan24 no I haven't got it but ill ask when I see her x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-18 20:10:50	@NapzMusic you'll end up with teeth like this guy hahaha http://t.co/cXg70HObBM
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-18 20:22:58	@NapzMusic hahaha honestly it's not a good look!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-18 23:23:42	@JoeTaylor84 did you see the quotes front he Spanish journalist on MarcaTV?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-17 15:16:28	@JessicaRosexo1 yeah just gonna go in for work skills at 3:30 x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-17 18:04:35	@jackcoleman7 @calumtierney hahaha the gay guy from GMTV! No some guy on here yesterday was saying he was at a charity event and...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-17 18:05:12	@jackcoleman7 @calumtierney Richard Arnold was there, who is Uniteds commercial executive director. He said he's also a friend of his...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-17 18:05:59	@jackcoleman7 @calumtierney uncle. He said he was asked 3 times at the event if Ronaldo was coming back and each time he said...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-20 08:59:42	@JessicaRosexo1 me too, had like 3 hours sleep but already in college so that I can get home asap.x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-20 09:43:33	@JessicaRosexo1 Maria said its important to be in because we have to correct any work and put it in our portfolio and enrol on the 2nd year.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-20 09:48:30	@JessicaRosexo1 I would think so, you may be here a while though.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-20 12:59:44	@JessicaRosexo1 I got a slender tone belt to do it for me because I cba doing them haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-17 21:00:17	@jackcoleman7 @calumtierney @Utd9908  the gay guy from GMTV
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-18 12:39:32	@JessicaRosexo1 yeah no problem x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-18 16:45:44	@jackcoleman7 don't worry, Big Dave will be whispering sweet nothing's in his ear about United haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-18 23:26:44	@JoeTaylor84 Sod it, my hopes are up! Can't believe we may actually be signing a potentially world class CM haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-19 12:48:45	@BusbyMUFC have you seen the video of Wayne Rooney with his collar up!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-19 12:56:23	@BusbyMUFC I'll have a look now, he looks a complete nob haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-19 12:57:45	@BusbyMUFC http://t.co/Xom2HHE2Xs here it is
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-19 13:44:58	@jackcoleman7 if your on about the person I think you are, his Jekyll and Hyde persona is pretty tedious.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-19 13:52:33	@jackcoleman7 haha we're gonna have another Fred West on our hands, only he'll be burying all his friends in his garden!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-20 02:25:53	Being nocturnal is not good when you have to be up in 4 hours!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-20 23:38:35	@MU689908 Every time you post a tweet with a pic I fall for it, I think 'it won't be Scholes' nob again!' Hahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-19 18:40:52	@JessicaRosexo1 we have to go in tomorrow to sort our work out!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-19 18:45:09	@JessicaRosexo1 yeah when I went in the other day, Maria said group B is Thursday and the earlier the better for us!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-19 18:48:40	@JessicaRosexo1 probably 10, just want to get it all sorted so I don't have to go back in apart from next Tuesday.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-22 13:29:05	@DelMUFC it was a rumour that was took out of context. Carrick was talking about Rugby wingers and people assumed it was to do with united.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-24 18:28:28	En route to MEN for Kings of Leon!!😝🎵
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-24 23:07:24	Kings of Leon were AMAZING!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-25 12:44:06	@JessicaRosexo1 yeah probably be in for 3ish x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-25 18:14:12	If I win £157m tonight, I know what I'm doing... Fucking off from this place #EuroMillions
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-26 02:11:07	No matter how tired I am, sleep is a myth!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-27 20:57:29	@JoeTaylor84 have you seen what that David Johnson guy has been saying recently re Ronaldo?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-27 20:59:20	@JoeTaylor84 he's insinuating he put money on him there because he knew everyone else would and then lumped on United when odds widened.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-27 21:02:46	@JoeTaylor84 yeah I think he genuinely put money on him there but did it to convince others to! He said that tweet about CFC has made...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-27 21:02:53	@JoeTaylor84 him a lot of money! Also said that Ronnie is meeting united officials today.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-27 21:07:20	@JoeTaylor84 yeah I read that in the El Pais article. If he's telling the truth about betting on CFC to get others to, then there's going...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-27 21:07:28	@JoeTaylor84 to be a few angry followers as I seen a few people showing betting slips of £300!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-27 21:09:29	@JoeTaylor84 I know yeah never in a million years would I risk that amount based on someone's word!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-27 21:15:32	@JoeTaylor84 my thought exactly when he said 'how can you book him when he's made a run like that'
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-06-27 21:19:31	@JoeTaylor84 haha err maybe because he's just deliberately stuck his hand on the end of the ball!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-02 21:09:29	Not gonna lie, jumped a few times and covered my eyes for the new episode of Luther!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-02 22:51:52	@Benno_LUHG bloods and that are still done at Bridgewater so I would assume someone would have got wind of a medical by now.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-02 23:27:16	@Benno_LUHG I do think we'll hear some sort of confirmation this week, but think medical will prob be next week
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-03 00:34:21	@MUFC0FFICIAL almost everyone knows who started the Ronaldo to CFC rumours. He told everyone the other day on here! Hardly a secret.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-04 12:25:10	@notjhonsmith @corrienationstr he's not a left back he's an AM, can play anywhere behind striker.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-04 23:01:22	@Zaidiinho This tweet is going to make women look stupid! They will argue they aren't less intelligent without figuring out your statistic..
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-04 23:01:47	@Zaidiinho is made up! You are such a wind up merchant Ali haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-04 23:09:42	@Zaidiinho yeah I bet you don't! Haha how many women have took the bait so far?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-04 23:18:57	@Zaidiinho I would say the women were stupid for accepting that. There are just as many intelligent women as there are men.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-04 23:21:48	@Zaidiinho Men tend to excel a lot later in life, after they've grown up haha I'm good thanks, you?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-04 23:25:17	@Zaidiinho that's true, it's a known fact girls from 11+ exceed boys academically for a VERY long period of time haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-04 23:29:28	@Zaidiinho yeah it's not intelligence, it's just girls are much more disciplined which is why most get better exam results.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-04 23:31:29	@Zaidiinho nah I was never girly enough to make pretty notes. Revised half an hour before exams and still did pretty well haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-04 23:35:08	@Zaidiinho maths &amp; science were my best subjects too, maybe 'cause the answers are black+white rather than English where nothing is 'wrong'
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-04 23:37:28	@Zaidiinho I was good at art but I spent too much time looking for the right answer haha foreign languages were good for me, too.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-04 23:39:46	@Zaidiinho I did Italian, hopefully going in RAF next year for languages! I was too haha we were both just good at everything weren't we😆
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-04 23:42:44	@Zaidiinho I'm applying for Weapon System Operator/Linguist. Blowing your own trumpet I see haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-05 07:39:58	@TayaSophie supposed to be getting a heat wave for the next 4 weeks so you might be alright haha x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-05 16:29:42	@sardinetrawler is it true these quotes were actually said by someone called Jorge Manuel Mendes &amp; was just pretending to be JM on radio?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-05 16:31:58	@sardinetrawler its just this article has been posted since 
http://t.co/uE8Y1aZigG 

but can only make out bits of it from google translate
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-05 16:35:48	@sardinetrawler yeah I understand, thanks anyway.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-05 16:36:41	@sardinetrawler I think everyone may well have been duped if its true haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 13:05:01	Robsons serve needs some serious work #Wimbledon
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 13:09:37	@BusbyMUFC if that's the case though shouldn't women be paid the same amount for football then since we play the same amount of time?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 13:19:29	@BusbyMUFC but have you ever questioned why the popularity and financial strength isn't the same? We don't get the same commitment or help
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 13:19:55	@BusbyMUFC within the sport because its pretty much know most men don't like watching women being able to do something equal to men.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 13:20:29	@BusbyMUFC For example, we tried to promote netball to televise the sport. Our reply to that was unless the women are...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 13:20:41	@BusbyMUFC willing to where revealing clothes than it won't happen because men
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 13:20:45	@BusbyMUFC won't watch a women better them at a sport unless there's a benefit like them being half naked.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 13:35:12	@BusbyMUFC yeah I understand where you're coming from, I'm just saying if people feel we should be paid less in tennis
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 13:35:27	@BusbyMUFC because we play less then surely we should be paid the same in football. I'm the first to say i prefer to watch men
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 13:35:37	@BusbyMUFC because the standard is higher but that's the associations fault for not putting the same effort into womens sport.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 13:35:41	@BusbyMUFC Personally if I was a tennis player I would want to go 5 sets, my for money but to prove I can do the same as men.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-07 20:30:08	Were Jack and Joe actually triplets, with the third being Mr. Tumble? @bbuk
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 20:45:15	@Zaidiinho weren't the 2 we lost by 1 point and goal difference aswell?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 20:51:23	@Zaidiinho yeah just checked was 09/10 CFC had 86 we had 85 and 11/12 was GD to City. For an 'average team...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 20:51:43	@Zaidiinho with a world class manager' we've managed to carry on with our success pretty well I'd say!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 20:54:50	@Zaidiinho wasn't that the game with the ridiculously offside goal that they scored? 5/7 isn't bad at all!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 20:57:38	@Zaidiinho yeah that's the one, always remember it because of how shit we played. We had to let someone win a title though, can't be greedy😉
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 21:01:50	@Zaidiinho I actually think the European Cup will come within the next 3 seasons, my bet would be not this season but next season.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 21:06:25	@Zaidiinho the only doubt I would have this season is Moyes lack of experience, the season after is definitely a possibility!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 21:09:43	@Zaidiinho that's true, I'm being picky now but I would prefer to win it in better style than they did.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 21:12:01	@Zaidiinho yeah any win is better than a loss. It'd be much sweeter if we managed to win it and play good football without being fucked over
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 21:19:22	@Zaidiinho Thiago, Baines and Ronaldo would be brilliant! I would keep Rooney if he knuckles down just simply because
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 21:19:33	@Zaidiinho he would improve every team he went to which would could potentially hurt us
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 21:23:45	@Zaidiinho Haha think a CM and Ronaldo would set us up for a treble chance. Rooney isn't the player he used to be but still integral for us.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 21:31:52	@Zaidiinho yeah 50goals a season would defo help us haha yeah he's still got it just needs to have a good pre season injury and fat free!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 21:38:37	@Zaidiinho yeah especially when your career is based on fitness, its pretty basic to be fair haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-01 21:41:15	@Zaidiinho I know hardly is if they have to fit it around a 9-5! Wish I could lounge about and go gym when I want!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-08 17:07:07	I just don't get along with 99% of females.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-08 23:38:38	Can't cope with my cat bringing in frogs at this time!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-11 16:31:31	@ClareA32 as far as I've read it wasn't as straight forward as that. He was just discussing the flexibility of the squad and said Martinez..
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-11 16:31:43	@ClareA32 could play CB if he needed him to.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-16 11:31:22	@dannyh9623 he'd have to want to go back to Arsenal for the clause to be in place, which I doubt considering they aren't competitive atm
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-20 18:31:01	@JoeTaylor84 I don't believe he has half the inside knowledge he suggests he does. Was it 'Villa close to THFC' that he said a while ago?...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-20 18:31:37	@JoeTaylor84 also how could e not know where Thiago was off if he is as close to Mazinho as he said he was and was a neighbour.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-20 19:04:36	@hezy_1 the funny thing is we bid yesterday before he resigned. It was just leaked today.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-18 17:11:11	@Zaidiinho apparently missed more clear cut chances than any other player in La Liga, along with Navas who had 80 shots and didn't score 1!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-18 17:14:27	@Zaidiinho my bad its worse, missed more chances than any player in the top 5 European leagues hahahaha

Navas has apparently got over...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 17:54:13	@Zaidiinho saw that you were asking about films to watch before. Have you seen Side Effects?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 18:01:45	@Zaidiinho should be able to, I watched a BR Rip from a website called alluc on my PS3. Decent film aswell.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 18:08:18	@Zaidiinho yeah, I only watched it yesterday but enjoyed it. Then again i'll watch near enough any film haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 18:58:29	@Zaidiinho yeah I'm the same although sounds stupid I'm not keen on comedies unless it has a decent story line. Cant stand Spoof films!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 19:20:57	@Zaidiinho I've not watched many films this year &amp; the ones I have seen haven't impressed to much. Keep meaning to watch Olympus has fallen&amp;
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 19:21:11	@Zaidiinho a place beyond the pines, have you seen any of them?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 19:25:17	@Zaidiinho I've seen the first 30mins of Olympus and seems good. 2nd one is Eva Mendes and Ryan Gosling. Both should be downloadable.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 19:28:37	@Zaidiinho i bet you do haha yeah I might give it a watch later on. Apparently a very good film but I don't think I've seen one bad film...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 19:28:49	@Zaidiinho by either of those actors yet.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 19:30:47	@Zaidiinho yeah thought it was a bit of a weird film. Not what I expected. Blue Valentine was a strange film too.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 19:39:09	@Zaidiinho Gosling looked awful in it, which is probably why I was put off haha. Probably watch big brother and then a film. Not in work...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 19:39:26	@Zaidiinho til Wednesday so can have a late night haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 19:48:13	@Zaidiinho I will indeed. You got work in the morning or are you pushing the boat out with a late night too haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 19:52:47	@Zaidiinho what do you work as?

Yeah it is quite dark, has a good twist in it though. I originally opted for it because of the lead males 😆
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 20:04:04	@Zaidiinho check you out.

I've heard a few people say Rooney Mara is attractive, think she's pretty but obviously I don't see her that way.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-18 17:14:56	@Zaidiinho his homesickness but still think it'll take him a while to settle in. The 80 shots things is true though hahaha!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-18 17:16:59	@Zaidiinho yeah think Navas was just bought to supply width, but negredo smacks of a panic buy to me. No better than what they've got.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-18 17:27:08	@Zaidiinho think he will go city. I've not seen huge amounts of him but what I have seen is he pretty good. Similar to Aguero only Aguero...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-18 17:27:21	@Zaidiinho only Aguero is currently better than him
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-18 17:29:57	@Zaidiinho yeah think his injuries hampered him. Jovetic will prob be there best buy this season if they don't sign anyone else.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-18 17:32:05	@Zaidiinho I'm not really worried either, they have massively improved. If we sign a CM and bale/ronaldo we'll walk the league again.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-18 17:34:22	@Zaidiinho True, just think to go far in Europe aswell we'll need an improved CM. we need to be able to supply the likes of bale/ronaldo.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 21:56:19	@Zaidiinho I did too but she did deserve it tbf for killing Channing Tatum haha did you like it?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-21 22:03:19	@Zaidiinho I thought it was slightly strange that Catherine Zeta-Jones got that role haha I'm putting a place beyond the pines on in a min ☺
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-22 10:50:20	@Zaidiinho what did you think of the film?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-22 10:55:35	@Zaidiinho yeah I wouldnt say it was great either, I think they cut the bank robbing part too short. Shouldn't have killed him I don't think
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-22 11:07:04	@Zaidiinho yeah think it would have been better had they just went with the bank robbing storyline. Think I'll watch Olympus has fallen
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-22 12:55:41	@Zaidiinho Obviously! Eva looked rough towards the end of the film haha yeah the corruption was solved pretty quickly!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-20 13:17:07	Saturdays shouldn't be allowed to be this boring!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-20 17:35:18	@JoeTaylor84 it wouldn't surprise me if Hunter was being lead on a merry dance, the amount of shit he's come out with recently.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-22 20:06:54	Why is Prince Harry known as Harry when his names Henry? So confused!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-22 21:44:33	@AranSohal hire females to do transfer work, good looking females preferably. Must make negotiations much easier for footballers haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-22 21:57:48	@AranSohal haha from a MUFC fans point of view I'd love it if we had a female negotiator, we may have more chance of landing targets haha...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-22 21:59:01	@AranSohal a female Daniel Levy would be much much worse hahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-22 23:01:15	@Zaidiinho @JoeTaylor84 let me know too Ali, not had the time to put it on tonight!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-23 00:12:13	@Zaidiinho @JoeTaylor84 I sensed that from the 30mins I've seen of it. Will prob watch it one night when there's nothing else on haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-23 00:36:45	@Zaidiinho something to look forward to then haha I haven't got a clue at the min will have to scroll through tinternet and see what I've...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-23 00:37:10	@Zaidiinho missed this year. Have you seen gangster squad?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-23 05:30:29	That thunder is crazy!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-23 22:48:09	@Zaidiinho i haven't seen that yet but I have work at 9 so none for me :( gonna give Gangsta Squad a watch over the weekend.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-23 23:01:14	@Zaidiinho I'm just being a perve again and getting my 2hrs of Gosling in again haha let me know what Fast 6 is like, enjoyed 5
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-23 23:23:10	@Zaidiinho that porn ban is hilarious, can you imagine how awkward that phone call will be haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-23 23:35:57	@Zaidiinho I bet a lot of men are hoping its just that! They could set up a helpline to talk through trauma of the awkward phone call haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-23 23:37:41	@Zaidiinho haha obviously some women do, I personally don't but surely 90% of porn watchers have to be males right?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-23 23:40:47	@sardinetrawler @JoeTaylor84 can't be Tanc, he's quoted MD and not Sky Italy.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-23 23:42:35	The thought of work at 9am is upsetting.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-23 11:26:33	@Lee__Woody You going back to the Meridyen, Lee?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-23 11:29:18	@Lee__Woody ah nice one, we go back for 2 weeks on 12th August. Enjoy your holiday :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-24 07:44:00	Last RT, Silvestre's hint isn't all that clear tbh is it? Piqué Left United as did Silvestre and Van Persie joined United.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-24 12:54:04	@Pat_Cunningham yeah and the other played for united and returned to Barca!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-24 17:11:23	Why do all my tweets on my feed have the favourite star next to it, I hardly ever favourite things!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-26 10:57:51	@JoeTaylor84 I think there's been a lot of good things about this game, Kagawa looks good despite his miss, link up is good and Welbeck...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-26 10:58:07	@JoeTaylor84 seems much more confident in front of goal and taking his chances.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-24 18:41:53	@Benno_LUHG let's hope your gut feeling is better this time than last time with regards to Ronaldo and was it 13th July haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-26 11:02:24	@JoeTaylor84 think he just needed reassurances about his importance to us and that he has time. He's had a very good 1st half.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-26 19:04:14	@sardinetrawler @MrScripto @GirlMufc Van Persie is rumoured to have converted to Islam because of his wife too.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-24 22:25:50	@Zaidiinho we all know your age, stop pretending to be down with the kids haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-24 22:44:08	@Zaidiinho you sound like Gizoogle hahaha! I'm just trippin' 😝
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-24 22:53:21	@Zaidiinho hahaha you're autocorrect is having to urban dictionary all this! Marked/merked is a good pun though haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-24 22:55:37	@Zaidiinho yeah you're so witty to have come up with something like that 😝
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-24 23:10:08	@Zaidiinho that's because you follow me, it's rubbed off on you haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-24 23:23:09	@Zaidiinho fucking hell there's people who are of a lesser standard to you? Hahaha just kidding
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-24 23:24:17	@MrScripto it makes me sad that 6ft boys can weigh less than me haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-24 23:25:56	@Zaidiinho its a trait that comes with the arrogance, you should know this 😉
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-29 14:57:31	@Zaidiinho which girl is this? I wanna see what everyone's moaning about haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-30 09:28:07	@buckgb @BusbyMUFC was more of an CAM, sort of a number 10.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-30 09:28:46	@ABJ_MUFC @BusbyMUFC yeah an attacking midfielder, not a CM like he's played now. Played as a number 10 before SAF moved him back.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-30 09:31:32	@ScottCrossland7 @BusbyMUFC I agree, he was played very deep in his first season to improve his defensive side and it slowed his progress
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-30 09:37:56	@ABJ_MUFC @BusbyMUFC yeah you can see how much better he is when he's not having to be defensive. Obv at the time Rooney was on fire aswell
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-30 09:38:07	@_CAN7ONA no problem :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-30 10:01:00	@oranwillis @BusbyMUFC despite his poor shooting, he did play that position and was very good at it haha Brilliant dribbler and vision.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-30 10:01:26	@MU_hammadSalman played behind the strikers in his time at Gremio and Porto.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-30 10:02:21	@kingoje1 he was an amazing dribbler and had a good eye for through balls. Playing box to box hinders his strengths.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-30 11:58:37	@MU_hammadSalman think it was just because that was Rooneys position and he was on fire at the time. Even in 4231 Ando will be used in the 2
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-07-30 09:14:02	@BusbyMUFC and Ando wasn't even a CM when we signed him either!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-02 21:11:03	@Benno_LUHG I just use the wifi of the hotel we stay in so should still get updates. I'm going marmaris, where you going?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-02 23:43:25	@Benno_LUHG yeah I burn a lot and last year it reached 100c! Was in agony. Have you been marmaris before?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-02 23:47:15	@Benno_LUHG yeah do, I use that p20 full sun block. Bar street is good for clubs but expensive, good family bars on beach front too.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-01 16:41:03	@ClareA32 we've just got a full tv, Internet and phone package for £62/m. Includes Sky Sport1+2, bt sport, unlimited Internet etc.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-01 20:28:30	@jackcoleman7 I have a feeling we may be singing this a lot next season!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-02 21:31:33	@Benno_LUHG called Club Meridyen, where you staying?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-02 23:52:27	@Benno_LUHG yeah that p20 is specifically for pale skin. Family bars on the beach front are decent always got shows on and quite relaxed.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-03 00:01:47	@Benno_LUHG yeah that's the one. I'm not sure you know I haven't been to the market there but might give it a go this year.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-02 11:57:07	@Benno_LUHG this is what I've been thinking, I go turkey 12-26th what's the betting we sign everyone in that time haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-05 19:10:10	@Benno_LUHG yeah shuts September 2nd I think
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-05 19:50:58	@Benno_LUHG haha my bad, a lot of people still seem to think it shuts on 31st. We've only got to wait til the 8th anyway apparently haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-07 20:37:53	@VitalMUFC awful thing to post. It was that poor kid that was knocked down on East Lancs so there's a chance a relative could see it too.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-07 17:37:03	@anthonyoneill16 where have you heard this?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-08 20:59:54	@JessicaRosexo1 it's a ball ache, asks you like 40,000 questions before actually buying anything!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-08 21:02:27	@JessicaRosexo1 I have no idea about that bit, i didn't get that far, I got pissed off playing 21 Q's with them haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-08 21:10:47	@JessicaRosexo1 have you tried googling the problem, see if anyone else has had the same things? Google is everyone's friend haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-08 22:19:40	@JoeTaylor84 once Bale moves, it'll trigger all other transfers. Suarez to Real, Roo to CFC.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-08 22:22:18	@JoeTaylor84 Bale will leave, I'm 90% sure of it. Heads been turned.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-08 22:33:51	@Benno_LUHG Bale is holding this shit up! He better get a move on.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-09 07:51:17	Mornings just aren't for me.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-09 08:28:05	@ClareA32 apparently Levy was prepared to do it in instalments but Perez pissed him off when he got wind that he'd booked a hotel room...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-09 08:28:37	@JoeTaylor84 @ClareA32 why 10 days ago?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-09 08:31:23	@JoeTaylor84 @ClareA32 that runs until 14th August doesn't it, read it the other day somewhere.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-09 08:28:21	@ClareA32 for Bale for the unveiling.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-12 08:11:12	Turkey for 2 weeks. Adios motherfuckers!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-13 06:59:47	@Benno_LUHG I'm already doing that, it's bloody boiling!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-13 07:03:06	@Benno_LUHG yeah very! It's in the 80s now but will reach 95 today!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-13 07:16:35	@Benno_LUHG think its 31
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-13 07:27:13	@Benno_LUHG haha there's loads of it! People wearing fake nike blazers and shit haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-14 14:19:53	Turkeyyyy http://t.co/FAjOZjXPdo

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-14 21:35:28	@GeraldGeeO haha that's one thing I won't be missing, i'll find a pub that's showing it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-15 21:03:25	@Benno_LUHG temperatures reached 53 today according to our hotel owners. It was absolutely roasting!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-15 23:16:48	@Benno_LUHG yeah degrees! Was pretty unbearable all day!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-15 23:21:23	@Benno_LUHG yeah I'm having to use a full sun block but then again I am very pale haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-23 19:27:55	@Zaidiinho can graffiti be classed as a verb in a colloquial term?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-23 19:39:25	@Zaidiinho actually doing the graffiti. Was this just a random thing or do you need to know for something?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-23 19:42:44	@Zaidiinho you are a strange one Ali! Although it is something i'd do haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-23 19:38:56	@Zaidiinho yeah I thought that but think it would depend on the context of the sentence. Graffiti as in a type of writing or as in...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-23 19:45:30	@Zaidiinho indeed it is, I'd rather be strange than boring haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-23 19:40:23	@Benno_LUHG I went club areena last year, someone smashed a fishbowl over my feet and had to leave early haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-25 22:26:29	I have the holiday blues and I haven't even left yet! 😞
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-23 19:53:16	@Zaidiinho I know, our twitter handles say it all BeeLee and Zaidiinho hahaha😝
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-27 10:28:44	@fidan_x this happened to me with my Apple ID, was being reset almost everyday and someone downloaded something in Canada!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-27 10:31:28	@fidan_x change your hotmail password too, incase they get a way of getting in there. That's how they were changing mine. Lucky enough...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-27 10:31:38	@fidan_x I removed my bank card details from it x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-31 19:45:49	When they bring their own tissues, you know they've prepared their sob story for a while! #xfactor
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-08-31 20:41:24	@VitalMUFC this is Louis' last year so I assume it will be him.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-09-01 09:09:56	@JoeTaylor84 does he usually start for them Joe?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-09-01 09:13:55	@JoeTaylor84 yeah I've seen him play a few times, he's a very good player just weren't sure if they had other options ahead of him...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-09-01 09:14:10	@JoeTaylor84 I'm sure we'll see if it means anything after the game today
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-09-03 16:07:25	Starting the process for the RAF this week! #excited
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-09-03 16:33:31	“@JessicaRosexo1: you are not leaving me on my own!!!” But you love everyone and everything about stockport college! 😂😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-09-03 16:38:52	@JessicaRosexo1 I spoke to someone today about it, got to ring up this week to start process but not sure how long it'll be so could still..
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-09-03 16:39:19	@JessicaRosexo1 end up doing this year in college ifit takes a while. The timetable for college saddens me though!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-09-10 02:00:09	I might actually have a normal sleeping pattern at some point in my life. 😴
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-09-10 21:20:09	@shazia_dar it was amazing, didn't want to come home! Have you been on holiday anywhere? X

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-09-12 00:53:41	@NapzMusic you have to drive so far in and then walk the rest into the woods I think. It's on Macclesfield road I think x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-09-12 01:12:04	@NapzMusic yeah it is a mission haha And it's like half an hour in the car too! Is supposed to be nice though from what I've heard x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-09-12 01:24:54	@NapzMusic yeah you would do, you not got an iPhone? Soon as u mention the walking bit everyone backs out of going haha x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-09-12 16:36:01	@JessicaRosexo1 @Leahhamiltonn @DannyJRoyle hahaha I'm sorry! Don't think I could cope with stockport college for another year! X

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-09-28 23:38:14	Work on a Sunday morning is a killer 😩
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-02 22:27:16	@Benno_LUHG for helping to speed up your metabolism. I just wanna tone up and strip any fat!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-02 22:39:04	@Benno_LUHG just some guy I know who'd been told about them, said he'd shifted weight quicker than he ever has. Only trying them because...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-02 23:30:09	Amir Khan must have some kind of death wish!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-03 12:20:01	The moment you take someone for granted, is the moment you start to lose them.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-03 20:59:39	Forgot how much I loved Drop Dead Fred 😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-02 22:39:24	@Benno_LUHG I'm struggling to shift this last bit of weight!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-02 22:47:54	@Benno_LUHG yeah was doing a bit of weight training with my pt but my gym shit down and isn't open til end of month so having to try...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-03 20:16:27	Some people should not be allowed on social networking sites 🙈 #cringe
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-04 18:49:03	@MrScripto when?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-05 06:47:25	It's not about being woken up by kids at this time 😴
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-05 13:19:16	Sick of people taking the piss out of me!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-05 23:22:52	I feel like I'm in the inbetweeners movie watching how these people dance!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-05 20:30:51	I've give in and now I'm rushing to get ready to go out! #baabar
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-02 22:17:17	@Benno_LUHG Ben did I see on here a while ago that you did the Insanity workout?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-02 22:20:53	@Benno_LUHG is it any good? I've just got someone to download it for me. Heard you've got to eat a lot which I struggle with!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-02 22:26:44	@Benno_LUHG I mean as in like the 5 small meals, which I'm just never hungry enough for. Been told to get that raspberry ketones are good...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-02 22:48:21	@Benno_LUHG alternatives for now. Hopefully it'll help me lose this last few pound!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-10-03 23:34:09	Love driving about at this time

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-11-04 20:03:15	@Benno_LUHG I watched a video on the new COD multiplayer etc and it looks amazing. Changed loads on it.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-11-04 21:46:02	What the hell am I seeing on Channel 5? Why's she singing a lullaby to a fucking chicken?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-11-05 22:30:32	I got ID'd for COD Ghosts today. It's rated 16. I may have had no make up on but surely I look older than fucking SIXTEEN!

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-11-26 00:28:25	@MU689908 I've never looked through them before, a lot of jacket potatoes with different fillings in there haha!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-11-26 00:40:27	@MU689908 well I'll definitely sleep better now I know that information. He's a bit of a cheese lover isn't he.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-11-30 20:51:05	Nice £50 win on an acca today!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-04 23:06:44	Suarez is unreal
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-04 23:17:38	The fact I'm 20 on Monday, makes me sad.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-11-30 21:27:10	Love that song! #xfactor
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-05 14:21:57	I managed to stay asleep whilst a tree fell into next doors garden and then took me a few hours to even notice it! http://t.co/926g7BnN7G
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-06 06:26:11	Not been asleep yet, it's fair to say I'm fooked!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-10 01:19:27	@MU689908 think blocking him touched a nerve haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-10 01:30:03	@MU689908 Ask him because he seems to certainly remember! You know nothing, wanker haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-10 01:37:54	@MU689908 yeah keep looking over your shoulder, the Duke of Bellington is gonna get revenge with his 'sledgehammer of eternal justice'
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-10 01:42:17	@MU689908 could be, or he's just a boring twat who likes cricket haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-08 04:12:23	I am gonna regret this in the morning!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-08 15:06:39	I'm never drinking ever again.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-07 21:05:46	Celebratory drinks for my 20th tonight. Don't know whether to laugh or cry, feel olddd!

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-11 23:00:40	I don't even watch Towie, but I feel like I need to watch tonight's so I can get involved 🙊
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-12 17:11:29	Need to go Trafford Centre or something. Not one present bought and Christmas is less than 2 weeks away 😰🙈
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-11 23:54:37	This Gemma's a bitchhh!

479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-16 13:18:43	Beyonce Tickets 💃
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-16 13:28:47	@TayaSophie me too! Sort of, I'm in block P just to the left of the stage x
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-19 22:24:05	@raheemhanley you had an angel watching over you that day!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-19 22:25:13	Class of 92 in bed 😴
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-19 22:29:08	@steutd2007 haha I probably should have reworded my tweet better 😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-19 22:30:58	@RuddSam I've only heard good things, finally got the time to watch it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-20 00:46:40	Friends I've had for years showing their true colours, only want to know me when they want something from me!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-20 22:34:59	My Mad Friday consists of a brew in bed 😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-24 11:59:52	Why the fuck did I agree to work Christmas, my next day off now is New Years Day! 😞
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-21 22:20:16	@TayaSophie because their brain is between their legs haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-22 00:26:40	@sardinetrawler top right is a very young Phil Jones haha http://t.co/z7D26sXwoM
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-22 00:28:06	@sardinetrawler you're welcome :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-26 10:17:11	Wish I could be arsed to shop, too tired for that shit.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2013-12-31 14:03:34	@Stubbs89 and the difference between generally and genuinely.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-04 19:51:33	'I'm scared of water, heights and diving' 

Maybe a diving programme wasn't the best of ideas then eh?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-09 22:30:11	The extremities of which we'll go to get that little bit closer to perfection is unbelievable #BotchedUpBodies
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-09 22:54:52	The sub headings under the names on botched up bodies, always make me laugh 😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-09 22:02:35	Botched up bodies is not what I want to be seeing when I'm eating 😖
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-09 22:16:17	Think I'm gonna throw up #channel5
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-14 19:20:51	@Stubbs89 look at Gibbs' face hahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-14 19:23:04	If anyone is even thinking of going to see The Wolf of Wall Street, do it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-14 00:05:18	@sillwuka it's very good, quite funny but some scenes are strange haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-14 00:14:11	@sillwuka yeah 3 hours of people getting high and having sex haha Leonardo is very good in it though
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-14 00:34:48	@sillwuka the fact its based on a true story too makes it all the more crazy. Takes one drug and he can't even walk has to roll 😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-17 16:37:57	Wilbraham road is a joke at this time!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-16 14:09:04	@sardinetrawler the effects of Lemmon 714 is probably the best part of the film 😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-16 14:12:06	@sardinetrawler he is a very underrated actor, thought he was brilliant throughout the film. Might give the book a read at some point.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-19 18:53:45	Saw this and thought you'd love it 😂@MU689908 

https://t.co/vJz7KgLOB7
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-19 23:15:42	@MU689908 I watched it a good 20times 😂 anyone who has the badge tattooed on their heart should be killed haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-22 14:20:48	@JoeTaylor84 did you see what Andy Mitten was supposed to have said on UWS forum?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-22 14:32:15	@Ohniidiaz @JoeTaylor84 I seen a print screen of it and it said "those who make decisions at MU believe he will be an MU player in the...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-22 14:32:47	@Ohniidiaz @JoeTaylor84 next 24 hours. And then rambled about if anyone quotes UWS or him they will not be allowed back on the forum.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-22 14:53:41	@JoeTaylor84 @Ohniidiaz us, not that I'll be complaining though!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-21 00:36:14	@JoeTaylor84 should just offer kagawa as part of the deal, JM is a known admirer and that way he'd have a back up AM who's happy to be a sub
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-22 14:39:53	@Ohniidiaz @JoeTaylor84 I wouldn't pay to go on a forum anyway haha Someone took a screenshot of it and put it on another forum.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-22 14:53:29	@JoeTaylor84 @Ohniidiaz and that's why I wouldn't pay any money to see what's on there haha JM will be making a big mistake selling him to
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-22 23:09:05	@michael_oram01 the 'cerebral palsy' stage is hilarious isn't it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-24 12:56:22	@JoeTaylor84 is he not legit?! Been hanging on his every word haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-24 13:04:44	I absolutely love Mourinho 😂 selling us Mata and trolling Wenger all in the same day!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-24 21:41:34	Over the moon that we've signed Juan Mata 😊
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-24 21:59:02	That Pete Boyle is a bit of a numpty, we've signed Juan Mata and he's moaning about not using overused chants for him 😳
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-24 22:00:17	@ClareA32 he looks good in a suit!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-26 21:30:25	Lee is a compulsive liar, love CBB tonight 😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-26 22:21:01	Where is de diamonddd!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-26 22:30:44	@JoeTaylor84 how do you say that in clicks?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-28 01:22:41	@JoeTaylor84 so annoying that it's not on TV!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-28 01:34:11	@JoeTaylor84 working til 8 too, so probably gonna miss the first half whilst trying to find a decent stream haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-01-31 14:09:32	Saturday at Parklife has got to be done!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-01 22:55:43	Did Adam Johnson just do the Ronaldo celebration?! 😂😭
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-01 14:24:20	Hope we play a 433 with Mata behind the strikers, play RVP and Rooney closer together.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 12:46:06	@triggermike1 not really, why would I regret saying something that was true?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 12:54:09	@triggermike1 yes but at the time of that tweet, was it not true? We had the pretty much the same team as this season and won at a canter.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 12:56:07	Mentions have blown up with city fans hahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 12:59:02	@triggermike1 but does it not show how poor you's were last season that this united team beat you to the title? And it wasn't about the...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 13:00:01	@triggermike1 quality of your team, it was to do with Mancini. You's did well to sack him and bring in Pellegrini.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 13:08:06	@triggermike1 that we lost the greatest manager in our history who got that extra 10% out of average players. Moyes can't do that currently.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 13:26:16	I'd love to sit and talk to all the city fans that have come out the woodwork but there's football on.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 13:28:26	@Zaidiinho one of the best films I've seen!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 13:29:47	@Zaidiinho the cerebral palsy scene is hilarious haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 13:31:33	@Zaidiinho definitely deserves an oscar. Did you know the chest beating scene was something that was just added because they seen...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 13:32:29	@Zaidiinho Matthew McConaughey do it whilst warming up before the scene.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 13:35:34	@Zaidiinho I seen it on graham norton the other day, I thought it was brilliant couldn't get the tune out my head haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 13:37:44	Phones crashed from all the mentions I got from city fans, gonna have to delete the tweet!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 13:52:27	@Zaidiinho I am guilty of doing that sometimes haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 14:23:01	@Zaidiinho he taught them his philosophy of football is that not evident today? 😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-02 15:55:00	@BenLucas12 @TheMUFCVoice I know what team I'd play until the end of the season. Needs to be a 433 to et the best out of our attack.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-04 01:25:01	@Zaidiinho was the interview a re-used one to make him look bad then, because I seen the one where he supposedly said all this?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-04 13:47:58	@ClareA32 I seen a YouTube clip of the supposed interview. Unless the translation was wrong then he did say it.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-04 14:01:31	http://t.co/9BXhyzugdr 

Is this not real then? Ando lying to save face or poor journalism and making quotes up over old interviews? #Ando
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-09 14:25:28	@BusbyMUFC I had the same problem with city fans the other day. I wrote a tweet about how they're title defence was the worst id ever seen..
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-09 14:25:45	@BusbyMUFC last season. Obviously didn't know ours would be worse this season haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-10 23:32:15	David Blaine is the devil 🙊
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-12 13:03:22	@Stubbs89 anyone who thinks or says differently, has absolutely no idea about the financial side of our club.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-12 13:06:42	@Stubbs89 I've seen a few fans on here who seem thankful that they invest our money on players like it should be any different!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-12 13:09:22	@Stubbs89 it's sad that it's got to the point where some actually believe we have no money to invest.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-12 19:12:45	@JoeTaylor84 I'm not a fan of Moyes at the minute but my want for our club to succeed outways anything else.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-16 18:39:34	@Zaidiinho is that the one with Joaquin Phoenix?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-16 21:38:04	@Zaidiinho seen the trailer a while back, looked like the strangest film I'd come across in a while!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-16 21:48:58	@Zaidiinho honestly don't know where they come up with such story lines!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-22 21:08:22	Take me out has got to be one of the most cringeworthy programmes I've seen! 🙈
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-25 22:09:36	@FootballMcD apparently he doesn't say anything at half time, let's Neville give the team talk.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-25 22:12:21	@FootballMcD just something i've heard through people who work at united. Very strange if true though.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-02-27 14:08:32	@TPNStephen have you got any Saturday VIP tickets?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-01 18:42:49	@JoeTaylor84 @ClareA32 what do you's think of this? http://t.co/N6IybPOoLR might need google translate
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-01 18:51:34	@ClareA32 @JoeTaylor84 Felix sounds like a fan of us maybe we should just sign him instead haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-01 20:02:25	@michael_oram01 you's have a hard run of games Feb-March aswell. Congrats on having a baby too :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-06 13:28:53	@sillwuka not a chance would I drive that haha I actually stopped mid conversation because I was in that much shock at it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-06 14:10:22	@sillwuka only if I get to drive it in summer months, get my shades out and I'll look the part haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-06 15:58:27	@sillwuka we'll have to make sure we have a good sound system so you can wind your windows down whilst at the lights on the curry mile 😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-06 13:22:04	@sillwuka I seen one of these driving round reddish the other day haha http://t.co/eVQJwsFy4l
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-14 21:01:07	@Zaidiinho *sunday
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-14 21:03:01	@Zaidiinho we aren't playing in the Far East Ali, I know we have a world wide fan base but we don't have a stadium there too 😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-15 00:09:50	@Zaidiinho have you watched lone survivor?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-15 00:11:25	@Zaidiinho very good film, not sure if I've told you before I've told a few people over the last few weeks though haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-15 00:16:20	@Zaidiinho yeah do, it's based on the true story of Operation Red Wings in Afghanistan :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-15 00:18:20	@Zaidiinho that is fucked up fuckery haha I stream mine on my ps3 so I can tell straight away if it's a good copy and in sync.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-15 00:20:56	@Zaidiinho yeah it is annoying I'd rather watch poor picture quality than one that isn't in sync!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-15 00:23:17	@Zaidiinho I've never seen that either let us know if it's any good :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-15 00:24:47	@Zaidiinho yeah can get tiring when you're already in 'tomorrow' haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-15 00:27:26	@Zaidiinho No 😂 I'm not that stupid. Although there probably is a few people on here who would!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-15 00:32:00	@Zaidiinho or just time in general haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-17 22:17:02	@AranSohal good piece, did you purposely hightlight Nani in red in unanimously? Haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-19 22:37:27	I think I love @D_DeGea what a 'keeper we have!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-21 16:03:08	@BusbyMUFC you're very welcome :)
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-21 15:44:33	@BusbyMUFC apparently cranial osteopathy is good for babies that are teething.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-21 15:49:42	@BusbyMUFC yeah someone I know had two sessions and said it was like having a new baby, so much happier.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-23 00:40:49	@JoeTaylor84 I know haha my little sisters team won, everyone got two tickets. Haven't the foggiest why they would expand!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-23 23:48:43	@_RedSaturn have you read this article, obviously it's just one mans opinion but interesting nevertheless.

http://t.co/qGoor3KnIO
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-23 23:57:09	@_RedSaturn that was not accounted for was instantly shot down too.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-24 00:12:18	@_RedSaturn surely a plane that cruises at speeds of about 565 would knock the building over the other way though, enough for it not to
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-24 00:19:34	@_RedSaturn have had to have explosives in the corners of its structures on so many floors would it?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-24 00:33:39	@_RedSaturn ah I see! There are far too many things that don't add up for us not to believe it was an inside job. Especially that insurance
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-24 00:34:07	@_RedSaturn policy which was taken out 6 weeks before 9/11 and specifically covered terrorist attacks!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-23 00:35:24	@JoeTaylor84 they were giving tickets away as prizes for school football tournaments! Giving them to Anyone who will have them haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-24 00:12:44	@_RedSaturn fall from under itself the way it did. The truth will eventually get out!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-24 15:10:27	Unless they can recover the pieces of the plane, I won't believe for one minute that it's MH370 that they've found.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-24 18:53:21	@_RedSaturn because they can't be arsed looking anymore!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-23 23:56:05	@_RedSaturn wasn't there supposed to be a story told by a soldier about how the flights that took off were then landed in an airfield...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-23 23:56:56	@_RedSaturn and other military planes then carried on course full of explosives? Im sure even before 9/11 any plane that flew over Manhattan
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-24 00:06:01	@_RedSaturn something definitely doesn't add up, can't understand how a building would fall like that when a plane hits it at such speed
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-24 00:18:58	@_RedSaturn Yeah that's the only way I can see how the building came down the way it did. To get such a controlled demolition would surely..
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-24 19:19:05	@kiranh0405 I don't believe for one minute they've found the plane unless they can show us the debris.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-24 19:20:36	@kiranh0405 they've just given up searching and are trying to put an end to speculation. They know more than they are letting on.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 13:04:31	@APMUFC how much for the tickets?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 14:09:07	@Gambo55 is the pair still available?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 22:10:38	The only reason Moyes is still manager is because United's hierarchy i.e. SAF, Charlton are too stubborn to admit they were wrong.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 22:20:01	@drivinginstruct I'm not even surprised or disappointed anymore just embarrassed!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 22:23:47	@drivinginstruct his biggest mistake was getting rid of SAF staff. Neville was nowhere near ready to make the step up to coach a big club
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 22:26:22	@drivinginstruct it shows how inept he is when hes sat on his backside when we're 3-0 down should have been on the touchline bollocking them
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 22:27:41	@MichaelMcc82 it's gonna cost us more in the long run now to sack him and buy out the contract for another manager!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 22:29:35	@drivinginstruct he needs to do what's best now and step down, wouldn't trust him with £ in the summer.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 22:33:44	@alenramic03 it's sad to watch the regression.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 22:34:38	@MichaelMcc82 exactly, too bothered about money to buy out the last couple of months and instead waited til it was up in July!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 22:36:28	@EveForys @drivinginstruct it's sad to watch, gonna cost us a lot to get ourselves out of this mess.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 22:37:31	@alenramic03 exactly, our squad is nowhere near as bad as people make out. The manager just doesn't know how to utilise the players.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 22:44:53	@MichaelMcc82 missing out on Europe didn't affect us as badly back then either when he took over. Costly mistake this by United.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 22:46:07	@alenramic03 any other top manager wouldn't have us outside the top 4 tbf. I've never really believed Moyes was good enough to be here.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 23:03:26	@alenramic03 of course I wanted him to succeed but always doubted he was up to it. Absolutely farce having cleverley on the wing!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 23:04:48	@MichaelMcc82 you could also see that he had plans for them and played attractive football, same with Rodgers last season.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 23:05:46	@alenramic03 I've gone past disappointment etc just embarrassed now.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 23:17:28	@MichaelMcc82 top 3 for me would be Klopp, Simeone or Van Gaal for the short term if no one else is available.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-25 23:21:49	@MichaelMcc82 seen a few people saying Wenger might retire and they're looking at Klopp. If that happens and we still have Moyes then 😡🙈
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-27 22:26:05	@JoeTaylor84 I don't suppose any kind of shit is great especially when it's on you hahaha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-03-26 22:04:55	Hahaha that Malachy reminds me of them stress balloons you got as kids! http://t.co/E1xfpgkvBY

479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-04-12 20:14:13	@_RedSaturn yep. At one point I was getting download speed of 8.68kbps! When I should have been getting 32.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-04-12 20:16:14	@_RedSaturn at the minute we're getting very good signal but it's very inconsistent.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-04-12 20:20:14	@_RedSaturn yeah downloaded an app so I can check it occasionally. Was gonna change everything over to sky but we have too many trees 😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-04-12 20:25:48	@_RedSaturn yeah apparently we'd have to have a satellite pole installed to receive signal but they don't like doing them haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-04-13 22:55:13	@_RedSaturn haha these would work better if you could find a way to post a link to the picture, kind of ruins it that you can see it under
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-04-13 22:55:38	@_RedSaturn your tweet haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-04-13 23:01:28	@_RedSaturn the feet ones you were posting were hilarious, didn't realise what you were doing til a few later but that's just because I

479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-04-30 12:07:58	@JackEC_mufc one audition in front of producers and if you get through you go back Sunday in front of Simon etc
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-04-30 12:19:36	@_SaturnVI looked like he was gonna break out into the Macarena haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-04-30 12:22:25	@JackEC_mufc ah I see, got a couple of relatives going in for it. They knew they'd have to go back Sunday but thought it was judges.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-04-30 12:23:26	@_SaturnVI well there has always been rumours about him being gay!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-04-30 12:25:18	@JackEC_mufc yeah, all a scam. My two relatives have been turned away before, both can sing but they'd rather have shit entertainment value.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-04-30 12:25:56	@_SaturnVI he'll have the straw sun hats out too haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-05-20 00:27:04	Neil Custis has been on the beers I see 😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-05-20 00:43:36	@JoeTaylor84 I've had a look through most tweets but can't find it anywhere. He's definitely had a few drinks, started for no reason haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-05-20 00:39:31	@JoeTaylor84 I know! and then he wonders why people don't take him or his paper seriously. Did that Raf really threaten him?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-06-05 21:02:29	And that's why I love being a Manchester United fan #LifeOfRyan
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-06-13 20:53:24	Man almighty am I glad that football is back, what a game!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-06-15 22:19:43	@JackEC_mufc not quite as explosive on the ball as he used to be, still a freak of nature though haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-06-15 22:26:46	@JackEC_mufc yeah I think so too, always preferred watching Ronaldo anyway probably because he was ours at one point haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-06-17 23:24:45	Akinfeev has had a mare there!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-06-17 12:27:02	@JackEC_mufc Blind prefers to play DM doesn't he?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-06-17 12:51:56	@JackEC_mufc he can play DM CB and LB but prefers midfield. De Boer thinks his best position is the traditional no 6.
http://t.co/GcYiXOH5iF
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-06-17 12:56:46	@JackEC_mufc yeah wouldn't mind a couple of the Dutch players but we need a couple of world class players too.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-06-18 21:01:10	Full rejuvenation needed for Spain!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-06-30 10:58:14	@Stubbs89 I had this same conversation with 3 men yesterday! All thought there was no contact haha!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-06-30 11:11:49	@Stubbs89 I was struggling to understand how they came to that conclusion. Sure he was theatrical, but definite contact on top of his foot!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-06-30 11:19:37	@Stubbs89 I don't think there was enough for him to go down like he did but definitely enough to stop his run, just think if the defender...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-06-30 11:20:01	@Stubbs89 is silly enough to put his foot in he has to face the fact they will go down.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-07-08 17:04:21	@JackEC_mufc @RobbieSavage8 I don't understand what point he's trying to make!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-07-08 17:08:10	@JackEC_mufc @RobbieSavage8 clearly not, it's embarrassing that he gets paid for these opinions.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-07-10 21:25:12	@Stubbs89 I do too, I know someone who has said it is done but we'll have to wait I guess!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-07-19 17:57:13	@Stubbs89 Blind prefers to play DM so maybe it's just for cover in midfield
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-07-19 18:14:19	@Stubbs89 yeah can play CB aswell so I suppose he would be useful!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-07-31 22:12:23	There isn't half some doom mongers on here when it comes to United!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-07-31 22:26:27	@JoeTaylor84 it's getting boring reading the same shit all day from the same people, must be draining to be that negative all the time!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-07-31 22:45:01	@JoeTaylor84 Im so excited for the new ssn under LvG regardless of signings. God knows what they would be like if Moyes was still in charge!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-08-12 09:21:22	RIP Robin Williams!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-08-12 09:23:24	Depression is an illness. Anyone that says differently has either never had it or is too ignorant to understand it.

479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-08-21 23:54:19	@its_standard so if we're saying you have to be born with it for it to be a disease, that means Ebola isn't either.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-08-21 23:58:05	@its_standard giving up something isn't that simple, otherwise we would never have people who abuse substances for such lengths of time.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-08-22 00:08:31	@its_standard there are diseases you can get without being born with it or catching it. You acquire them due to other factors.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-08-22 00:10:58	@its_standard I'm not saying he acquired alcoholism, I'm saying your point is void that you have to be born with or catch a disease.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-08-22 00:13:18	@its_standard when he first drank alcohol he wouldn't have known he would have become an alcoholic.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-08-22 00:15:29	@its_standard it's no longer self abuse when it's an addiction, it's a mental illness. I'm no longer debating this because you're...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-08-22 00:16:20	@its_standard obviously very close minded when it comes to things like this. I hope you never have to deal/live with such things because...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-08-22 00:16:41	@its_standard it's a horrible thing to go through or watch someone you love go through.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-08-21 21:21:19	@its_standard alcoholism is a disease
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-08-20 22:25:10	@Stubbs89 @Malachians he said it last night aswell. Seems Makay has been putting on a nice guy facade for some time!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-08-22 09:11:40	@its_standard and you're ignorant now go away
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-08-28 23:57:52	@MU689908 funniest thing I've read on here in a while 😂

479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-09-04 10:43:31	@BusbyMUFC was it just me who found him rather annoying?!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-09-06 19:21:22	@_SaturnVI it's bullshit from some of them but a lot of them probably never got through to the judge auditions so we wouldn't see them
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-09-06 19:25:18	@_SaturnVI there were 2 this year. My sister and cousin can both sing but never get through first auditions. The voice is a better set up.

479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-10-01 10:56:39	@Stubbs89 I had to go last night as my little sister was a flag bearer, the attendance and atmosphere was a joke! Roma fans were brilliant!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-10-01 11:18:22	@Stubbs89 agreed, can't understand why they'd expand! http://t.co/9u2PoqoCQD
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-10-01 11:49:00	@Stubbs89 absolutely ridiculous for a European game. The were singing 'we're not really here' which I thought was quite fitting!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-12-20 16:24:02	Never a red that
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-12-30 21:04:45	@O2 I'm on an F&amp;F discount but my bill is still coming in full price, any ideas why? I've rang customer services but keep being fobbed off.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2014-12-31 11:49:54	@O2 thank you, the 'live chat' was very helpful! Hopefully all sorted now.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-01-04 20:08:37	I'm sorry to say, again, it's Moyseh
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-01-14 22:29:48	Bit protective over that badge 😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-01-14 22:41:46	@JoeTmufc I am thanks Joe, are you?
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-01-14 22:50:18	@JoeTmufc me too, would love to see falcao go on a run now and bag a couple against QPR.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-01-14 23:00:19	@JoeTmufc yeah I've never wanted a player to succeed as much at Utd, think RVP having a slight injury has come at the right time.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-01-18 21:10:07	Such a shame that Pogba never worked out for us, quality midfielder.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-01-18 22:10:59	Anyone know what this Gone is like before I put myself through the 2 hours of it
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-01-18 22:13:24	@JoeTmufc ta. Will watch the first half hour and see what it's like seeing as there is sod all else on!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-01-20 21:02:51	Brilliant that from sterling
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-01-21 16:45:40	@footballmcd think subotic was always the better defender but hummels was the better footballer of the pair
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-01-21 22:20:40	“@SolitaNQ: #SolitaManchesterWheel  £50 with fries on sale Friday feeds 6 people or 1 fat bastard. http://t.co/VcaByQjxu4” got to try it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-01-23 21:57:40	Some of the players we have in our squad are stealing a living!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-01-31 14:12:12	A bit light in midfield but should be fun going forward. I'd have had Herrera over Januzaj.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-03 19:24:52	@Baron_Dean think there's been an attitude problem with Herrera which is why he's being left out
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-07 14:32:19	What a header from Kane! Arsenal have been battered today
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-08 17:07:09	@Stubbs89 just said the exact same thing! Needs to stop being so stubborn and play Herrera
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-08 17:11:10	Makes no sense to have Rooney in midfield when Herrera is on the bench. Rooney would offer something else up top alongside falcao/RvP
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-08 17:14:45	Falcao and RVP just don't play well together, both make the same runs. They need someone who's willing to drop off and give them space
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-22 12:34:52	@AranSohal they didn't, SAF wanted Mou but Bobby Charlton despises him which is why they never asked him.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-22 12:38:05	@AranSohal definitely, Mou apparently never hid the fact he wanted to manage Utd at events but obviously Charlton meant more to the club
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-22 12:53:08	@AranSohal of course, if it was down to me I would have took Mou but the club seemed to underestimate the genius of SAF and thought anyone..
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-22 12:53:18	@AranSohal could carry on where he left off.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-22 13:02:31	@AranSohal think because the glazers aren't footballing men, they were blinded by the fact that SAF won the title with that squad.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-22 13:13:23	@AranSohal don't think anyone fully anticipated how much of a loss Gill would be until he went.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-22 15:34:12	Don't know what's funnier, lukaku's demise or Everton as a whole 😂😂
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-22 15:36:34	@Stubbs89 yeah think they just edge it haha they've been awful this season!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-22 17:01:07	Some of the worst refereeing I've seen in a while
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-22 17:02:09	On second thought, probably ever!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-23 21:59:41	What a shite ending to Broadchurch that was!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-02-28 18:36:14	Proper depressing you lot, we won didn't we? That's all that matters at this point in the season.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-03-04 17:47:58	@MU689908 we have to if we aspire to be at their level one day
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-03-07 18:17:28	There's football on and my dads sat watching Come Dine With Me 😣
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-03-16 21:59:46	Not worried about Liverpool, as long as we play like we did v THFC then we'll win.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-03-22 14:46:22	What a fucking goal!!!!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-03-20 12:24:23	“@tancredipalmeri: Bad draw for Atletico, decent draw for Real Madrid” how?! lol
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-03-22 23:44:44	Still can't get over Mata's second goal, the audacity to even try it!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-03-23 23:37:28	@JackEC_mufc I don't believe you can just lose your ability like that, Torres the exception and I think even his was more his confidence.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-03-23 23:44:46	@JackEC_mufc don't think he was ever particularly fast, just managed to time his runs very well
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-03-23 23:14:20	@JackEC_mufc think we'll regret letting him go, massively.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-03-25 20:09:08	@TheBugzyMalone is so so good!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-04-04 13:07:35	Gone Girl has got to have one of the shittest endings to a film, I've ever seen!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-04-12 17:37:55	I fucking love Louis Van Gaal!!!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-04-12 17:45:25	Never in a million years would I have thought that we'd get 9 points from the Spurs, Liverpool and City games
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-04-17 13:28:28	@Stubbs89 well he's already said he's trying to recover 2 of them (Jones&amp;Blind) so wouldn't be surprised to see them in the line up tomorrow
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-04-17 13:37:41	@Stubbs89 think we'll win if we can get blind &amp; Jones back. Blind at DM and shaw at LB should be enough defensively
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-04-18 15:44:18	Could be worse, could still have Moyes and be attempting 81 crosses a game.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-02 10:35:27	Such sad news about @rioferdy5 wife, thoughts are with his family.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-10 12:40:27	You could hear a pin drop at the Etihad, what a shite bunch of fans.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-12 20:04:25	Lewandowski is so so good
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-16 14:45:28	@Stubbs89 Hermes threw a parcel of tablets from Holland&amp;Barrett over my gate where my dog was, she ate them. 5days later she passed away...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-16 14:46:42	@Stubbs89 i rang H&amp;B for advice on whether they were harmful and they said no because they were herbal, Hermes took no responsibility!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-16 14:47:58	@Stubbs89 they honestly don't care, every parcel we ever had delivered went over the gate and was chewed to pieces by our dog.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-17 18:12:07	@JackEC_mufc he had so much going for him aswell! How people can say alcoholism isn't a disease is beyond me
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-17 18:25:47	@JackEC_mufc will be sad if it has beaten him, just shows alcoholism does not discriminate.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-17 18:06:25	@JackEC_mufc fuck sake, looks terrible! So sad to see someone this low.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-18 11:12:54	😂 I fuckin love LVG https://t.co/d0HAbc0v1C
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-18 21:03:38	@JoeTmufc I'd say he's pretty much nailed on for City.
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-28 19:52:07	@JackEC_mufc thought it was just me that thought that magic trick was poo!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-28 19:55:17	@JackEC_mufc there were so many flaws in it. It isn't really magic when you ask the person to tell you the word before you reveal yours haha
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-28 19:59:36	@JackEC_mufc the thing that bugged me was that we never got to see the judges cards and it isn't like a helicopter is particularly small...
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-28 20:00:57	@JackEC_mufc so surely everyone will have been aware that there was a helicopter in the studio. Like you said was pretty basic and shite!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-28 20:05:28	@JackEC_mufc I know was completely baffled at him winning! gullible twats, all I did was pick out flaws the entire time he was on stage!
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-05-31 19:18:41	Bit annoying her isn't she
479005026	BeeLee_93	2015-06-14 19:59:49	@Stubbs89 think we'll regret letting him go, massively!
