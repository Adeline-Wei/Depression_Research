48666639	timohoffmann	2014-01-17 14:26:32	#ttdc14 Session on #roadsafety is filling up quickly. Same attendance as yesterday I would say.
48666639	timohoffmann	2014-01-17 14:31:50	#ttdc14 Message from Gómez of Spanish traffic police a little blunt and predictable. "Enforcement is the best method to achieve results"#idk
48666639	timohoffmann	2014-01-17 14:34:57	#TTDC14 Joan Todt of @fia does mention the importance of road infrastructure, education and vehicle tech next to enforcement 4 #roadsafety
48666639	timohoffmann	2014-01-17 14:39:41	.@NkemEKalu i agree enforcemt is important &amp; effective. But it's not the most important tool. There has to be an integrated approach. #IMHO
48666639	timohoffmann	2014-01-17 14:47:56	@NkemEKalu you are right. We are on the same page here. Let's meet up in the coffee break?

48666639	timohoffmann	2014-01-17 15:09:44	#TTDC14 Comment from @EMBARQNetwork staff: reducing exposure by providing mobility options is important. Agree. Intermodal Planning needed!
