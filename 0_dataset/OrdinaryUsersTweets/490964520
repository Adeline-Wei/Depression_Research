490964520	JasonSloan2	2014-05-11 19:30:16	At least I don't claim people as my friends when really they don't like you. Choose the time you want to spend with people wisely.
490964520	JasonSloan2	2014-05-12 00:08:19	I don't get why everyone is making a big deal about Michael Sam. Yeah he's gay, so what? He's a hell of an athlete and isn't any different.

490964520	JasonSloan2	2015-04-27 03:57:32	Say not in grief "He is no more" but live in thankfulness that he was.
490964520	JasonSloan2	2015-04-29 03:07:01	I swear I'll never be happy again,

490964520	JasonSloan2	2015-05-23 16:10:45	Nobody is "too busy" for anyone. It's a matter of you making the time.
490964520	JasonSloan2	2015-05-25 03:00:31	Why must I be so stupid. 😔
490964520	JasonSloan2	2015-06-02 21:34:51	So a felon with a pedafile can buy a house but a felon with a drug possession can't? Don't you just love America? :)
490964520	JasonSloan2	2015-06-02 20:43:12	Getting off work an hour early so you can beat i25 traffic ☺️
490964520	JasonSloan2	2015-06-04 13:08:50	You should vote yes on the marijuana tax bill so it can go to the schools and construction!!!

490964520	JasonSloan2	2015-06-14 17:00:06	It gets to a point in life where you've taken enough hits, and making a profound statement means everything to you.
490964520	JasonSloan2	2015-06-19 00:59:55	I love talking to my grandma, it's nice to be able to talk to someone who can carry out a conversation for longer than 5 minutes.
490964520	JasonSloan2	2015-06-20 20:26:01	So glad to be back in the south ☺️
490964520	JasonSloan2	2015-06-20 23:44:08	If you have to complain to Twitter that you didn't cheat on your significant other, chances are, YOU PROBABLY CHEATED ON THEM!!!
490964520	JasonSloan2	2015-06-20 00:05:25	It's sad how marines aren't guaranteed food meals or uniforms anymore. Instead we have to pay to feed people on welfare. How sad.
