49438467	Samueltadros	2012-09-26 01:23:38	@SciencePyramid @Egyptianism I am sorry, this is nonsense. There was an outrage against this ad. NY refused to put it and Geller won case
49438467	Samueltadros	2012-09-26 01:24:08	@SciencePyramid @Egyptianism so the other side aint nice guys, that makes destroying their property fine?
49438467	Samueltadros	2012-09-26 01:26:06	@SciencePyramid @Egyptianism so what? That removes their free speech rights? That allows destroying their property?

49438467	Samueltadros	2012-10-04 02:45:55	@DaliaEzzat_ Jeez, lets see, a conservative supporting a conservative candidate, that is surprising because ... ?
49438467	Samueltadros	2012-10-04 02:46:32	@DaliaEzzat_ but my Lol was not on Obama. It was on the clown you retweeted :)

49438467	Samueltadros	2012-10-10 16:58:52	Men who dare to rule based on evidence, who are not afraid of a regime, and who dare to stand against the mob.
49438467	Samueltadros	2012-10-10 17:04:29	Men have been found to resist the most powerful monarchs and to refuse to bow down before them, but few indeed have been found to resist ...
49438467	Samueltadros	2012-10-10 17:05:08	... the crowd, to stand up alone before misguided masses, to face their implacable frenzy without weapons and with folded arms to dare ...

49438467	Samueltadros	2012-10-12 20:52:23	@dandoonyboon @SciencePyramid @RamyYaacoub Sentence refers to lessons minorities have learned. It is a descriptive sentence not a prefrence

49438467	Samueltadros	2012-11-04 08:25:10	@mahazja Yup. One year and 2 months. Never finished. It was after AUC and before I had a job, then got a job, got busy so never went back.

49438467	Samueltadros	2012-11-24 07:47:17	The MB is still viewing the world through the premise of the oppressed opposition. Still fighting from the trenches
49438467	Samueltadros	2012-12-02 16:51:27	The only way to defeat this constitution is by attacking it from a conservative platform. اللهم إني قد بلغت اللهم فاشهد
49438467	Samueltadros	2012-12-02 16:59:32	@Karmh1 The articles to mobilize the countryside with against this constitution are 14, 15, and 24 and nothing else
49438467	Samueltadros	2012-12-06 13:38:05	@melhoshy @mwhanna1 @SaraLabib Of course I take @EricTrager18 seriously. No one who remotly can identify Egypt on a map shouldn't.
49438467	Samueltadros	2012-12-06 13:39:05	@melhoshy No it doesn't. Egyptians have a complex view of the role of the state, yes some expect a nany state but most have a fear of gov

49438467	Samueltadros	2012-12-08 13:04:49	Not sure why people are surprised or angry with the Guardian Editorial. It fits perfectly with their crappy coverage of Egypt for 2 years
49438467	Samueltadros	2012-12-08 13:09:03	@Magednas Nope (Why are you asking me here and not on facebook, I am hardly ever on twitter)
49438467	Samueltadros	2012-12-05 14:25:28	Who knew, besides fancying himself an expert on Egypt, the clown also fancies himself an expert on Fascism!

49438467	Samueltadros	2012-12-07 10:30:59	@melhoshy in the south especially it is much more historical. You have to realize, government always failed those people

49438467	Samueltadros	2012-12-15 21:24:42	@melhoshy @Ikhwanweb this is normal. Many small stations close early.

49438467	Samueltadros	2012-12-15 21:43:38	The referendum will pass. With a huge margin.
49438467	Samueltadros	2012-12-15 21:45:34	@melhoshy I am confused, what are you talking about?

49438467	Samueltadros	2012-12-15 23:02:45	@evanchill it wont
49438467	Samueltadros	2012-12-15 23:40:33	@Bassem_Sabry @Nervana_1 I agree with the 65 this round. Higher next one.
49438467	Samueltadros	2012-12-15 23:45:44	@evanchill @ayouti @Bassem_Sabry Delta will vote yes.
49438467	Samueltadros	2012-12-15 23:49:30	@MohamedHawary @Bassem_Sabry @Nervana_1 There was no reason for average Egyptians to vote No. Besides no one mobilized them

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 02:02:43	@melhoshy @Esmat__ why would they? They share nationalist discourse.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 02:12:55	@melhoshy @Esmat__ who says the military is a political player aslan. That's the whole point
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 02:23:24	@melhoshy @Esmat__ what happened on Feb 11? It was Mubarak's decision. The military is a bureaucratic institution with a nationalist flavor
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 02:37:09	@melhoshy @Esmat__ I am curious how anything in Egypt can be described as if it's US or EU
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 02:37:51	@melhoshy @Esmat__ No they don't. They believe their work (they would never call it interest) is the same as nationalist interest
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 02:38:24	@melhoshy @Esmat__ Because you had hundreds of thousands of men being returned to civilian life in 74 with no future
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 02:38:57	@melhoshy @Esmat__ men who were trained to kill. You had to find a place for those men. It was actually an act of genius
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 02:46:05	@melhoshy @Esmat__ sure. They are not angels of course. My problem is not with making them devils because they are angels.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 02:47:00	@melhoshy @Esmat__ my problem is that all this nonsense about deep state, 7okm el askar and the likes is a) wrong b) blinds you to reality
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 02:47:42	@melhoshy @Esmat__ Mubarak effect. This is Mubarak's military, though not in the sense people think.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 02:48:17	@melhoshy @Esmat__ why are you comparing serious countries with Egypt?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 02:49:14	@melhoshy @Esmat__ there is no damn institution. There are individuals. Yes x is a governor. That is meaningless. NO INSTITUTION
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 02:53:07	@melhoshy @Esmat__ when you have a state, lets talk about functions of its military
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 02:53:48	@melhoshy @Esmat__ Egypt is a failed state. First prevent Hobbes' War, then talk to me about acountability
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 02:57:30	@melhoshy @Esmat__ wait a second, you comparing an ideological group bonded by ideology to Egy military????
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 03:00:41	@melhoshy @Esmat__ If there was 7okmn el askar, I would be at the first lines of the battle fighting it :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-10 03:05:54	@melhoshy @Esmat__ Yup. My problem is with what I see as mythological description of reality which blinds one to what is really taking place
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-15 01:36:47	On Planet NYT, the MB is called "Islamist party allied with President Mohamed Morsi"
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-17 22:50:14	Seriously, who cares? http://t.co/HEefvEA They wouldn't have gotten 10,000 votes anyway
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-20 17:46:02	Rule: Anyone who throws around a prediction on elections results without even knowing names of candidates in each district is nuts
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-21 02:15:15	@minoushy anyone. Egyptians like other people vote for individuals.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-22 19:37:35	An article written by Mohamed Morsi in 2009 calls Jews ... surprise surprise ... grandsons of apes and swines http://t.co/eOVvecJ
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-18 23:18:59	Unbelievable how much confusion the wrong translation by AMAY of the Egyptian constitution has created
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-18 23:25:33	@iaskmaie Article 10 where they removed the word society in translation from responsibility of family
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-18 23:26:40	@iaskmaie Article 5 where they added "alone" to sovereignty of people, though it was removed in constitution
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-24 18:33:42	@iaskmaie @AhmedWagih oh, I am sorry, I don't want crazies following me, you can always copy and paste all you want :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-19 06:41:52	Not a single Church building permit was issued in Egypt since the revolution http://t.co/kP9BDqC
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-25 18:21:32	@miriamamir check my answer on facebook
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-25 19:25:15	Every demonstration you organize, every stone you throw, every building you attack, more voters will vote for the MB in the next elections
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-25 19:26:02	Egyptian chatterbox class learned absolutely nothing in past two years. They still know nothing about how a guy in Fayyoum or Behira thinks
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-25 19:28:14	@SciencePyramid Good point :) One of them wrote on twitter about the "city of Behira" :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-23 21:48:13	According to the Muslim Brotherhood in 2010, the Holocaust is a hoax fabricated by the CIA http://t.co/XOWDf6C
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-26 02:14:55	The Muslim Brotherhood's disgusting sectarian rhetoric http://t.co/Yve1wXK
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-24 18:28:47	More fascist gangs are emerging in Egypt, how exciting
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-24 18:30:14	@joshuahersh Err, what burgeoning democracy!
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-24 18:30:53	@AhmedWagih Why can't you?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-24 18:35:08	One would have thought that facts in Egypt in the past two years would have had any effect on analysis. Nope, none.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-26 23:39:27	@EricTrager18 when was the army a political player in the first place?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-26 23:47:29	@EricTrager18 Bureaucrats, technocrats, not political players :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-27 20:35:55	He should have been firmer and shown less anger
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-01-27 20:38:18	@alkharashy Port Said voted for Shafik
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-01 06:43:46	Someone should inform WP that the Egyptian revolution was indeed led by "gangs of hooligans, angry and restless youth" http://t.co/HlP7I6H
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-01 18:43:49	Those shocked by the state of anarchy in Egypt and the risk of collapse have been living on another planet for the past two years
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-01 18:46:44	@SciencePyramid It was a building that had been painted recently. Looked great from the outside, while rats had eaten the whole interior
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-01 18:44:27	The Egyptian state collapsed on the 28th of January 2011. Not the regime. The STATE. It has not recovered since.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-01 20:18:55	Compared to the opposition, the Islamists have actually acted saner and shown more restraint
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-06 00:13:03	@cerenomri @TimesofIsrael We have already had those in metro for years now, cant see why it would be a hoax, just an expansion of policy
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-01 18:45:46	What happened two years ago was neither a military coup nor a revolution (Islamist or liberal). It was a state collapse.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-09 16:53:23	Eric Trager seems to have annoyed the right pieces of scum @EricTrager18
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-14 04:30:57	No statement exemplifies delusional mindset of Thawristas more than claim Egypt witnessed liberal revolution that was hijacked by Islamists
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-14 04:31:11	It was neither liberal nor a revolution in the first place and without the Islamists the regime would not have fallen.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-14 04:01:41	Simply the best article written describing revolutionaries http://t.co/mos4sKo

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-14 20:01:02	@HaniSabra @mmabrouk As Hani said. They will.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-20 22:43:36	@melhoshy @HaniSabra @mmabrouk If I remember correctly I got Port Said wrong and was off by 200,000 in difference between Morsi and Shafik
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-20 22:44:26	@melhoshy @HaniSabra @mmabrouk when we get closer and names are announced I can give you results by seat. Cant do that without candidates :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-24 01:09:05	@madel1983 @mgyassa @SaraLabib @RanyaKhalifa point is, no one but Gabha clowns will boycott. Real people with base in districts will run
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-26 05:54:25	@RamyYaacoub Well, I would go further and claim there is no Turkish model in the first place
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-26 17:08:15	There are actually human beings living among us who are still talking about Egypt's transition to Democracy. Frightening
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-26 17:56:15	Someone tells me @tcwittes said that a lot of Copts voted for Morsi! Did she say that?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-26 18:45:34	@whsahhar @bassemk 2275 telephone interviews :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-26 21:28:49	@tcwittes thanks for the clarification
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-24 23:46:13	@DavidJandura They didn't also demand winning in advance?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-24 23:58:24	What wars is Morsi talking about that were forced on the people?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-25 03:53:08	@melhoshy I am surprised anyone reads Stratfor or takes it seriously
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-02-25 04:28:52	@melhoshy their problem like everyone else is they depend on the locally produced nonsense
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-03-01 06:10:16	@DaliaEzzat_ @SaraLabib @Libraliyya Thanks Dalia

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-03-07 01:25:27	@stevenacook @ZNovetsky the tweets are in the article and I assume you can read Arabic
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-03-07 01:28:50	@JeffreyGoldberg @stevenacook @ZNovetsky 1. tweets were written on different occassions 2. She never claimed account hacked except today
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-03-07 01:29:38	@JeffreyGoldberg @stevenacook @ZNovetsky 3. she replied to comments on some of those tweets 4. similar themes are echoed in her blog
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-03-01 20:05:58	An excellent piece by @stevenacook http://t.co/yHBaHmZwqk
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-03-07 17:39:58	Q's on Samira: 1. If your account had been hacked, wouldn't you tell that to your followers after you retrieve it and delete the tweets?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-03-07 17:40:40	Q's On Samira: 2. Why is the first claim that your account was hacked made after the State Department is made aware of your tweets?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-03-07 17:42:15	Q's on Samira: 3. Why is there anti American rhetoric on your blog full, was that also hacked?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-03-07 18:26:47	Q to Samira: Was account also hacked on 11 September when you tweeted regarding the Innocence of Muslims movie? https://t.co/NLiIOrrx7b
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-03-07 19:42:51	Proud of so many Egyptian activists who stood against Samira's racism. It is because of you that there might one day be hope for Egypt

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-03-24 21:00:49	@melhoshy Seems Egy political scientists need to be taught ABC of politics: ALL POLITICS IS LOCAL. Morsi wont be on ballot, local guy is
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-02 19:30:57	State should hire a grownup to run the @USEmbassyCairo twitter account
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-04 01:49:16	It seems I am the only one who doesn't think the Bassem Youssef episode is pre-planned or part of an assault on freedom of expression
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-04 01:52:37	@sotsoy even that is assuming too much competence in Egyptian officials
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-04 05:42:10	@IsraelMatzav This is a parody account

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-07 14:02:12	It is scary to realize that there are people who still believe that Mubarak orchestrated attacks on Copts.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-07 14:44:12	@Sarahngb Not the first time. It was attacked by police during the Wafaa Qostantien episode.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-07 14:45:56	@RamyYaacoub @Sarahngb I was there
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-07 15:06:35	@RamyYaacoub @Sarahngb They climbed the walls, removed parts of the roof of St. Peter's Church and threw them inside

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-09 01:39:26	Copts get killed because they are Copts, and pseudo intellectuals insist that we should not call them Copts, but Egyptians.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-09 01:50:13	@ckilada I am afraid I am not a fan of the national unity discourse
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-09 01:55:30	@ckilada In 1919, during height of national unity discourse, mobs finished demonstrations and then burned churches :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-09 01:56:13	@ckilada By noting that they are "two factions" you have highlighted the key contradiction in the discourse
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-09 01:57:46	@ckilada Have a long critique of national unity discourse in forthcoming book "Motherland Lost: The Egyptian and Coptic Quest for Modernity"
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-09 02:01:33	@MarinaKilada @ckilada If that was the case, why did Copts demand proportional representation in 1923 constitution?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-09 02:06:57	@ckilada @MarinaKilada But the British didnt leave until 1954 :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-09 02:07:48	@ckilada @MarinaKilada I am not sure that was ever offered in order for it to be rejected
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-08 23:38:52	Nothing is more disgusting than attempting to take away the identity of the murdered from them. They are Copts, whether you like it or not.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-10 20:41:21	@DaliaEzzat_ @PatrickKingsley claims MB not worse than Mubarak on gender.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-10 20:42:45	@DaliaEzzat_ @PatrickKingsley really? Constitution is ambiguous on free speech and minorities? Has he even read it?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-12 04:58:58	@sotsoy 5,000 in the past 6 months

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-13 17:28:54	And the award of the dumbest article written on Egypt goes to Atef Said http://t.co/eEJhp4MtSd

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-19 15:18:40	And the award for the most idiotic article written about Copts goes to .... no surprise Tamer Wagih http://t.co/nBGDQVUxmc
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-04-19 15:26:27	@SciencePyramid Here is the thing, you (Tamer Wagih) know nothing about Copts or sectarianism, why on earth do you decide to write about it?

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-01 02:27:41	@kosharipotomac @MarinaKilada On what basis is that claim made? As I mentioned 3/4 members supported plus 4 bishops sent their support
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-01 02:28:13	@kosharipotomac @MarinaKilada elected coptic bodies (Milli council) supported so did Protestant one plus thousands of signatures
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-01 02:29:21	@kosharipotomac @MarinaKilada I discuss the whole episode in my forthcoming book.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-01 02:29:54	@kosharipotomac @MarinaKilada I am not of course suggesting majority supported (no polling was done), but based on available info, many did
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-01 02:43:45	@kosharipotomac @MarinaKilada If I ever finish the horrible task of reviewing the index :)

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-15 22:08:29	@kosharipotomac @SciencePyramid @jstacher Yeah I am suggesting they didn't. 5 kids is not a community :)

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-15 22:09:08	@kosharipotomac @SciencePyramid @jstacher Protestants did. Copts didn't.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-19 18:17:37	@NermienRiad which Bishop Maximos?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-19 23:34:11	@NermienRiad my favorite clergyman. He is my Bishop and I was his disciple years ago.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-23 10:50:43	@kristenchick nice article but there is no "Archbishop Sarabamon El Shayeb". He is a monk, not an archbishop.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-23 13:10:53	@AhmedWagih Yeah that would be the greatest fear. Something along the lines of Ali Shariati
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-21 02:49:15	@Bassem_Sabry yeah, that was a sentence written in the wrong place.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 15:03:07	People dismiss Shafik and campaign as NDP. They thus miss what Shafik stood for, how he got votes, and lessons learned
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 15:13:02	@ahmose_I Hamdeen had no campaign. Only benefited from collapse of Moussa
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 15:14:25	@stevenacook How do you expect an answer if I can't DM you?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 15:25:30	@ahmose_I what revolutionary? the 5 clowns who boycotted? who cares?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 15:25:59	@ahmose_I Nope, the results actually correlate with MB results in parliament individual seats
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 15:30:44	@ahmose_I who ever said Shafik got votes because of liberals?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 15:31:18	@ahmose_I you actually think anyone in Gharbia or Behira knows who these people are or cares less what they think?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 15:31:35	@ahmose_I 2nd round had 3 million more votes than round 1
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 15:42:21	@ahmose_I No, check the numbers again. Cairo voted Shafik with 300,000 difference
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 15:59:55	@ahmose_I There is no pattern. Egyptians are not machines. MB machine has a certain base. People overestimated it after parliament &amp;
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 16:00:03	@ahmose_I underestimate it now
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 16:00:37	@ahmose_I people who worked for Shafik would not have worked for hamdeen in round 2
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 16:51:34	@stevenacook since I can't reply in a DM, sent you an email
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 17:11:29	My tweet about Shafik was not directed at @stevenacook . My criticism was of gap of commentary in Washington.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:07:32	@AmrGunner1 it doesn't fit their pre made narritives
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:21:46	@stevenacook @salamamoussa @AmrGunner1 spent on votes? Dear Lord in Heaven.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:23:25	@stevenacook @salamamoussa @AmrGunner1 do you actually know anything about Shafik. His people? Did you meet any of them?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:25:53	@stevenacook not sure what you are talking about?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:31:31	@stevenacook @salamamoussa @AmrGunner1 A. misquote by NYT. B. No they wldn't &amp; anyone who bothered learning bout them would have known that
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:32:06	@stevenacook @salamamoussa @AmrGunner1 How do you know, did you actually meet them?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:35:47	@stevenacook @AmrGunner1 How much did he pay me to get my vote :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:36:36	@salamamoussa @stevenacook @AmrGunner1 actually that is not the point. The question is why did he get support?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:37:12	@salamamoussa @stevenacook @AmrGunner1 those assuming it is because of NDP or being anti MB show complete ignorance on how Egyptians vote
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:37:43	@salamamoussa @stevenacook @AmrGunner1 There are no 900 liberals in Monofia let alone 900,000 to vote Shafik
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:38:24	@salamamoussa @stevenacook @AmrGunner1 My problem is that the brilliance of the Shafik campaign is missed and thus lessons not learned
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:39:25	@salamamoussa @stevenacook @AmrGunner1 there are no 12 million liberals anti MB in Egypt.Shafik got votes because of something else
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:39:46	@salamamoussa @stevenacook @AmrGunner1 if people still dont get that, then we have a problem
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:43:39	@stevenacook @AmrGunner1 @salamamoussa and you are the one to decide that for Egyptians, thousands of miles away :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:46:30	@stevenacook @AmrGunner1 @salamamoussa Again, my problem is not whether you like Shafik or not, problem is, missing why he got that support
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:48:53	Conventional wisdom is that anyone but Shafik would have beaten Morsi. Conventional wisdom is wrong. No one would have gotten even close.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:49:27	@stevenacook @AmrGunner1 @salamamoussa you actually didnt read what I said. I never said he is a liberal or that he got votes from liberals.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:49:49	@stevenacook @AmrGunner1 @salamamoussa I was actually arguing against that, in case you noticed :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-05-29 14:53:42	@stevenacook where did I misrepresent you? Couldnt reply to your message, but I am not sure what you didn't like?

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-08 18:36:30	@iaskmaie @mostafahassan89 No. It is for one church in Nubaria. What is the other one?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-11 15:44:27	@kosharipotomac @salamamoussa I didn't mean on minorities. I actually think the guy has some mental disease in the last 2-3 years.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-11 15:44:39	@kosharipotomac @salamamoussa He is not his old self at all.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-11 16:58:43	@ahmose_I I will ignore the fact that these are not the masses for the sake of the argument. Should we applaud any action by the masses?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-11 16:59:16	@ahmose_I I take it the masses burning a church is justifiable as well, or the masses lynching an accused criminal
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-11 17:00:55	@ahmose_I Thank God you are not in power :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-11 17:02:59	@ahmose_I I will ignore the fact that you wont beat them in this game. Who will your masses turn on next?

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-13 22:27:29	Jan 2011 Baradei said MB "in favor of a secular state" Today his deputy said Salafis were moderate. And some wonder why he is called a clown
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-11 13:50:21	@kosharipotomac @salamamoussa I think you take Erian too seriously. I am not sure he is very stable mentally.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-11 16:36:43	Scum beating scum. It doesn't matter which side is called Islamist and which is called revolutionary
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-11 16:54:04	@ahmose_I and beating a couple of guys in the street is getting rid of Islamists?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-11 16:54:37	@ahmose_I Do you actually think you will get rid of Islamists by beating a couple of guys?

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-17 01:33:05	@DaliaNewYork But being a Copt is not merely a religious affiliation. Its an identity.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-17 01:34:03	@sotsoy @DaliaNewYork Yes. It is not merely a religion. It is a heritage, which of course means you either choose to embrace it or you don't

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-26 18:40:06	@ahmose_I @HafsaHalawa A President would not interfere with such details. The army deployment plan is not haphazard.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-06-26 18:51:06	@ahmose_I @HafsaHalawa MB and army have a tense relationship. Lack of trust. But that does not mean anything. People should wait.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-07-10 15:29:26	@sotsoy Yes, Emad Mekky who wrote it is known to fabricate stories, so I would like to see someone investigate this.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-07-10 15:35:06	@salamamoussa @kosharipotomac @SciencePyramid Yeah, Emad Mekky is a fabricator, but the Omar Afifi part is still a scandal
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-07-10 15:35:50	The problem is not that the US supported one side or the other, the problem is that NED took Omar Afifi seriously. Pure idiocy.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-08-21 02:43:36	@SciencePyramid Well, that happens to be true
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-08-21 02:54:57	@SciencePyramid "we" don't know that. You do :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-08-21 02:59:05	@SciencePyramid Science, this is not a matter of how you feel about them. They either organized or they didn't. Mfeesh 7aga esmaha informal
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-08-21 03:06:31	@kosharipotomac @SciencePyramid Sure. MB incited, but saying MB organized is inaccurate. It was spontaneous &amp; building on local hatreds
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-08-21 03:12:32	@SciencePyramid @kosharipotomac There is nothing called MB informal. The MB is not a social network its a rigid organization.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-08-21 03:18:22	@SciencePyramid @kosharipotomac Science choose a word, you cant have it both ways. Interactions or influence? Islamists or mosques?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-08-21 03:22:56	@SciencePyramid Anyway, we can discuss elsewhere
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-08-21 06:53:17	@xtomeorg Thanks, I will let them know

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-08-29 17:41:02	@ahmose_ I dont engage conspiracy theories.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-08-29 17:50:05	@ahmose_I US media naturally reflects a variety of opinions from far right to far left. Nothing comparable to Egyptian propaganda.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-08-29 19:02:33	@ahmose_I "objective" being that they agree with you?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-08-29 19:13:51	@ahmose_I from your point of view :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-08-29 22:18:47	@ahmose_I Disagree, not on you having a brain of course :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-09-01 17:30:49	@mgyassa A few pages to finish then. Waiting to hear your comments
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-08-30 01:06:00	@melhoshy They are not contradictory choices. Big organization, some will go in each direction. Question is percentages.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-09-06 23:04:22	@hanyissac Disagree. No other candidate but Shafik could have won that many votes.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-09-06 23:09:02	@hanyissac No. Forget Cairo clowns, Shafik base would not have went to anyone else.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-09-06 23:13:49	@hanyissac Disagree. Shafik's story is the greatest misunderstood phenomenon in past 2.5 years.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-03 20:18:51	@salamamoussa @KaminskiMK Nope, Islamist awakening in universities preceded MB release from prison. It was homegrown.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-03 20:40:55	@salamamoussa @FatennMostafa @KaminskiMK timeline inaccurate, releases happened way after 71 corrective revolution
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-03 20:52:03	@salamamoussa @FatennMostafa @KaminskiMK Main source of mythology about Sadat MB is Mahmoud Game3 who fabricated stories.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-05 02:16:04	@DaliaEzzat_ Methodological, they say they are looking at 5 largest states with Arabs and in each giving percentages of Egyptians
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-05 02:31:33	@sotsoy Thats a huge diocese. So that leaves New Jersey alone, right? Between him and Michael's diocese.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-04 12:42:26	via @arabist Q: who are the most interesting, influential, or important Arab intellectuals today?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-05 01:59:44	According to NYPD report there are 291,400 Egyptians in California, Michigan, New York, Florida, and New Jersey http://t.co/5TZLxWOKY5
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-05 02:06:57	@DaliaEzzat_ Yes, also notice they cite only 5 largest states with Arabs, not same as Egyptians. Other areas have huge Egy concentrations

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-05 02:04:09	@DaliaEzzat_ Which is more striking. Higher numbers than expected.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-05 22:30:05	@basildabh the most striking ones are Coptic Americans who instead of opening their TV get their news from Al Ahram and El Watan

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-05 22:55:44	@AmrGunner1 it must have been posted near 6 october on my wall some years ago, not sure which, will try to look it up for you.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-03 20:16:59	@salamamoussa @KaminskiMK Disagree. Sadat did not create anything.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-12 19:28:02	@betsy_hiel My all time favorite is the Obama impeachment because he wasted 8 Bln to Brotherhood
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-12 19:29:02	@Nervana_1 @betsy_hiel On what exactly? The guy does not believe in conspiracy theories, he lives inside them.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-12 19:40:36	@Nervana_1 @hahellyer @betsy_hiel MB had a plan to make Sinai a terrorist principality as part of deal with Israel and US!!!!
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-12 19:52:36	@hahellyer @Nervana_1 @betsy_hiel The grand conspiracy between US, EU, Jews, MB, and Martians against Egypt http://t.co/Ho4akl3GIT
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-12 19:55:43	@hahellyer @Nervana_1 @betsy_hiel Guy believes there are secret plans to divide Egypt into 4 countries &amp; am supposed to take him seriously?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-08 23:13:28	@Ifboul I can hardly forget him. As I said in acknowledgments, my father knew him well and named me after him :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-08 23:43:49	US to suspend aid to Egypt http://t.co/AgkDDWx6ls
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-08 23:53:42	@DaliaEzzat_ @mwhanna1 what exactly are you comparing Dalia?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 18:57:07	Maspero is neither unique nor related to army or transition. It is part of hatred of Christians that has been going on for generations
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 00:03:31	If news of cutting aid true it will send shock waves in Egyptian army corridors. Destroys their imagined universe.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 00:05:29	@sotsoy Timing is striking. Yes army continues massacres but nothing compares to Rab3a.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 00:07:13	@LuneyNews No, because it's against their basic worldview. They believe Jews control the world and they appeased the Jews, so no aid cut.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 00:09:23	@cmbaraka @mwhanna1 I am sure Sisi is doing his best to make that a reality
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 00:11:36	Big question, if aid suspended, are conditions announced for resumption?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 00:13:13	@fispahani @DaliaEzzat_ Glad to be in that company :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 00:14:05	How will Sisi react? Well, he has some options, but big question for him is future of weapons not cash.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 00:51:12	Those arguing US cannot influence policy in Egypt could not be more mistaken
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 00:54:43	Likely conditioning of any suspension would be "free and fair elections" or "inclusive democratic process"
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 00:56:29	@LuneyNews No one takes this guy seriously in the region :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 00:58:36	Those who imagine Russia can replace US, good luck in a different planet. For better or worse US is irreplaceable in ME
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 01:02:26	Counter terrorism aid in Sinai likely to be continued under any suspension, that is key.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 20:27:18	@salamamoussa what Egyptian democracy?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 20:31:59	@salamamoussa :) My point is at no point since January 25th was there a chance for Egypt to become a democracy
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 01:04:48	@zaidbenjamin Key word "all"
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 01:07:59	@Ifboul Not sure they are seeing it this way. Army obviously not interested in political solution, destabilizing country.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 01:08:24	@Ifboul Worse it is engaged in worst anti american propaganda since Nasser.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 01:09:23	@Ifboul US keen on not being seen as baking coup. Doesn't want to create another Mossadegh
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 01:14:33	@salamamoussa @stevenacook @betsy_hiel @SlaughterAM You take him too seriously.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 01:17:08	@Ifboul Disagree. No one forced Mubarak out.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 01:19:31	@salamamoussa @Ifboul I am no Iran expert, but analogy will be done nonetheless
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 01:21:12	@Ifboul I tend to write what I think is true :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 01:25:14	@Ifboul Sure, did I suggest otherwise? :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 01:26:31	@salamamoussa @Ifboul On a more serious note. Mossadgh was equally a clown.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 01:49:21	Washington Post: US to announce curbs on most nonessential military aid to Egypt http://t.co/OfCMZgtSBL
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 01:51:41	One often ignored reasoning behind possible aid suspension: Upholding the nation's law
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-09 23:57:23	@EricTrager18 what influence and what strategy :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-12 06:30:39	@ElMenshawyM I know it has no base, but WT is copied from Gulf Daily News which published 27/8/2013, they even added it now on top. Check WT
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-12 18:03:14	@betsy_hiel Definition of lunacy
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-13 03:53:23	@mgyassa Much ado about nothing
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-13 04:38:37	@mgyassa Dynamics always changing, but to answer your question, No.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-13 05:14:40	@mgyassa so 5 0r 20 guys with a placard is "level of open opposition"?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-13 05:15:40	@mgyassa What happened to hundreds who demonstrated against Shenouda III in Abu Seifin MasrEl Kadima?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-13 05:16:15	@mgyassa What happened to pro Sadat laity leadership?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-13 05:16:54	@mgyassa Whether we like it or not, clergy lead Copts for a variety of entrenched reasons, this wont change soon
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-13 05:17:41	@mgyassa Some guys will demonstrate here and there, some kids will leave the church, this does not change basic structure
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-16 02:16:48	@EricTrager18 Democratic Front constituency is nonexistent. FEP constituency are Copts. This time they might go elsewhere.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-16 02:42:04	@EricTrager18 God knows. Do we even know what parties we will have?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-16 13:35:08	I never understood why people talk about Qaradawi as if he is the leader of Sunni Islam. No self respecting Salafi takes him seriously
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-14 17:45:50	@MattMcBradley @EricTrager18 @evanchill @ahauslohner @joshuahersh &amp; pro army lunatics trying to find comfort in that illusion
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-14 17:46:21	@awhawth @EricTrager18 failed states dont have coups?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-14 17:46:53	@awhawth @EricTrager18 World witnessed hundreds of coups are they result of deep state in those countries?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-14 17:47:35	So who are 2 activists who fled Egypt? http://t.co/AevkktBZnJ Wael Ghonim and ???
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-14 17:57:25	@KarlaMariaIssa So US had a deep state, every country has a deep state?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-13 18:54:59	The picture that comes out of the Sisi recordings is that of a very small man
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-13 18:57:00	Sisi is facing a real dilemma. All options are very risky for him. Adly Mansour may be his only savior.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-14 18:50:28	@melhoshy I oppose both, what does that make me :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-14 18:52:47	@patelyas @salamamoussa You think Russia can replace US?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-14 19:03:02	@stevenacook what deep state :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-14 19:05:46	@melhoshy Well I belong to an even fewer category: Those against Mubarak, 25th January &amp; 30 June :)

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-14 17:29:31	@MattMcBradley @EricTrager18 @evanchill @ahauslohner @joshuahersh There is no state in Egypt for there to be a deep one
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-14 17:30:09	@MattMcBradley @EricTrager18 @evanchill @ahauslohner @joshuahersh People take Egypt too seriously. It is just a failed state with ...

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-14 17:59:20	@KarlaMariaIssa If you believe so, not much for me to discuss then :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-14 18:18:45	There seems to be a correlation in people's minds between deep state and coup. The two are not the same.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-22 20:11:44	@MohamedElibiary Not about disagreeing. Abdel Rahman Ezz is personally involved in beating of MB opponents in Dec, and burning Wafd Party.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-22 20:14:20	@MohamedElibiary I assume you are unaware of who the man is.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-21 13:30:18	@mgyassa I am lost, how is this related to me question?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-21 14:48:38	@sotsoy I believe they said Anba Youhana who is the Bishop of the diocese
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-22 22:54:24	@MohamedElibiary nope, if you follow Egyptian politics you would know him well. Even MB tried to distance itself from him &amp; mogheer in past
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-23 00:53:36	There is delusion and then there is, um ....., this https://t.co/xwAkQosqmg by @MohamedElibiary
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-23 00:57:10	@MohamedElibiary @em_ess @BoldFreshJew Do you actually believe that? That Morsi is viewed by a portion of Egyptians as someone who can heal?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-21 19:24:46	@thejpc No. Most fall for their own conspiracy theories. They see the world through an already distorted worldview.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-23 01:02:37	@MohamedElibiary @em_ess @BoldFreshJew you can be against coup, view Morsi as Mandela for his people, but bridge to heal country?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-21 01:29:42	@mgyassa And what are those solutions?

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-22 06:22:07	@auscma @TonyRezk This is Egypt. Negligence is an art that we have perfected.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-31 00:57:02	@Mokhtar_Awad @mwhanna1 @ahmose_I @Nervana_1 My guess is that they were doing a story on Tohamy as the arch anti Islamist, which would have
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-10-31 00:57:47	@Mokhtar_Awad @mwhanna1 @ahmose_I @Nervana_1 been a good story, but they then went for the tabloid story
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-01 17:18:52	"The one entity that should be on trial is Egypt, and the leaders who remade it in the last decades." @salamamoussa  http://t.co/JtpTfyrPjr

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-01 22:10:53	@DionNissenbaum He left earlier before cancellation. Not sure its related.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-01 22:31:30	Want to accuse military &amp; MB of being fascists, sure go ahead, but remember the revolutionaries are no less fascist.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-01 22:44:03	The revolutionaries called for banning their opponents (NDP) from running for office, accepted torture of Mubarak supporters in Tahrir
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-01 22:45:13	Revolutionaries spread lies about previous regime members, villified them in media with every conspiracy theory known to man
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-01 22:46:06	Revolutionaries celebrated street violence (ultras) when it suited them and shared home addresses of their opponents
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-01 22:47:22	So please, spare us the nonsense of the angel revolutionaries against the evil MB and military

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-01 22:59:55	@MoAlexander1 Not all, which is why Burke supported the American but stood against the French
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-01 23:09:22	@elgindy_ I dont know. Never been accused of that :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-01 23:10:45	@MoAlexander1 He made a more serious argument than that :) The distinction between both revolutions is of vital importantce
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-01 23:25:00	@MoAlexander1 Yes and No. Burke was defined as a liberal before French revolution. Paine expected him to support it.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-01 23:25:57	@MoAlexander1 It is exactly the distinction he makes that creates the divide into conservative and progressive
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-01 23:26:47	@MoAlexander1 On a side note, its a breath of fresh air to find an Egyptian who actually knows who Burke is :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-01 23:30:28	@MoAlexander1 Actually it would make more sense :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-05 05:46:59	@forsoothsayer It sounds like the stories on religious sites about a convert from Christianity to Islam or the reverse
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-06 20:14:58	@EricTrager18 @ahauslohner And what exactly is a "fairly liberal Islamist politicians" is that a new species like Superman?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-10 07:55:59	@EricTrager18 @MAFouad Cant comment on that specific claim, but I agree with Fouad on the guy. Complete clown. His book is a complete joke

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-07 20:49:54	@DavidKenner @KarlreMarks Yup. Before that Egyptian newspapers were claiming she had an affair with Condi Rice
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-10 21:17:24	It is scary to realize there are scholars who actually believe the Egyptian military owns 30-40% of the economy

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-13 14:31:48	@EricTrager18 Just the racism of the Egyptian elite
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-18 19:35:39	I am actually quite curious: Why was that monument built in Tahrir in the first place? To celebrate what exactly?

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-24 05:14:40	@elgindy_ @Ikhwanweb Yeah that thing is funny. Some trends in poll make some sense though.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-24 05:17:49	Interesting poll by Zogby regarding Egypt. Some numbers make little sense, but some overall trends likely https://t.co/P1KIHRj19C

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-27 05:06:22	Revolutionaries should be asking themselves: If this happened to Bassem, would anyone care less if a crackdown begins?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-26 12:50:11	@oritperlov @MAFouad Sorry to disappoint you but God, Burke and Leo Strauss :)

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-27 15:43:50	@mwhanna1 reformists being?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-27 16:27:05	@mwhanna1 That is all true, but not what I am commenting on, I am commenting on terminology. Revolutionaries are not reformists
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-26 14:20:58	@oritperlov @MAFouad I am not sure there is anything romantic about being a conservative.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-26 14:35:37	@oritperlov @MAFouad But he is, which is why we agree on many things :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-26 19:22:25	@ahmose_I Its a Zogby poll. Like I said in other tweets, some trends there make a lot of sense.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-26 19:23:31	When looking at polling from Egypt, ignore the exact figures look for the general trends.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-26 19:26:35	Zogby poll: MB support up since May, Nour support evaporated, NSF lost badly, army support down, &amp; Baradei nonentity. All these no brainer.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-26 19:34:19	MB increase in support due to no longer being blamed for economic ills, failure of others to deliver and sympathy due to crackdown
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-26 19:35:49	Nour heavily wounded by support for coup among its base. Now only retains Da3wa Salafiya. Other Salafi mad even some small fracture in Da3wa
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-26 19:36:36	NSF was merely an umbrella for anti MB, with MB gone it returns to being meaningless. Also hurt by hate of Baradei.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-26 19:38:05	Army support naturally down. Institution no longer viewed as nationalist above politics among Islamists and their supporters.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-26 19:38:49	Finally Baradei continues to be irrelevant to any serious conversation about Egypt. He never mattered and never will
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-26 19:42:52	@manticorion @AhmedWagih Oh, it certainly isnt gone. Was commenting on people's perceptions.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-26 19:45:10	@ahmose_I I dont think its half, as I said ignore exact numbers look at trends, but to larger point, depends on what you mean by progress
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-26 19:49:03	@ahmose_I Economic progress wont happen until people start talking seriously about the economy. Not happening by Islamists or non Islamists
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-27 05:03:41	Most striking thing about Bassem Youssef being taken off the air is how no one in the country seems to care.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-27 05:04:27	People talked about Bassem Youssef being banned for 2 days, clicked on facebook group to support him and then forgot about him &amp; moved on

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-25 17:38:41	@hahellyer @EgyIndependent Lol, should have chosen a different figure :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-25 23:51:54	@MAFouad @oritperlov What's wrong with being conservative :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-28 16:13:48	@EricTrager18 Assumption being that activists are enough of a critical group to tip balance?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-29 02:41:12	@EricTrager18 Haven't things changed? I am suggesting that the scene is very different from 25 January and closer to 2005 Kefaya.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-29 02:57:09	@EricTrager18 I am not suggesting static. I am talking about size and base of revolutionary camp and hence ability to catalyze change
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-11-29 03:01:35	@EricTrager18 In January 2011 a critical segment of the middle class joined revolutionaries, that critical segment is now back to couches
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-02 15:47:39	@EricTrager18 Disagree. Massive protests still going on especially in South, very limited media coverage though

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-14 00:21:18	MB results so far in Doctor's Syndicate are quite impressive. Less than 2011 elections, but still with massive support.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-14 00:24:47	@ahmose_I Even in 2011 they did not win every seat. In 2011 for example they lost 85% of Cairo, all of Suez, half of Menya, ....
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-14 00:25:48	@ahmose_I Q is not whether MB has more than 50% of Egyptians. No one is saying that. Q is whether MB still has massive support. Answer: Yes
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-14 00:26:58	@yuyuandmarmar there are reports in most egyptian newspapers about each governate.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-14 00:29:23	@ahmose_I Highest mark was 36% in 2011 list votes.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-14 00:39:49	@ahmose_I Of course, but also gained from erosion of Nour
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-14 00:40:00	@gguemeih True
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-14 00:44:38	@ahmose_I Problem is MB support has only one way to go. Upwards. If you are not already anti MB now after all propaganda, when will you be?
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-14 00:57:47	@gguemeih Impossible to tell. Last elections was for all seats, half elections always less participation.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-14 18:03:42	Government decision to hold referendum on one stage is smart move to increase participation rate. Still, rate will be low.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-14 18:05:46	Despite crackdown and propaganda campaign, MB managed to win 32% of seats in Doctor Syndicate elections. Impressive.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-14 18:11:53	@minoushy @Nermbed @khaledmontaser @TheSecular 36 seats out of 114 contested. 35 out of 102 local seats. 1 out of 12 national seats.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-14 18:12:37	@AmrGunner1 Not really. They lost many seats in 2011 Doctor Syndicate elections.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-14 18:15:03	@Nermbed @minoushy @khaledmontaser @TheSecular Nope. my remark has nothing to do with seats not contested.
49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-14 18:17:48	@minoushy @Nermbed @khaledmontaser @TheSecular Nermeen is only counting the national seats. I am counting all seats.

49438467	Samueltadros	2013-12-24 19:38:31	@valecolombo64 Most if not all attacks on Copts are result of perception that Copts forgot their rightful place as second class citizens

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-01-12 22:19:25	@mwhanna1 polarization is too strong and blood too much for such a calculation. Emotions will drive MB voters.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-01-12 22:26:11	@gguemeih They can't. No leadership capable of taking such a decision today, and supporters wont follow such an order
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-01-12 22:36:27	For those looking at expat votes, participation rate will vary according to percentage of Christians in each expat community.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-01-12 22:37:28	Best model to compare expat votes is non Islamist votes in Presidential elections. Add up Shafik, Moussa, Sabahy votes and compare to today
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-01-12 22:41:18	Here are the official number of registered in each country (Notice 100,000) more registered than 2012, https://t.co/m6s74qAZoG
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-01-12 22:43:54	@mwhanna1 True, but also 15% more registration after coup.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-01-12 22:53:09	@ahmose_I @mwhanna1 Not sure about 70% figure. Yes lots of Egyptians in Toronto wont vote, but you have a consulate in Montreal
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-01-12 23:17:35	@awhawth @EricTrager18 @nancyayoussef Expat votes is much harder to forge.

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-01-12 20:46:05	@EricTrager18 Once voting is done it will be around 20% participation.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-01-12 22:04:07	I am not following this like I used to but here is a guess: Participation: 18-22 million. Approval 95%
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-01-12 22:12:10	@gguemeih MB will boycott
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-01-12 22:01:53	@EricTrager18 @nancyayoussef It will be a bit higher than that
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-01-12 22:12:42	@mwhanna1 As I said, I am not closely following, but approval will be extremely high.

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-03-28 18:35:00	Copts are not targeted because of mixing of religion and politics, they are targeted because they are Copts.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-03-28 18:38:04	Physical attacks on Copts did not decline under Morsi.

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-03-28 18:49:02	@AmrGunner1 What do you mean dominate FM. The guy was never appointed Minister. He inherited him from Sadat and kept him in same post
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-03-28 18:50:00	@AmrGunner1 I am not suggesting Mubarak was anti Coptic. But he did not favor them.

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-03-28 19:03:13	@AmrGunner1 I am still missing your point. You said "too many Coptic governors". One Coptic governor in 30 years is too many?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-03-28 19:04:21	@AmrGunner1 Mounir Fakhry Abdel Nour was an opposition politician, Mubarak privileged him how exactly?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-03-28 19:04:38	@AmrGunner1 And who is Fahmy Mikhail?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-03-28 19:08:28	@IsisAkhnaton There are no church figures. There are diocese estimates. Huge difference.

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-03-28 19:30:20	@Ziya_Meral @L_Hussein Depends on how we define attacks. Certainly Copts were attacked during Mamluk and Ottoman rule. Mamluk was worst time

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-01 17:13:23	New article by @shadihamid offers a number of points worth discussing http://t.co/NaG2oeNyO9
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-01 17:14:05	1. Let me start by saying that I find comparative politics a weak tool in understanding much of what has been going on in Egypt past 3 years
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-01 17:15:19	2. So using Polity IV Index as a form of measurement is for me the weakest part of the argument
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-01 17:16:19	3. Question of whether Morsi was an autocrat or a democrat offers a binary choice and depends on how we define both.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-01 17:19:00	5. Existence of popular discontent with measures taken by Morsi is no indication of nature of his rule.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-01 17:23:41	8. There was nothing ordinary about what was happening and by using the word transition a future course is being suggested with no evidence.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-01 17:25:40	9. Egypt of course not transitioning to anything resembling a real democracy today under military but neither was it at any point since rev
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-01 17:32:55	11. MB constiution was much worse than just "deeply flowed &amp; Illiberal". I analyzed it here http://t.co/0AjOwOlQLb &amp; http://t.co/hws1eq29sr
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-01 17:35:31	12. Argument that opposition could organize protests &amp; through media ignores that protests were attacked in Dec &amp; threats against media
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-03 02:29:38	@Max_Fisher @Amir_G_Beshay I dont know of any Copt who identifies as Arab. Unlike Levant Christians, Copts never warmed to idea.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-03 02:35:57	Mubarak interview another indication of how deeply rooted Anti Semitism is in Egypt http://t.co/uLo99rVWxh

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-01 17:07:53	@salamamoussa Just the one post June 2012?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-01 17:17:42	4. We must also acknowledge limitations of time. 1 year is simply not enough to judge a system in one direction or other
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-01 17:20:22	6. The fact that Morsi was constrained by MB incompetency and lack of institutional support by state bodies tells us little of the man.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-01 17:22:56	7. Arguing that Egypt under Morsi was undergoing a "remarkably ordinary transition" is however quite problematic
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-01 17:29:07	10. Right to point out that MB did not hijack political process, but that tells us little about that political process. Was it good or bad?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-04-01 17:37:37	13. Evidence on MB autocratic nature is not thin. For an assessment of MB weakness and one year in power check http://t.co/ovB1VpVQLW

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-05 00:04:14	@ZiadAsali and the reason you believe the story is?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-03 12:26:31	@elgindy_ interesting family name
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-02 20:34:26	An excellent article by @stevenacook http://t.co/Sqaw6kyuNT
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-02 23:11:45	@salamamoussa no. They don't care less about Christians in the first place
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-03 23:43:24	@MattMcBradley @salamamoussa the military did not take the clown off the air
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-03 22:40:04	@EricTrager18 how the times have changed
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 00:50:12	I will be tweeting some shocking numbers about the size of religious schools under Al Azhar in Egypt
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 00:50:44	1. Religious schools students represent 7.^% of all pre-school students in Egypt
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 00:51:14	2. Religious schools students represent 11.4% of primary school students in Egypt.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 00:51:37	3. Religious schools students represent 9.7% of all middle school students in Egypt.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 00:52:07	4. Religious schools students represent 11.7% of all high school students in Egypt.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 00:52:44	5. Excluding technical high schools, religious schools students represent 24.3% of all high school students in Egypt.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 00:53:21	6. Excluding technical schools, religious schools represent 45% of all schools in Egypt.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 00:54:00	7. Al Azhar University is the largest university in Egypt, larger than even Cairo and represents 17% of all university students in Egypt.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 01:10:20	8. 27% of Egyptians in their 20's did not complete primary education. 17% dropped out of school while 10% never enrolled in the first place
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-06 17:09:24	Sisi is not the maker of Egypt's statist discourse but its natural outcome. This statism transcends not only him but even Nasser.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-06 17:10:12	But his dilemma is that while he believes that the state should dominate everything, and that there is no public sphere separate from it
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-06 17:11:28	hat everyone and everything from individual to civil society, media, business should work in complete harmony to serve Egypts best interests
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-06 17:13:22	Sisi actually has no idea what that best interest is outside of its means.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-06 17:13:47	Sisi &amp; Egypt's dilemma is that his totalitarianism has no substance. It will be totalitarianism for the sake of totalitarianism
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 02:46:48	Election experts, time to lay down your numbers: Turnout and percentage. @Sarhan_ @MAFouad @AmrGunner1 @M_ibr
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 02:47:46	Egypt experts, time for the numbers game: Turnout and percentage @EricTrager18 @mwhanna1 @masoudtarek @stevenacook
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-09 13:11:55	@oritperlov @Sarhan_ @MAFouad @AmrGunner1 @M_ibr many rev will vote Sabahi, Others will boycott but they represent 2-3% of voters
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 13:11:38	@Hragy @MoAlexander1 @oritperlov Lol, whatever
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 13:14:30	@Deutschdoc @Sonia_Dridi I would argue that the more exposed you are to EG education the more likely you are to become a conspiracy theorist
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 13:17:04	@oritperlov Numbers issued by Central Auditing Organization and available in slides here http://t.co/dCjE23Tyjo
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 13:19:41	@arabist Central Auditing Authority available here http://t.co/dCjE23Tyjo with exception of last number which was in newspapers

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 19:06:56	@MAFouad @Sarhan_ @AmrGunner1 @M_ibr so you are basically saying it will be exactly like referendum
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 19:50:42	@Sarhan_ @MAFouad @AmrGunner1 @Nervana_1 A couple of points. 1. Elections over people usually gets more than over meaningless documents
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 19:51:23	@Sarhan_ @MAFouad @AmrGunner1 @Nervana_1 2. Sisi's campaign however has serious issues. Cannot be compared to the superb Shafik team
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 19:52:11	@Sarhan_ @MAFouad @AmrGunner1 @Nervana_1 3. To say like Fouad does that it is exactly like referendum might be true, but it would be the
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 19:52:48	@Sarhan_ @MAFouad @AmrGunner1 @Nervana_1 worst possible reflection on a country that is thus completely stagnant
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 19:53:33	@Sarhan_ @MAFouad @AmrGunner1 @Nervana_1 4. Sabahi faced uphill battle to get signatures, has a weak campaign, limited finances
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 19:53:59	@Sarhan_ @MAFouad @AmrGunner1 @Nervana_1 5. however his greatest problem in my view is that he has no base. No polarized segment to stand on
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 19:54:26	@Sarhan_ @MAFouad @AmrGunner1 @Nervana_1 He is pro 30 June but not enough, pro 25 Janu but also pro 30 June
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 19:54:52	@Sarhan_ @MAFouad @AmrGunner1 @Nervana_1 worse for him his challenger has inroads within the same base: Nasserism
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-07 19:55:34	@Sarhan_ @MAFouad @AmrGunner1 @Nervana_1 He can only become the Amr Moussa or Aboul Fetouh of this election, سنحيا في أي ناحية
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-09 20:06:58	Next Friday come watch @Mokhtar_Awad @LeeSmithTWS and myself discuss Egypt after Sisi's elections http://t.co/M5U0ABr6gv

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-25 22:29:57	The MB is not alone in its anti Coptic hatred &amp; incitement, but the organization and that rhetoric are inseparable https://t.co/sfMttnYUxX
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-25 18:53:12	Whoever forged this to incite against Copts, needs to learn a few things about them before his next forgery https://t.co/ZGVgzIBawE
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 05:53:00	@3aliyon I said forged. Not done by church
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 00:41:11	@salamamoussa @Ziya_Meral @Nervana_1 come on, Banna invented nothing. He just copied liberal constitutionalists
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 01:04:21	@salamamoussa @Ziya_Meral @Nervana_1 not so sure about that
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 01:07:35	@salamamoussa @Ziya_Meral @Nervana_1 In all cases nothing beats Sheikh Gawish in 1908
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 01:14:40	@salamamoussa @Ziya_Meral @Nervana_1 Yup, striking that no one came with any new anti Coptic argument since Lutfi El Sayed
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 01:19:08	@AmrGunner1 @ddknyt Only half so, the part about Sisi pre 2011 shows David knows very little about Egypt
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-25 11:12:01	@Sarhan_ Thank you ya bieh
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-25 11:12:12	@EricTrager18 Thanks Eric
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 14:34:25	My guess, and I am not following at all, is 42-45% participation rate, 92-95% Sisi victory
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 13:39:07	@AbuWasan2013 @3aliyon They did. Whoever forged this doesnt know anything about Copts. Orthodox dont use the terms used in this banner.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 19:10:17	Its one thing to argue that Islamist illiberalism is widely supported by Egyptian population, it is entirely different to justify it
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 19:10:55	It is one thing to argue that Sisi's repression is widely supported it is entirely different to justify it and support it
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 19:13:41	To support current regime because it is the least ugly possibility is quite different than supporting it because you see it as beautiful
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 19:26:22	If Egypt is to move forward it needs to find peace with itself. It needs to accept that diversity is a source of strength not a weakness
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 16:39:12	People searching for MB's greatest mistake often point out to decision to run for president. Wrong. It was firing Tantawi.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 19:12:01	Sisi's repression of Islamists and of freedoms may be natural outcome of Egyptian politics in past 3 years, that doesnt make it good
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 19:23:02	@AhmedWagih Natural yes, but also the result of human choices. Choices by all political forces in Egypt
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-26 19:25:18	Mob choices to repress the other be them old regime, Islamists, or revolutionaries are equally reprehensible
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 06:54:44	@baqdunis @liamstack @salamamoussa incorrect. Copts in committee voted yes, only no vote was Fahmy Qaliny
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 06:58:08	@baqdunis @liamstack @salamamoussa  it was also supported by Orthodox Milli Council and Protestant Milli Council
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 08:19:54	@Nervana_1 a few points above referendum
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 08:01:26	@Mokhtar_Awad way less, only 7 million voted in 2005
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 08:03:17	@awhawth @Mokhtar_Awad I understood the tweet as making fun of the notion of a deep state in the first place
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 03:42:42	@evanchill God bless you. Only thing I can offer is honorary Egyptian citizenship :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 03:50:58	@evanchill how is your Arabic? https://t.co/FPXbYFXTyM
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 04:15:45	@evanchill Of course. That is expected, people are voting for humans this time not an abstract document that is meaningless to them
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 04:16:10	@evanchill Question is if there are unnatural increases that defy logic in some governates
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 05:42:44	@HafsaHalawa @evanchill surprise to who exactly? People who know elections in Egypt have been predicting in this range
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 05:47:24	@HafsaHalawa @evanchill No offence intended, but maybe you should follow closer. @MAFouad and @Sarhan_ predicted these results weeks ago
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 05:48:24	@HafsaHalawa @evanchill 47% a bit higher than my own prediction 42-45% but still reasonable given third voting day
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 05:48:51	@HafsaHalawa @evanchill for a serious assessment of results, we will have to look at them by polling station
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 05:53:55	@evanchill @EricTrager18 @HafsaHalawa @SteveNegusMasr There will be instances of forging in certain stations, this happened in referendum
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 05:54:20	@evanchill @EricTrager18 @HafsaHalawa @SteveNegusMasr In girga for example 5,000 voted were forged in 6 polling stations in a city
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 05:54:43	@evanchill @EricTrager18 @HafsaHalawa @SteveNegusMasr but all those cases in referendum did not exceed 20,000 votes
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 10:22:07	Free Egyptians Party seems to think Banha is a governate. Lord have Mercy https://t.co/etNBQC3wmS

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 12:04:25	@salamamoussa @baqdunis @liamstack 4 Coptic members only one no and he did so after pressure from King
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 12:35:15	@PeterTadrosAU @salamamoussa choices more complex and individual, include conversion, assimilation, and Dhimmitude
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 14:26:09	Apparently City Stars Mall has been closed to allow workers to vote :) http://t.co/5BR1a3ngxL
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 14:28:52	Sisi raised the bar for himself by speaking of 40 million voters, &amp; continued mythology of imagined 33 million who went out on 30/6 hurt him
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 14:29:36	Sisi did not view this as a campaign in which he needs to win people's votes. The people are the ones who needed to win him.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 14:30:39	For second time in two years, the Amr Moussa electoral machine has managed to hurt their candidate. Remarkable that anyone hires these guys
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 14:31:07	@SameralAtrush well, he chose them
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 14:40:34	Sisi's behavior during the campaign points to his greatest challenge: mobilization with organization just as Nasser
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 14:42:02	Sisi should have learned something from 2012 elections where the two men who made it to round 2 where the ones with best organization
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 14:44:19	Everyone is wondering how Egyptians will be disappointed in Sisi, flip side is how they will disappoint him :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 14:44:57	Sisi comes to presidency with worldview built on his years in army, where soldiers follow orders. Now he is about to meet planet Egypt
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 14:45:48	If Sisi imagines that the bureaucracy will change its behavior just for him, well time for him to learn how ungovernable Egypt actually is
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:33:13	The mass hysteria surrounding participation rate is a good reminder that in Egypt perception is more important than reality
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:39:48	At a point in not so distant future, Sisi will be echoing East German Communist Party in 1953: people have lost government's confidence
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:46:02	@ablasalma "we" will see :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:48:26	@ablasalma as in those are the results that will be announced
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:49:12	@ablasalma If you want to follow someone who actually knows what he is talking about regarding elections @MAFouad
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:50:57	@ablasalma In referendum for example you had rigging in 7 stations in Girga with 5,000 votes added
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:52:15	@ablasalma @MAFouad Ok, this is obviously not getting through, take a break, have a kitkat, reread my tweet :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:55:52	@ablasalma sorry if you are offended, I was trying to joke. You totally misunderstood what I was saying.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:57:31	@tariksalama @MAFouad I am not a kind guy. I have a lot of work in that area ahead of me to improve
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 18:08:08	The people have lost the confidence of the government; the government has decided to dissolve the people, and to elect another one (Brecht)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 19:13:15	@masoudtarek @mwhanna1 on what basis are you saying this?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 19:18:29	@masoudtarek @mwhanna1 This is only thing I saw https://t.co/pBH6qvrsGz, this sounds reasonable. 19.943 million
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 19:24:49	@SameralAtrush sounds reasonable
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 19:37:24	@mwhanna1 Vanity, always my favorite sin
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 19:38:45	People wondering why Sisi wants phenomenal number miss the point of this electoral circus. It is about image of unified nation
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 19:40:19	Sisi seeks narrative of unified nation behind glorious leader. That narrative most important thing for him to crush all dissent
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 19:42:13	Mubarak could accept having 7 million vote for him in 2005, Sisi cannot. Thats why describing Sisi as reincarnation of Mubarak is ridiculous
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 19:42:57	Sisi does not seek to build an authoritarian state, he seeks a totalitarian model, a model where no public sphere is outside state control
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 19:44:43	@AhmedWagih I am not saying he does.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 19:47:49	@patelyas everything the man has said and done :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 19:50:37	@TheSecular read my tweets again. I said 20+ have voted
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 20:08:33	Outside of the Nour Party, who is actually mobilizing for Sisi on the ground?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 22:48:35	Sisi has only himself and his joke of a campaign to blame for low turnout narrative becoming reality in people's minds
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 23:10:02	For one who's about to become president, Sisi has proven to be completely incompetent at most basic task, managing own ascent to presidency
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 14:27:04	The elections have proven that Sisi's greatest enemy is himself
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 14:33:37	The participation rate is actually not as disastrous as people make it to be on twitter, but Sisi dug his own grave
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 14:41:30	Nasser before him failed to build a vehicle between leader &amp; masses. Sisi imagined that voters will just go out and vote on their own
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:34:29	Despite twitter meltdown, participation rate is actually not bad, but Sisi's ego accepts nothing less than historical records
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:36:02	@tariksalama the best source and expert in the world is @MAFouad
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:37:27	Election fiasco a good indicator of Sisi's worldview. He expects things to happen, just like that, be it people voting, working, or anything
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:40:34	Brecht famously remarked if it wouldn't be easier for government to dissolve the people and elect another
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:41:25	@ablasalma Nope, we are getting 20+ million already. Its now just a matter of the man's ego
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:48:11	@ablasalma You still dont understand the first tweet. There is no "we", just a general "we" as in all Egyptians will see those results
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 17:50:27	@ablasalma there is no rigging, at least nothing that will affect results. There will be small forging like all other elections in Egypt
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 19:18:59	@masoudtarek @mwhanna1 that is not lower than March 2011

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 19:32:08	@MicheleDDunne @adammowafi @Nervana_1 @salamamoussa We may not like the results, but they are real results. Election experts confirm them.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 19:42:07	@evanchill Monofeya needs no explanation. Look at votes it gave Shafik. Kafr El Sheikh with 1.2 mil makes little sense, Watan # realistic
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 19:43:30	Good article by @minafayek on why Sisi may not be good for Copts http://t.co/Y7WKGAr63Q
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 19:56:47	I was interviewed by @ForewordReviews on my new book: Reflections on the Revolution in Egypt http://t.co/XvnKEdVAdH
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 21:10:19	@baqdunis @salamamoussa Glad you read it, hope to hear your comments and criticism. Which part do you want reference for?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 21:11:42	@baqdunis @salamamoussa For Qaliny's role and change of position due to meeting with King Fouad he discusses in his memoirs p.32-35
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 21:14:29	@baqdunis @salamamoussa For position of Elias Awad, Metropolitan Youannes &amp; Councils check Tarik El Beshry book on Muslims &amp; Copts p.175-185
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 21:16:49	@baqdunis @salamamoussa most striking aspect in Beshry is that he puts the facts there, yet they are lost in his nationalist narrative
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 21:25:04	@baqdunis p. 175, Elias Awad joined Tawfik Doss, p. 176 on Youannes and Youssef Qattawi Pasha, p.177 on Elias Awad arguments
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 21:26:10	@baqdunis p. 185 on Youannes, Coptic Orthodox and Protestant Milli Councils and 4 Bishops telegrams plus Pope position
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 21:27:07	@baqdunis Yes, Muslims and Copts
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 21:28:13	@baqdunis I should add, I am strongly against quota system and my great uncle Aziz Mirhom led the charge against it
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 21:40:07	@salamamoussa @baqdunis Yes p.138 mentions Orthodox Milli Council position &amp; 4 Bishops, says Pope supported but I found her words too strong
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 21:43:31	Analysts &amp; experts on Egypt should grow up and differentiate between their personal preferences and facts on the ground
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 21:44:50	Elections were conducted in undemocratic climate but that does not mean votes were forged. Participation rate real and so is Sisi margin
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 23:16:22	@EricTrager18 yes, in referendum 1,226,154
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 23:20:11	@EricTrager18 Voter turnout higher when there are actual people on the ballot. It will be even higher in parliament
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 23:20:31	@EricTrager18 and yes comparison should be to referendum
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 23:24:26	@M_ibr source?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 23:29:02	@M_ibr ok, makes more sense. Total participation would have been ridiculous for Kafr El Sheikh
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-28 23:48:43	@JacksonDiehl what disastrous turnout?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 00:02:26	@Farid_Senzai @JacksonDiehl Nothing new here. Voter turnout is within expected numbers
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 00:04:49	@Farid_Senzai @JacksonDiehl Reports on the ground from "actual election experts" point to an expected participation rate 42-45% as predicted
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 00:29:09	@Farid_Senzai @Ferjani9arwi @JacksonDiehl Of course we can. Actual election experts have people on the ground and know districts
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 00:29:52	@Farid_Senzai @Ferjani9arwi @JacksonDiehl Our dislike for Sisi is one thing, this blinding us to actual facts on the ground is another
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 00:36:25	@Ferjani9arwi @Farid_Senzai @JacksonDiehl Real experts on Egyptian elections are @MAFouad @Sarhan_ @M_ibr @AmrGunner1
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 22:44:00	Good report by @MattMcBradley on role of media http://t.co/wgibFv5sr9 only drawback is missing Jacobin rhetoric against anyone not pro rev
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-27 19:26:23	@masoudtarek @mwhanna1 source I posted says 37%. Results are exactly as expected, same range as referendum
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 00:58:52	@Farid_Senzai @JacksonDiehl Tells you how much he actually knows about Egyptian elections :)

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 02:14:45	@elgindy_ serious. Their report is a joke.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-29 02:15:37	@awhawth @Mokhtar_Awad @evanchill We have 3 different tallies, Youm 7 seems most realistic http://t.co/rI7R11p2yT http://t.co/QmBrPRsj6y

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-05-30 11:57:54	@salamamoussa @MohamedHawary Rushdi would disagree, he said Baz was an idiot

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 17:33:17	@jebusite1 @salamamoussa ouch, what is worse than being called a realist :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 17:58:33	@jebusite1 Are these the only two choices? :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 19:09:15	@jebusite1 I call myself an old Whig :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 10:17:02	National Council for Women continues to live in parallal universe claiming no sexual harassment took place on 30 June http://t.co/YHV1lVPVEM
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 19:18:45	@jebusite1 I wouldn't say so. The man who last described himself as an Old Whig was Hayek. Burke and Wilberforce were both contemporaries.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 19:34:05	@jebusite1 I am certainly no isolationist, but I am skeptic about radical change (Burke's argument).
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 22:08:17	Islamists seem to like us guys @mwhanna1 @hahellyer https://t.co/xQdOApddnn
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 11:14:46	@spicksandspecks @PeterGreste @RenaNetjes @sueturtonaje fact that someone is falsely accused of a crime doesnt make him a good journalist
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-12 19:13:02	@salamamoussa I am struggling to find your two sides in a battle between tolerance and bigotry anywhere in the region
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-12 19:17:39	For all the polemics about the lessons of Iraq for Egypt, I am actually struggling to find any similarity between both countries
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-12 19:26:47	@Ferjani9arwi Really? I am of course all for inclusion, but many groups around the world excluded and shit didnt happen
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-12 19:27:10	@Ferjani9arwi I side with Edmund Burke, its all about the circumstances. No grand theory here.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-12 20:09:25	@Ferjani9arwi People will read in Iraq what they already believe. Those who blame Obama, will blame him, those who blame Bush will blame him
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-12 20:09:56	@Ferjani9arwi those who support sisi will tell you this is what he saved egypt from, those who argue for inclusive politics will argue for
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-12 20:10:29	@Ferjani9arwi isolationists will say to hell with them, and others will say its all about Islam
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 16:41:41	Apparently Egypt has a "right wing secular nationalism", who knew! http://t.co/uvEtM476mU @Max_Fisher
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 16:53:04	One can reject conspiracy theories about foreign reporters and defend freedom of speech while pointing out their own conspiracy theories
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 16:54:27	Foreign reporters right to complain about madness against them, but its also true that some of them believe conspiracy theories about Egypt
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 16:59:01	Planet Netjes @RenaNetjes : "old regime had a hand in Alex church bombing" https://t.co/ntLL4NMAKz you actually believe that Rena?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 17:02:57	Rena Netjes @RenaNetjes believes papal candidates are all state security candidates https://t.co/UZ6eYCbLdg
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 17:03:40	@RenaNetjes you can do better than that, your question was about them voting after facts you stated about Maspero and Alex
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 17:06:25	@RenaNetjes well, since you decided to respond, lets have some fun here
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 17:08:04	According to @RenaNetjes the Coptic Church calls each family to tell them whom to vote for https://t.co/0peniBHxRW
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 17:09:51	Rena @RenaNetjes doesnt believe Coptic Papal elections did not involve instructions on whom to vote for https://t.co/ttH3x3GECS

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 17:12:15	Coptic Pope has sold justice to power according to @RenaNetjes https://t.co/U7yiEgiHIK
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 17:13:21	Apparently Pope Shenouda was not authentic enough for @RenaNetjes https://t.co/H0cbyrNSNf
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 17:27:39	@letmehaveitall @RenaNetjes sarcastic? There is evidence papal candidates are chosen by state security?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 17:28:02	@letmehaveitall @RenaNetjes there is evidence Alex Church bombing done by Mubarak?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 17:31:14	@letmehaveitall ok, my bad :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 17:36:23	@letmehaveitall Yes, there is fine line betw standing against intimidation of journalists in Egypt and pointing out bad journalism &amp; bias
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 21:36:34	@kosharipotomac @RenaNetjes @patelyas and did they also tell you candidates for pope were chosen by state security, lol
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-10 21:49:39	@patelyas In Planet Rena they do
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-12 20:15:15	@Ferjani9arwi which maps? Are these countries real ones? Are they comparable to Egypt?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-12 20:22:31	@Ferjani9arwi I am not saying it is isolated, i am saying those comparing between Egypt and Iraq (mainly Sisi lovers) are mistaken
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-12 20:30:25	@Ferjani9arwi we can certainly agree on that
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-13 15:25:30	@currentaff @salamamoussa do you have an example in mind?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-13 17:33:50	@currentaff @salamamoussa but that's not tolerance, that is controlling hatred through repression, when those regimes fall, and they
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-13 17:34:12	@currentaff @salamamoussa eventually do, it is more ugly
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-13 18:37:56	Second excerpt from my book. In this part I offer my criticism for democracy promotion efforts under President Bush http://t.co/l0A7NLApPS
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 02:14:52	Excerpt from my new book: Reflections on the Revolution in Egypt published by @ABCReligion http://t.co/wdFPQDW3Ev
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 07:34:50	@minafayek @ABCReligion I am afraid hope is not my trade :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 07:35:47	@minafayek I hardly see eye to eye with Amr Ezzat on anything, in general this is an excerpt, full argument in book
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 08:42:04	Oh come on
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 10:35:32	@SteveNegusMasr Thanks :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 10:56:44	@patelyas Thanks Patrick
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 10:57:13	@SameralAtrush Thanks
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 11:03:07	@AhmedWagih @tekaldas @SteveNegusMasr Great discussion, but I didnt use that term in the first place :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 11:06:43	@tekaldas @SteveNegusMasr @AhmedWagih There is enough in the excerpt let alone the book already for people to hate :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 11:10:41	@forsoothsayer Well that's a start, at least we agree on some things :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 11:12:19	@HASSanKHALED1 Thank you
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 11:43:47	@forsoothsayer Well, I obviously disagree. Egyptians are not from Mars. They are just like every other people around the world.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 11:44:43	@forsoothsayer My book, as its title suggests, is written from an ideological point of view, its a conservative critique of revolution
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 11:45:13	@forsoothsayer modeled on that of Edmund Burke's of the French. Naturally you will find a lot in the excerpt and book to disagree with
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-11 11:47:55	@forsoothsayer I offered my suggestions in March 2011 http://t.co/lVQKq11JzQ

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-19 22:09:33	@EricTrager18 @John_Hudson @mike_giglio Though Oriental &amp; Eastern Orthodox disagree on number of issues, fact that its Orth attracts Copts

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-22 21:38:51	Today the world lost one of the greatest scholars of the Middle East. I lost my mentor and friend. Rest in Peace Fouad Ajami
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-22 21:52:56	The world will mourn a great intellectual and brilliant author. I will mourn a man I called my Mo'allem. RIP Fouad Ajami
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-22 22:32:53	Fouad Ajami was at home in US. He loved it deeply, but he never stopped loving the ME. For all the pains it gave him, he still loved it
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-22 22:33:25	@Nael_Shama Yes, he was truly a gentleman
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-22 22:56:38	Obituaries will be written mourning the loss of a scholar, but I will remember the man who took a student seeking advice on PhD as his son.

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-26 16:44:04	@FaisalAlYafai @iMakary Thanks, people would naturally disagree on interpreting anyone's legacy. One thing I take issue with is Fouad's (1)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-26 16:44:51	@FaisalAlYafai @iMakary alleged remark about Said's death. I found no source for that. I know for a fact that this is not how he felt (2)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-26 16:45:27	@FaisalAlYafai @iMakary We discussed Said's death and it saddened him deeply that they never made peace before Said's death

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-27 14:44:31	@hahussain @EricTrager18 And you see that as an argument that only a conservative can understand the Arab predicament ?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-27 14:54:03	@hahussain @EricTrager18 No, that line is about my personal relationship with my mentor. I am not arguing anything there :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-27 15:01:28	@hahussain by the way did you ever write an article after the fall of Baghdad telling Arab supporters of saddam: ezhabo fa antom tolaka2?
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-06-27 15:37:44	@hahussain I somehow remember it was you. That article changed my life. It compared Iraq to Christ using poetic language about Iraq's pain

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-07-17 21:08:02	@rcadyn @StCharlesInst Of course MB incites against Copts. But that has nothing to do with incident which I mentioned in article

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-07-21 06:28:25	@maggieogs @salamamoussa @auscma The big elephant in the room is what Coptic means in the first place. Is it equal to egyptian?

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-07-21 07:16:34	@patelyas @maggieogs @salamamoussa @auscma Exactly, you dont have a separate Coptic one outside of the church
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-07-21 07:17:49	@patelyas @maggieogs @salamamoussa @auscma not really, but that is not what we are discussing anyway
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-07-21 07:18:48	@patelyas @maggieogs @salamamoussa @auscma The problem with Egypt and the region as a whole is that identity is viewed as either or

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-07-21 07:21:39	@patelyas @maggieogs @salamamoussa @auscma maybe you dont know enough Copts :)

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-07-21 16:04:30	@TonyRezk @auscma @maggieogs @salamamoussa Coptic language served its purpose when it existed as do all languages, now it has no role

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-09-25 19:14:50	@Ferjani9arwi @EricTrager18 @rulajebreal By any standard. MB since its inception has gone beyond differences among Islamic sects
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-09-25 19:15:06	@Ferjani9arwi @EricTrager18 @rulajebreal which is one of the reasons Salafis criticize the MB

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-10-14 20:11:19	@DioscorusBoles @salamamoussa Not really. Arab nationalism in Levant was first an anti Ottoman discourse. In Lebanon Sunni domination
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-10-14 20:11:49	@DioscorusBoles @salamamoussa In Iraq the same, in Syria minority rule. In Egypt, Egyptian control of Arabs
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-10-14 20:12:37	@DioscorusBoles @salamamoussa as to Egyptian nationalism, I have no idea what that is.

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-10-22 21:48:16	@MohamedElibiary Of course MB represents real constituency. As to winning elections NO. This is just an excuse by Minister to delay election
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-10-22 22:17:31	@MohamedElibiary Claims of end of Islamism are nonsense. Here is my take on them http://t.co/DJMkpgUhuu But MB would not win elections.

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-10-22 22:30:46	@MohamedElibiary Organization hardly resilient. Collapsed under much weaker crackdown by Nasser. Second birth in late 70's not continuation
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-10-22 22:31:21	@MohamedElibiary and who said anything about liberals. There are few liberals in Egypt.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-10-22 22:32:15	@MohamedElibiary Competitor to MB is not some imagined liberals, but family networks that have always represented districts
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-10-22 22:43:54	@MohamedElibiary I am sure Yasser Burhami would appreciate being called Liberal :)

49438467	Samueltadros	2014-11-04 17:35:55	@MarinaKilada I still dont understand the first question.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-11-04 17:36:31	@MarinaKilada Christians were of course both represented in the officer corps and more so among the conscripts.
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-11-04 17:37:02	@MarinaKilada In the latter case this was heavily due to conscription of uni grads after 1967
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-11-04 17:37:55	@MarinaKilada Though not related, a fierce debate broke out among first Jihadi cell in Egypt over whether those who died in 73 were martyrs
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-11-04 17:38:50	@MarinaKilada some argued that they were fighting Jews, so they are martyrs regardless of the regime being infidel, while others said no
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-11-04 17:39:17	@MarinaKilada they were serving an infidel army and thus died an unbelievers death
49438467	Samueltadros	2014-11-04 17:40:02	@MarinaKilada Watani newspaper usually publishes such profiles on 6 october every year. I dont know of academic study

49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-05 14:02:43	@ahmose_I isn't the comparison to Gaddafi telling?
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-05 14:19:12	@ahmose_I you ever listened to the leaks from his AMAY interview about his dreams?
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-06 12:45:58	@Nervana_1 I am not basing it just on the dreams :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-05 00:31:24	Quite funny how many people are trying to analyze Sisi's speech in Al Azhar. I assume some equally attempted to analyze Gaddafi's Green Book
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 01:07:13	@Nervana_1 huh? which Islamists exactly would have wanted Morsi to go to cathedral?
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 01:09:47	1. Sisi's visit to Cathedral nice symbolic move, though following others like Gamal Mubarak and Morsi it is Christmas not Easter
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 01:10:42	2. Copts will be happy but nothing changes for them. Discrimination and persecution continues.
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 01:11:53	3. Important to note Sisi did not stay and attend Mass, similar to Morsi in 2012 when MB highlighted that fact
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 01:14:42	4. Sisi decision not to respect liturgy &amp; give talk disturbing but prob unintentional. Like nearly all Egy Muslims he has no idea what it is
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 01:16:12	5. Visit unprepared. Pope thought Sisi will sit, gave him his back but found him coming up on altar entrance
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 01:16:53	6. Hard to blame Pope for allowing Sisi to speak, couldn't have stopped him
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 01:18:19	@awhawth looking forward to hearing your comments and criticisms
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 01:20:14	7. Though nothing changes in Coptic plight, Sisi visit extremely important for them. Makes them feel equal Egyptians even if just for a day
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 01:21:49	@sotsoy yeah, truly disturbing but I seriously doubt he had a clue
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 01:22:09	@sotsoy and a very merry Christmas to you too
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 01:24:20	@sotsoy God forgive the one who started the practice of thanking officials, clapping and greeting them during liturgy
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 01:25:11	@sotsoy on the other hand, I have low expectations, thank God they didn't sing eb'oro when he entered
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 02:05:23	@ZiadAsali step or just rhetoric, only time will tell
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 04:26:29	@annmarlowe @batchelorshow @juleslalaland he is also leading heaviest crackdown on civil society in Egypt's history
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 04:28:56	@Nervana_1 I disagree . Morsi didn't do it because he and his base theologically find idea repulsive
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 04:30:43	@juleslalaland @annmarlowe @batchelorshow if you are referring to speech then this is over reading. Nothing will happen
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 04:35:23	@juleslalaland @annmarlowe @batchelorshow if anyone expected that from Obama he needed to have his head checked
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-07 18:07:17	@markmovsesian one thing to note, he did not in fact attend liturgy. He paid a 5 minute visit giving a talk and left.

49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-29 15:07:02	@ahmose_I MB represents large portion of Egyptian public. US gov speaks with both gov and opposition
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-29 15:27:21	@ahmose_I MB as organization, or MB as sympathizers, or MB and other Islamists opposed to the coup?
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-29 15:57:56	@ahmose_I very hard to say. I personally believe MB leadership abroad no longer controls MB cadres on ground.
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-29 15:58:48	@ahmose_I In my view we can now speak of three MB's and not one: 1. Prison leadership, 2. Leadership abroad 3. MB activists on the ground
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-29 17:13:36	@ahmose_I Not sure they are waiting for a meeting to believe all sorts of nonsense
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-01-29 17:18:35	@ahmose_I Of course they did. Though I am not sure we would agree on which ones. But the key question is whether they were stupid or evil?

49438467	Samueltadros	2015-02-17 04:24:42	@OrenKessler ones in Libya are Egyptian workers. There are no Libyan Copts. Got wrong Coptic woman. This was about Kamilia not Imbaba woman
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-02-17 04:25:36	@OrenKessler Copts do not complain of marginalization and harassment. It is called persecution and discrimination.

49438467	Samueltadros	2015-03-17 14:39:55	@ahmedamma On activist salafism: the Egyptian scene is unique as I wrote. Most countries have only 1 or 2 activist currents.
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-03-17 14:40:44	@ahmedamma On Rev Salafism, I struggled with this. I do believe they are a new phenomenon and one that will grow a lot and dominate

49438467	Samueltadros	2015-04-13 18:54:21	@MarinaKilada I am also not a fan of the obsession with Coptic language revival. Language is a tool not a goal. Church was wise to turn to A

49438467	Samueltadros	2015-04-13 18:58:09	@MarinaKilada I am all for diversity within the One body of Christ. We can have some churches were English is only language like ones emerg
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-04-13 19:45:05	@MarinaKilada Thanks for the vote of confidence, but I am learning myself. One model that I look back to is the Sunday School movement
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-04-13 19:45:46	@MarinaKilada The future Pope Shenouda, Bishop Samuel, Father Matta El Meskeen, Bishop Gregorious all held different and clashing views
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-04-13 19:46:25	@MarinaKilada Pope Kyrillos, way under appreciated as a political genius, managed the ship with them, and with old guard weary of any reform
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-04-13 19:46:59	@MarinaKilada Sometimes he clashed with x or y, but he managed to move ship forward with all these competing visions coexisting
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-04-13 19:47:38	@MarinaKilada We need to overcome suspicion of diversity. Solution is not to push whole church in one direction, but to allow diff visions
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-04-13 19:48:21	@MarinaKilada as long as same faith is maintained. There are such examples: Coptic Church in sub saharan Africa which allowed local cultural

49438467	Samueltadros	2015-04-13 18:14:47	@MarinaKilada some would argue we are giving up on a lot that is making us distinct such as Coptic language :)
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-04-13 18:15:38	@MarinaKilada but I disagree with notion that elderly will fill pews. I see tens of thousands of youth all around me involved in church serv
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-04-13 18:55:18	@MarinaKilada I do however question notion that if Coptic is still used, only old people will remain. Coptic Church is alive
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-04-13 18:55:49	@MarinaKilada it is not some pews or buildings, it is a living church where a huge percentage of members are involved in services
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-04-13 18:56:25	@MarinaKilada Reform may be needed as you argue, but not because Church may lose people, but because it needs to focus on true mission
49438467	Samueltadros	2015-04-13 18:57:23	@MarinaKilada But one thing to consider is that no one size fits all. Attempting to conform everyone to one style, old or new is problematic

49438467	Samueltadros	2015-05-13 04:09:24	@arwa__mt real problem is that it creates delusions. MB youth await regime collapse every day
