499771747	nicbucky	2012-03-15 17:32:52	Just a little bit luck would be nice
499771747	nicbucky	2012-03-13 15:01:39	Being a red head I get lots more comments about my hair than I did blonde, a lady just stroked my head telling how lovely it is #awkward
499771747	nicbucky	2012-03-13 15:30:07	So apparently sucking a dummy in public, in your teens, is considered cool nowadays?

499771747	nicbucky	2012-03-20 17:10:05	On the speculation that I'm sitting opposite a well known DJ, just heard him speak and he doesn't seem to have a radio voice.....hmmm
499771747	nicbucky	2012-03-20 17:32:22	Ah the 'radio DJ' has got off my stop! Maybe I've just seen him around and that's why he look familiar? Why is this bothering me so?
