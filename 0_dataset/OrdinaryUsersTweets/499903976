499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-07 04:32:30	@jacobkschneider probably because they get less of that kind of clothing on a regular basis. It's a class thing, not race
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-07 04:32:50	@jacobkschneider and yes, race and class can correlate but that doesn't make race the intention
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-07 04:34:47	@TheEhren I don't know, it certainly comes off that way, but it is easier than listing what is acceptable. Idk, it's a private business
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-07 04:35:18	@TheEhren I suppose, but then there is room for loopholes and it makes it harder to enforce
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-07 04:36:44	@TheEhren but at the same time they haven't banned t shirts in general, so it wouldn't fit that profile
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-07 04:38:11	@TheEhren it's a fine line, and until it's taken up in court, it's simply an opinion that they are discriminating

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-08 02:30:52	@Metasota but does that make it okay? If I were to say yeah I'm a racist, always have been, would that be "okay"?

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 18:24:25	@jacobob first off, let's get something straight. Human rights should start at pregnancy. If you literally disagree that is a human, yikes.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 18:32:34	@jacobob do you agree it is life at 6 months pregnancy?
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 18:38:00	@jacobob so men are to have no say on whether human life lies within a women? That's the message you seem to be giving off
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 18:39:52	@jacobob okay that is your opinion and it is valid. But you haven't answered my scientific question. Has nothing to do with choice
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 18:46:28	@xthomx @jacobob it fits within the parameters of the definition. It's just as scientific as global warming, the concept of human life
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 18:51:04	@KimJohnsonWCCO police do not carry automatic rifles. They are semi automatic
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 18:57:47	@xthomx @jacobob so you're saying a 6months along fetus isn't life because it cannot sustain itself?

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 17:54:27	Kurt Zellers answered the question very well. @Jeff4Gov also nailed it. Two clear level headed candidates here.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 17:58:11	@jacobkschneider @tomscheck however, not a part of his legislative action plan so is arguably somewhat irrelevant
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 17:58:50	Those cheesy lines just ruined what was left of Marty Seifert.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 18:16:28	@jacobob it's relevant, not as relevant as if it were a running issue, though. There is a fine line.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 18:17:50	@jacobob that was made very clear in the debate, I thought??
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 19:05:33	@xthomx @jacobob so what about minutes before the baby is delivered? Can we call that human life? All functions are working @ that point
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 19:33:54	@xthomx @jacobob who as in...?
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 19:37:04	@xthomx @jacobob are the ones who decide when the baby is a human being? You're wrong on this. It's time to be done.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 19:41:52	@xthomx my idea is that seconds before a baby is delivered, it is a fully functional human being. Heartbeat, pain, breathing etc.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 19:45:02	@xthomx did I propose that? I don't believe I did. I said nothing about it, actually
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 20:03:35	@xthomx show me where I said I support option to kill babies please.

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-07-30 23:56:41	@jacobkschneider you'd be a fool to argue otherwise.

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-08-20 23:07:47	@Milerliteweight hahahah you act like I haven't seen it dude. I'm a freaking SeaWorld activist
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-08-20 23:09:54	@Milerliteweight you are so ignorant it scares me. You are the one saying a sport is "retarded" so I don't think you can define murder
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-08-20 23:10:28	@Milerliteweight maybe I will dude. Maybe I will. Oh wait, I don't want to because I hate swimming.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-08-20 23:12:19	@Milerliteweight no the fact that you label things as "retarded" tells me you have the maturity level of a 9 year old boy
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-08-20 23:13:43	@Milerliteweight doesn't change the point. People die at work everyday doing what they love and they know the risk.

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-02 21:23:29	I think most US citizens are under the impression that if 1 person with Ebola sneezes in this country, we all die....
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-05 18:39:18	Another deceptive ad using "personally offensive" clip from Mills shows just how concerned Dems are about Nolan's seat, as they should be.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-05 19:06:01	@ImSchultz it's catching on, and there is nothing any of you can do to stop it ;)

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-05 15:36:54	@heyihavecandy yeah but we actually made bets he would so we weren't surprised
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 19:40:45	@emgrundy @MNCRs I find it odd you hold that stance, considering you and I are literally matched on Tinder.. #awkward http://t.co/PgQ0Z8ZEJD
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 19:51:28	@Cailey_Heroff I never forget a tinder match's face üòâ
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 19:57:31	@emgrundy That's not the point. The point is, you were suggesting using tinder funny tinder ads was belittling the intelligence of women
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 19:58:18	@emgrundy And I was pointing out that if Tinder was something that simply belittled or degraded women, it was interesting to see you use it.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 20:03:02	@emgrundy Yes, and this was a FUN graphic college kids could relate to. However, I wouldn't expect the out of touch DFL to understand that
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 20:04:06	@emgrundy Then why is he losing with Millennials in MN? The answer is simple. He is out of touch, and not working for OUR future
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 20:18:12	@emgrundy Don't you want issues relatable to you as a college student?! I don't get what your issue is with a targeted message. 1/2
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 20:19:17	@emgrundy by using this type of advertising, students who "don't care about politics" will be inspired to dig deeper &amp; b more interested!
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 20:28:20	@emgrundy Woah woah it's not like Tinder is just for a random hook up... 

Wait, did we hook up?
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 20:29:05	@emgrundy again, you are just looking too deep into this. This is something that will get students attention, just like the Yik yak one
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-05 16:23:45	Ugh I want to go ride the setup at @skitrollhaugen so bad right now. My office is so close too :/
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-05 16:40:19	NO WAY! @MikeForMN banner being flown around TC Marathon! "McFadden in Senate=Better MN" http://t.co/rArk5NOdzB
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 20:37:14	@emgrundy If your idea of a "Meaningful Policy" is something like MNsure, you better take notes from @MNCRs on tailoring your message. (1/2)
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 20:39:10	@emgrundy because right now, MN are not winning with that policy. It is hurting more than it is helping.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 20:40:43	@emgrundy again with the whole "one size fits all" approach. Look at the disparities between areas of MN and costs of healthcare
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 20:45:44	@emgrundy Being able to purchase private healthcare over state lines would result in competitive prices and overall lower costs
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 20:49:38	@emgrundy I'll shoot you an email. While we're at it, can I buy you dinner? We did match on tinder after all üòò
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 20:57:10	@emgrundy well I will give you a call when I'm out there for CPAC, it's a date.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-06 21:27:46	I'm taking *no response* as a "Wow sure that would be awesome, you seem like a really cool guy!!"

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-07 22:54:55	@JohnCroman is it being streamed somewhere?
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-07 23:15:52	@RealTimers is this streaming live anywhere?
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-07 23:40:47	@uptakemn surprised mining is so low considering the good it would bring to that district. More jobs, more money=rebuilding the middle class
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-07 23:48:40	@uptakemn agreed, and I think the two correlate together so I thought I'd point it out. It would have a big impact up there

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-08 02:47:04	Described as insensitive, offensive, and just plain wrong. She is disappointed in Obermueller and the Dems standing with him tonight.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-10-07 23:01:16	@RealTimers Is the #FlipADistrict event in Northfield being streamed live anywhere?

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-19 04:14:01	@jacobkschneider yeah you're welcome
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-19 06:16:32	The thought of @jacobkschneider walking around the Wild Onion drunk right now showing everyone the cover of Latch I found is sickening

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-23 20:27:08	@MichaelSkolnik I'm curious as to your opinion on Cleveland? Tragic no doubt, but did the officer make the right call?

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-23 06:59:30	Hey @olivegarden, I heard rumors of some Wonderwall cover in Italian you used to play. Please share a link we can't find it

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 01:22:05	Ahead of the decision of the Grand Jury in #Fergsuon, I'd like to go on the record with my prediction. No indictment, no good evidence.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 01:37:52	@AngieHasek @jacobkschneider just wait...
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 01:56:31	Breaking: Grand Jury rules there will be NO indictment of Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting of Mike Brown
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 01:57:24	@andrew_schinds via inside source with CNN
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 02:04:15	Let the rioting against police violence commence, with copious amounts of violence
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 02:43:39	The only problem with the #HandsUpDontShoot social media campaign is that his hands *were not* up
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 02:54:15	Are the people who testified that Mike Brown charged the officer racists or Uncle Toms?

(They were *all* African American)
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 03:01:30	@Cailey_Heroff good q
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 03:49:20	@Stop4no1 @BenIlletschko no one should be dead, but he unfortunately was killed because of his own actions. Not the officer's fault
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 03:53:42	@Stop4no1 not exactly, but we don't know how far he may have taken it. It's a shitty situation, but the officer did as he was trained
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 17:07:50	Hah, reading articles ppl shared on Facebook about how Mike Brown was going to Grandma's minding his own business. 

(After robbing a store)
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 17:34:46	Showing young African Americans that violent protesting is an adequate response to "bad police work" is a great way to end the violence.....
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 17:42:06	What's more embarrassing, is that a 1st year kindergartener would have done a better job protesting than the adults. http://t.co/lNFmiNkcPW
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 17:51:37	I'm sorry to say there were 3 others who commented "white people" on this status.

Absolutely disgusting. http://t.co/v1U5OMHa9V

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 04:12:41	A Fox News camera man was attacked and they destroyed his camera as he filmed them looting.

*so peaceful*
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 04:22:46	Mike Brown's cousin on Fox:

"The media has dehumanized my cousin by making this case about his race. It is not about that"
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 04:25:39	Brown's cousin on Fox-

"These people are nothing but opportunists"
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 04:36:17	Breaking: shots fired in direction of police
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 04:39:11	More shots fired. Live on camera. This is nuts
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 04:44:14	Now reports of planes not landing in STL, but heading back to other airports. Too dangerous to fly into
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 04:48:55	Breaking: The Mayor of St. Louis is demanding the governor send them the National Guard troops immediately. It's getting violent
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 04:49:12	@andrew_schinds correction: Ferguson Mayor, not STL
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 04:52:19	40 more gunshots in the past 15 minutes. At least 2 shooters

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 05:21:07	Yeah Kali, that's why we have a black President.... http://t.co/czDHThBYFo
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 05:28:46	@TheEhren As we were on that day.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 05:31:15	Tough to see black friends of mine posting things saying none of "us white people" care about them. It is actually pretty hurtful to read.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 05:34:02	@MN_Love apparently so. It kind of baffles me
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 05:39:27	PREACH http://t.co/ALL3VaVHvl
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 05:48:17	Hahahah on Fox News people looting a tire store yelled at the camera "this is justice!!" And the camera guy goes "um really? Wow Ok..."
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 05:50:14	Hah, seriously, imagine if The Purge was a real thing, this country wouldn't survive based on what we're seeing tonight... Via: @mattj4226
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 05:51:07	"A cop killed a black kid and wasn't charged, so hell yeah I am seeking justice by stealing a Goodyear tire"
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 05:53:34	Breaking: reports indicate a Ferguson police officer has just been shot
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 05:55:30	@SassyGabe I didn't indicate that. That was a single person.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 05:57:23	@SassyGabe I know more as well as you these are opportunists, and many probably could care less about this case.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 06:04:04	It's not okay for me to label all protesters as the violent looters, but it's okay for you to label all police as racists? 

Oh ok gotcha üëå
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 06:22:04	Can't believe I actually just saw a female reporter on CNN get hit in the head with a rock live in Ferguson.... 

*so peaceful*
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 06:27:43	Seriously, what really breaks my heart is what these savages have done to the family businesses in this area. Their lives are over. So sad
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 06:31:41	@SassyGabe It makes me laugh that you're suggesting I (or others) haven't given Mike Brown enough attention about this. Look at my feed
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 06:32:12	@SassyGabe I have said countless times how tragic this is. You act as if I could give less of a shit he died.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 06:34:47	@SassyGabe hah, my solution for what? This has been so politicizes and racialized that half of you don't know what you're fighting for
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 06:37:10	@SassyGabe what was racist about what happened? That is what you're all missing. Do you not trust our judicial system?
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 06:39:52	@SassyGabe I don't see the relevance though. This didn't start out as a racist case and the only ones who have made it that are protesters
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 06:42:58	@SassyGabe This isn't Trayvon Martin's case, Mike Brown was a criminal
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 06:50:01	@SassyGabe why do you fear police misjudging you? You are taking a small pool of bad apples and labeling all police as that
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 06:52:18	@SassyGabe How is that different from me associating black people with violence and fearing one bad apple who's black could rob or kill me?
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 06:56:14	@SassyGabe Unless you resist or attack, defending yourself shouldn't be an issue. If a black guy pulls a gun on me, I can't defend either
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 06:58:29	@SassyGabe the amount of times he was shot isn't relevant if you look at the timeline of what happened.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 06:58:55	@SassyGabe again, still doesn't address a black guy shooting me for stepping foot in his neighborhood where I don't belong
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 07:02:29	@SassyGabe You think? It clearly does. I'm scared to walk through N Mpls. Most are. That's an arguably bigger issue. Gangs in America
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 07:06:39	@SassyGabe North Mpls is violent, and being white I feel threatened walking through it because I'm not viewed the same
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 07:07:35	@SassyGabe okay that's not racist because I do that to whites regularity. I even call my dad to make it less likely they confront me
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 07:10:08	@SassyGabe You'd be surprised what Kind of discrimination I have taken as a white person. Not bc of race, but many other defining factors
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 07:11:35	@SassyGabe Yes but without realizing you're doing it, you are not addressing my problems. Your interest is black vs white
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 07:13:12	@SassyGabe And I don't like being categorized as a racist because I agree with a grand jury's decision
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 07:14:02	@SassyGabe I know that, and I don't think less of you for not being white. But many people think that of us. It's equal
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 07:17:43	@SassyGabe and I have black family as well. I also have 3 adopted siblings from Russia. I understand difference more than many
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 07:24:10	@SassyGabe indeed.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 07:26:51	@SassyGabe Yeah, likewise. Emotions creeped into our convo, they just turned out less harmful than those emotions in Ferguson. It's a shame
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 07:29:20	@SassyGabe That's the truth. It's a big socioeconomics problem in areas like that. It's what triggers all this
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-11-25 07:59:41	That's enough Ferguson reporting for tonight. Lost over 10 followers, I suppose it's time for bed.

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-12-20 23:17:09	@TheEhren that does not excuse breaking the law. It's not like police could arrest that many people robbing banks. Don't be silly

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-12-20 23:44:13	@TheEhren 2 cops were killed today in the name of Mike Brown and Eric Gardner, in case you missed that...

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-12-21 00:43:42	@TheEhren then why now? Where was your voice last year?
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-12-20 21:36:57	2 police officers were fatally shot execution style during your protest. Where's the outrage? ALL lives matter you ignorant criminals

499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-12-22 21:34:18	I was just falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit and guess what, I cooperated and I'm alive and it's resolved.

Funny how that works.
499903976	andrew_schinds	2014-12-22 21:35:20	Of course I was upset and wanted to scream at the Police saying how dumb they were, but I acted rationally. If only Mike Brown &amp; Eric had...

499903976	andrew_schinds	2015-06-04 23:43:52	Trying out @erniesongull after a good day of fishing. Gotta love the boat parking, just like being at @MaynardsMN! Sort of....
499903976	andrew_schinds	2015-06-05 00:43:51	A waitress just had the nerve to ask if that was my boat floating away on Gull Lake. Please..... I'm a dock boy http://t.co/kDrntlLhti
