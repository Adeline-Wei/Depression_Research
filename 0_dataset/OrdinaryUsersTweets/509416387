509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-21 21:30:06	That landing was so scary. Finally glad to be back home.

509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-23 10:36:22	I am who I am. First person I need to make happy is myself. I'm still growing up, but that doesn't change my values and worth.
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-23 10:40:16	It's sad to see a women change their looks to fit a image for a guy. It's even more sad when they try to change their values to match them.
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-23 10:51:41	Stay true to yourself. A real man would find that more attractive than most qualities.
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-23 10:55:52	A real man is hard to come by. I only know a few similar to my age.
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-22 23:06:08	@_justlovenohate might have been feeling good at that moment. Lmao.

509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-24 02:05:33	@bowlingprodigy I wouldn't lie ! I have a good memory.
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-24 02:12:53	@t5james I would need wayyy more convincing to become a ND fan. I haven't even seen Rudy lol. Isn't that a requirement of a ND fan?
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-24 02:14:22	@bowlingprodigy you still talk about it!
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-24 02:22:00	@t5james Im open minded..so ill watch it. Maybe I should become more of a college football fan anyways. Lol
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-24 02:29:08	@bowlingprodigy Chan you make me sad :'(
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-24 02:33:50	@t5james it's a definite possibility.
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-24 02:34:29	@bowlingprodigy you didn't believe me :(
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-24 02:49:57	@bowlingprodigy I guess that's better than nothing.
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-23 14:20:02	I cannot believe I broke the back side of my phone last night.
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-23 15:55:11	I think I'm going to try and convince my brother to buy me some golf clubs. Good idea? I think so!
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-23 16:42:05	My annual Christmas tradition starts today: wrap all the family's presents and do some baking for tomorrow.
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-23 16:54:06	@ZmACK_that_ass you know if you need a really really good friend, like me, to go with you. I'd be more than happy to. Lmao
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-23 16:55:22	@ZmACK_that_ass seriously though that's an awesome bday present. Hope you have a good time!
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-23 17:21:37	@theetaylorbooth You still won't take me.

509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-23 22:51:06	My mom is a superhero. I hope I can be half the mom she is to me.
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-24 00:49:57	@12kenna I hope your game is up to par. If she's does follow you back...omg.
509416387	carlina_s	2012-12-24 01:20:40	I just one thing...but it won't happen.

509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-13 11:35:14	I feel like it's going to take all week to get caught back on sleep. #stilltired  #headache.

509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-18 15:14:20	I'm not even 21 yet and I couldn't imagine having two young children and being engaged. I'm taking my life nice and slow.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-18 15:48:35	My nephew is taking his preschool test today...can't be real life. 😥
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-16 06:43:01	Almost 3am and I'm still up. #whoa

509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-16 19:36:12	Ready for tonight. :)
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-17 18:48:17	@devan_hick LOVE! Wednesday is the start of my spring break! We need to meet up ASAP!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-17 23:59:09	For the first time in awhile, I'm dumbfounded and speechless. I can't believe what I just heard.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-18 02:12:05	My motivation is zero. Not good. 😑
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-21 20:12:54	You would think my parents would have told me that they changed the locks on the house and given me a new house key. But nope. #lockedout.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-21 20:14:08	Now what to do..
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-19 03:40:00	What you say flows from what is in your heart.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-19 12:55:36	One more exam tomorrow!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-19 14:39:01	I can't do my roommates anymore. #reallycant.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-19 19:22:42	I hate this part....
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-21 21:55:33	3 hours later...still haven't been in my house.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-19 22:59:48	In our weakness He is strong.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-19 17:16:01	I keep thinking today is Wednesday...
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-19 21:07:36	I'm thinking about getting a deep meaningful tattoo. Something really special.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-20 13:59:30	My twitter is messing up.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-20 00:07:45	I never realized how funny the "DJs" are on the SOML Radio show on http://t.co/lD1oqRzcav. #nightbeingmade.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-20 00:08:50	#LifeofRalph I eat a lot of cereal and slap my knee when something is funny.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-20 00:12:06	@GarettMansfield that's what I hear! Seems like a good idea right now.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-20 00:25:36	@martyporter21 I hate you!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-20 00:26:15	Night made! :)

509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-29 01:56:23	My brother and I just got pulled over and he doesn't get a ticket. He has got to be the luckiest guy alive.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-29 03:35:59	When I read all the Hoosier posts, it makes me realize how proud to be an Irish fan. Win or lose it doesn't matter, I've found my team. :)
509416387	carlina_s	2013-03-29 06:19:39	Can't sleep at all, too much on my mind.

509416387	carlina_s	2013-04-10 19:39:30	Lazy day.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-04-10 22:22:13	Anyone want to see 42 on Friday? I really want to see it!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-04-10 23:52:54	@keaserII movie about Jackie Robinson.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-04-10 03:30:02	You should never have to earn acceptance. It's in each human being to feel accepted by someone. We change just to feel that and that is sad.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-04-10 03:31:40	Smart people aren't always wise people. Funny how that works.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-04-10 03:33:47	@keaserII I was inspired but yes, those are my own words/thoughts.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-04-10 03:36:38	@keaserII thanks! :)
509416387	carlina_s	2013-04-10 03:47:49	Always pray for those that are close to you in your life.

509416387	carlina_s	2013-04-12 16:59:47	I need food and sleep.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-04-10 12:28:57	There's absolutely no way I'm running today!! 😣 So sore.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-04-14 17:23:23	I feel like I missed a great time last night.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-04-13 02:05:04	By far the greatest baseball/sports movie I've ever seen. #42

509416387	carlina_s	2013-04-15 21:48:08	#prayersforBoston truly sad. People need a faith of something.

509416387	carlina_s	2013-05-09 17:14:09	#girlcode the best part of having a slutty friend is when at a club all the guys she gets aren't the type of guys for you.

509416387	carlina_s	2013-05-17 14:57:01	@theetaylorbooth the longest part is the yes, no questions. Being that it's in a group setting then maybe a little after an hour. Possibly.

509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-17 12:26:23	Looks like I'm buying me some new Nikes today, and maybe some new jeans!!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-14 20:45:26	Christopher Columbus wasn't his real name. He was Italian so we Americanize his real name.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-16 17:43:00	I've never felt this secure and or this happy.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-18 03:31:00	Texting is a foreign concept to me tonight. #ClumsyThumbsy
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-18 12:17:06	Sooo happy, glad, stoked, today is Friday!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-19 23:43:37	We battled today and it was simply fun!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-20 18:26:03	Taking full responsibility to why we lost that last match. Two opens did it.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-23 19:49:19	I don't always cut my guy friends hair, but when I do I make sure they look good.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-22 02:00:11	I simply cannot wait to be someone's special person. #patience #It'llBeWorthIt
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-24 01:03:56	I takes more effort in explaining that I'm not in high school. For now on, I'm in high school. Lol
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-25 02:21:18	I have an urge to talk to that one person, but then I realize to stay patient.     It's not in my timing.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-25 03:57:13	Ladies we are God's gift to men. Love them full heartily. As long as they are men themselves.

509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-26 04:33:08	Wish I had better words to say.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-27 01:20:31	This is a gifted response!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-27 11:41:06	To everyone bowling in tournaments today, good luck!!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-27 23:03:11	Only I would get lost on Bluelick road. I need sleep.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-24 13:29:46	Motivated this morning. 👍
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-24 18:20:59	This is a gifted response.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-26 23:00:43	Holy buckets :)
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-28 12:43:34	This is going to be a crazy chaotic week.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-28 16:00:58	@keaserII hasn't yelled at you *yet*. Lol I just like to sit in the back.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-28 16:01:29	I'm just so absolutely stoked! #Happy
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-28 17:32:09	You have to be grateful for the little things or you'll never be grateful at all.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-29 13:40:20	Today is going to be a crazy day. Class, practice, tutoring the girls, practice, eat, then study all night.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-29 19:56:03	My bosses just gave me a whole bunch of Vietnamese food for doing a good job with their daughters! #PerksofworkingwithAsians
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-29 03:19:34	Sunday couldn't come soon enough!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-30 03:23:39	&lt;3 pray &lt;3
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-30 13:26:38	Refuse to stop trying. Refuse to give up. Refuse to think you'll fail. Just believe.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-30 15:18:39	You know when you have a crappy professor when he gives a 22 point curve so at least half the class will actually pass the test. Result:94%
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-31 03:26:37	"Wait for me at night. Wait for me in the silence. Let me give you my tenderness to take away your pain. I still believe in miracles."
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-31 03:45:29	I'm awake. This isn't normal. All I want to watch is 'Wait Till Next Year,' and I can't. #annoyed
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-30 21:51:55	@ZmACK_that_ass glad to know you'll be a new man!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-10-30 21:55:05	@ZmACK_that_ass new stuff is the best!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-03 19:25:25	Great Sunday! Absolutely beautiful.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-03 21:46:13	I just want you to know who I am.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-02 16:34:22	At least now I'm going to have a more healthier diet. #winning
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-04 15:58:17	Even though @Bugss15 crushed his Mountain Dew all over the trunk of his car, he clutched some new tape, and a new towel for me. Thanks hero!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-04 15:59:00	@Bugss15 don't be mad! You made my day!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-04 18:47:02	I'm so tired of my face being so broke out...all the time. #dontknowhattodo
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-05 22:04:23	I'm so frustrated. I practice with Lou and feel like a pro afterwards. I come to practice with Brian and feel completely horrible.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-05 02:55:19	I irritate myself.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-06 04:20:29	Get up at 7 am to study for a test tomorrow. #yup #getthatA
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-05 19:40:48	18 days left!! #NDGame

509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-07 13:49:44	That was possibly one of the best starts to my day. Greater thing are yet to come. #Blessed #Believe
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-08 14:58:03	Whom shall I fear?! I'm holding onto your promises. You are faithful.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-10 22:31:00	My finger is killing me! #BowlingBattleWonds
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-07 23:37:10	I would love a man to take my bowling bag out of my car every single night in the winter. Figures crossed for my future man. 🙏
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-11 03:40:32	Monday+No classes+No practice= Best Monday.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-11 05:47:49	Well then...
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-11 15:53:40	I dare you to move.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-09 14:37:56	@Bugss15 good luck to my hero today!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-08 21:04:05	I am someone new.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-11 19:36:53	1 week and 4 days to go!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-09 17:11:39	You'd think this tournament is a big party with the music their playing, and girls dancing. Not sure what to think.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-12 00:53:20	Got a cooking lesson tonight. #StuffedPeppers #Legit
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-12 02:03:15	I know exactly what my next tattoo will be!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-12 03:32:01	Snow is the only reason why I crave summers. So I'm thankful for the snow.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-12 22:09:31	I #LovetheLanes, but somedays I'm not feeling it.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-13 00:22:23	Stoked that our tournament is only for one day!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-13 05:06:55	I feel like everyone is getting sick...including myself.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-10 02:26:45	When you hope for something then you're let down. #sucks
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-15 17:01:20	@bowlingprodigy I believe you are winning this between @theetaylorbooth hahahahaha
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-18 14:24:42	Tired and sick.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-17 17:28:50	Well that didn't work out as I hoped it was going to. #NotInMyTiming
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-16 08:20:14	I wish all the things we say at 3 am could be recorded. #hilarious #sleepdeprived
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-17 20:09:40	Super stoked for Thanksgiving and to have five weeks off from school! #hurrybreak
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-18 19:36:33	I don't always get sick but when I do, I just want to sleep.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-14 19:40:52	If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face, I would everyday of my life.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-14 23:52:30	There's only one approval I'm trying to meet...
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-15 00:15:07	Meeting someone new from my church. Praying that I'll just be a great encouraging friend for her.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-19 03:06:17	Going to bed at 10 pm. Absolutely. Ready to feel better!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-15 06:18:17	I'm still awake...not real life.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-18 03:06:19	I just want to go for a ride and look at the night time stars.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-19 03:59:04	@matt111smith you are so welcome, Matt! Anytime!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-15 14:17:45	There's two things I hate 1)putting gas in my car, 2) getting up.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-19 15:09:54	Regardless if I still feel sick, I am blessed.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-19 16:36:56	Getting really excited for the Irish game this Saturday!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-19 16:59:27	They are not nice. Don't joke about having a test.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-19 17:47:33	@Bugss15 I'm not gullible! Just have faith in you guys too much.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-22 14:24:35	It's fair to say I'm going to be watch Rudy tonight!

509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-22 03:31:09	The voice of truth says, "Do not be afraid."
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-20 05:10:36	On bright side: that may have been one of the best moments in my life earlier tonight.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-23 16:00:00	It's cold but our hearts are warm @NDgameday #ND4LIFE
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-21 14:23:25	I simply did not want to wake up this morning.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-23 23:28:21	In rain, snow, sleet, and or temperatures blow 30 degrees- doesn't matter this is #NDgameday #NDFB http://t.co/eU2C9pS85V
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-20 14:53:29	Did all I could. Now it's time to show what I know, even if it's the bare minimum.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-20 15:45:46	@matt111smith thanks Matt. You too!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-20 15:50:25	Just realized @Bugss15 and myself are Louie's prodigies! Hahaha #GreatRealization
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-20 15:55:51	I believe that test was successful.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-20 18:56:48	I hope that the weather is like this on Saturday! #beautiful

509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-25 13:28:08	I can't focus on studying when all I can think about is going home, and having five weeks off!!

509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-03 01:30:16	You'll get thru this. It won't b painless. It won't b quick. Don't be foolish or naive. Don't despair. With Gods help you'll get thru this.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-03 02:56:36	I need to stop wanting.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-03 16:47:28	@Bugss15 you can do it HERO!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-03 16:48:13	Going to busy day, so blessed not to have classes right now!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-11-30 05:06:03	Thankfully, I trust in him.

509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-10 16:44:40	@Big_Sean21 I miss you handsome boo! I'm bowling in the Lima City Singles.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-10 17:29:30	@Big_Sean21 no practice for me. I tore my finger open so I got to let it heal before Saturday.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-09 03:23:37	Sometimes I just wish to know.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-13 21:06:42	@ZmACK_that_ass in reality you actually probably do that.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-15 05:56:00	Just got done bowling and carried a 192 average. #pleased

509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-30 02:08:04	Everyone knows, "I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength," but you really believe that? #IBelieve
509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-30 14:30:58	If this is any indication of how the day is going to go, it's going to be a horrible day.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-27 21:17:11	@Bugss15 I do too! This sucks!
509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-30 18:59:17	This practice session #nogood
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-01 18:25:17	@MisterBeardMan best friend! Best friend! Best friend! BEST FRIEND! #bf
509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-31 00:03:50	I think this is the most I have not laughed in one day.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-01 23:01:11	Running on fumes.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-02 00:15:59	I surprise myself every now and again.
509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-31 05:51:50	Okay okay. No matter what #support
509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-31 06:30:41	@Bugss15 how old :)
509416387	carlina_s	2013-12-31 15:55:41	Making some tough realizations but I have the greatest friends in the world supporting me! #Blessed
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-03 20:35:46	My silence is my self-defense.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-03 15:23:40	Last official day of this break for me. #sad
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-06 06:22:32	Maybe I'm too sensitive.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-06 17:49:17	I'm getting my thyroid checked out. #awesome
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-07 18:14:13	@theetaylorbooth we will have class for sure tomorrow. #nodoubts
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-07 18:15:16	Counting down the day to one year. #oneyearofchange #oneyearstrong #oneyearsingle
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-08 16:35:07	@Bugss15 forgot to give you my nano!!
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-08 16:48:49	@Bugss15 sounds like a plan!
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-10 15:49:55	I love nothing more than to get a full nights rest and still be exhausted throughout the day. #needanswers
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-10 16:48:48	Stotts maybe the funniest professor ever
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-10 16:58:27	So many tall people 😵
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-10 17:16:30	@Bugss15 not a problem lol history is my thing!
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-12 22:00:24	So emotionally drained.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-13 00:02:33	I have to admit, I had the best cheering crowd yesterday. #churchfamily #lovethem http://t.co/stRas0cTiq

509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-11 15:12:38	Life just got a whole lot harder. #trust
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-13 12:40:37	It should be a sin to be this tired.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-13 14:05:00	I feel like a little kid when I sit in these bio chairs.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-13 16:19:07	@theetaylorbooth if you like to help people out, can you please keep a look out on a job position for me ? :)
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-14 00:02:26	I hear a voice....ahh yes, that would be biggby calling my name.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-17 13:53:26	I just love Fridays.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-17 18:11:17	“@8_Semesters: #ImThankfulFor no Friday classes” Every business student wishes to say that. #OnlyUNOH @UNOH_PRBLMS

509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-16 15:29:44	Truth &gt; emotions. The truth I know makes me happy and fulfilled.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-15 14:56:33	Hope to find some answers today. #tiredofbeingtired
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-17 23:10:02	Bluffton tonight!
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-19 14:32:06	You are my shield; my strength; my shelter; and my strong tower.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-18 12:57:17	I slept absolutely horrible last night.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-20 00:08:59	Is it bad I want to wear my Manning Colts jersey for the Super Bowl?! 💙
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-20 03:20:47	Yeah this week is going to be hard and sad. #HavingFaith

509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-23 01:19:10	Just one more day...tomorrow is going to be rough.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-23 22:59:27	Military rites are beyond beautiful.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-23 15:21:40	@theetaylorbooth scary!
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-24 23:14:33	If official, I need a walking sign for "Fragile!"
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-27 02:26:32	How can I do homework when I can't put the music down?
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-26 13:09:55	Bowl great today, my teammates! #missuall
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-25 14:07:58	Good luck to all my amazing teammates this weekend! I know long, flat, and 40 some units of oil to bowl on, but have faith within yourself!
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-27 01:41:51	Because when you are with me I am free. I'm careless. I believe.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-26 04:08:13	Go get them tomorrow ladies and boys!! #GoodLuck
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-26 04:54:23	I'm tired of being what seems like a pit of despair.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-26 13:41:11	@theetaylorbooth that's the perfect song to get pumped up for a tournament hahaha
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-26 14:10:23	This is just wonderful. #totalsarcasm
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-29 05:23:32	It's so cold in my room I feel as if I can see my breath
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-29 16:44:41	@Bugss15 first off, it's my size. Second off, I'll get it custom fitted.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-29 16:49:20	I love to be joked around with and joke with other people, but I love serious in depth conversations.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-29 16:50:46	@BriiKing5 best classes ever. #lovehistory
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-29 19:37:26	@BriiKing5 what class?
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-31 16:34:55	In 2 weeks I went from losing my car, grandpa, and job. Yesterday, I accepted a job offer, and got approved for a car. #GodisGood #blessed
509416387	carlina_s	2014-01-31 16:35:51	When you feel as if your drowning from pain, emotions, stresses, finances..there's hope in the middle of it all.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-01 11:09:55	12 more days. #oneyearofchange #oneyearsingle
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-02 20:31:38	Changing me from the inside out.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-04 13:42:31	I'm dying to keep my head in a book for my classes. #alwaystired #notenoughhoursinaday
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-05 04:45:18	Please no school tomorrow. #please
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-05 04:51:24	Don't ever blend in. #ever
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-05 19:30:46	Cancelled school, work, and AWANA. #AllDayHomeworkDay #jammieday
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-06 18:50:45	If I didn't have this homework to do, I'd be watching Netflix all day.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-12 05:16:21	There's freedom in this grace. Because of it I've been able to put the pieces of my life back into place.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-08 23:03:10	Feels awesome to have food in my stomach finally!
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-09 01:51:55	I can't wait to be home. Thinking the most random thoughts are driving me crazy.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-12 15:26:26	Just ready for a nap
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-11 03:32:33	Right now in this very moment, I need you.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-11 04:33:08	My faith is the reason why I crave true love whole heartily.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-11 14:09:19	Keep calm and...what was I saying 😍
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-13 12:54:57	Can't believe I've made it a year single. #YearOfChange #AYearOfFreedomAndVictory
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-13 02:01:58	Tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow!
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-18 03:28:46	The way I feel matters but if it's not going to benefit both parties, then why say it?
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-17 01:27:44	Got to love it when you feel like you've dropped the ball
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-19 04:20:59	I would love to be closer, but it's a two way street. :|
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-17 23:53:34	@BriiKing5 I could cry just thinking of it!
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-20 04:15:48	Know the feeling when you are so hungry all you want to do is eat a whole bucket of KFC chicken, but yet you are so tired you couldn't eat?
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-20 15:57:44	Leaving soon for Pittsburg to see Billy Joel in concert tomorrow! #letsgo!!
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-20 15:59:14	@MisterBeardMan best friend ❤️
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-14 15:31:56	I'm so happy.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-14 19:33:49	If you don't love yourself, than who will love you?
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-22 07:42:44	This could possibly be one of my worst fears revealed; however, I have faith! #Always #GodisStronger #faithful
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-15 04:02:42	Fighting this unfortunately.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-24 00:54:35	My mom is in really high spirits! #StrongWomen #BeatthisMom #SuckitLeukemia

509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-16 13:55:44	Smart girls know their worth, now they're the ones to keep by your side.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-27 19:29:30	I want this quarter to be over with already. So not taking summer classes. #summeroff
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-26 15:03:21	Found out my mom's leukemia is CML, which is treatable form with medicine! There's always hope in darkness. 🙏 #suckitcancer
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-26 15:05:51	@KDeMara thank you, Kayce!!
509416387	carlina_s	2014-02-26 18:49:02	Seriously how does somebody leave their purse at the testing center? #reasonswhyidontcarryapurse
509416387	carlina_s	2014-03-02 01:49:35	Not religious. Not into your impressions of a faith. There's so much about having a relationship with God than you know. #Happiness #Saved
509416387	carlina_s	2014-03-01 16:08:21	My mom is finally being released from the hospital TODAY! 🙏😘 #praiseworthy

509416387	carlina_s	2014-03-03 01:24:07	Speak with humbled lips.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-03-03 03:23:54	It will be a miracle if I complete all my homework assignments this week with everything that's going on. Homework = back burner
509416387	carlina_s	2014-03-03 13:41:00	9 more days left of classes 😳
509416387	carlina_s	2014-03-03 15:26:52	This day has been horrible.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-03-04 15:23:59	Thinking about getting a leukemia tattoo for my mom. So ready for her to be out of the hospital.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-03-05 23:22:51	Yes! Finally my mom is #home
509416387	carlina_s	2014-03-06 16:58:34	@BriiKing5 hahahaha that made my day :)

509416387	carlina_s	2014-03-17 15:47:06	I feel like I'm dying.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-03-15 17:04:29	I just want one amazing weekend. Where my laughter is filled with tears, and where my heart will melt in happiness.

509416387	carlina_s	2014-03-21 04:06:05	#love is the greatest emotion. Sadly, we abuse it, use it, degrade it, punish it, regret it, persecute it, laugh about it, and not know it.

509416387	carlina_s	2014-03-23 20:27:39	My strength is found in my weaknesses. Be praise worthy for them.

509416387	carlina_s	2014-11-19 23:06:47	It's more than wanting something. You have to have the desire, the right frame of mind, and the passion to go after it.
509416387	carlina_s	2014-11-22 02:14:44	I seriously thought my phone was a goner. Never been so relieved when it turned on.
