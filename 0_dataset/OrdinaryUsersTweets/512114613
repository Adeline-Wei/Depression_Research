512114613	DarrenMcBurnie	2014-03-04 18:06:15	Well that's 12 minutes I will never get back! What a ridiculously bias argument for Scottish independence! What a joke!
512114613	DarrenMcBurnie	2014-04-29 19:26:35	I cannot believe what I am watching! Real Madrid are making Bayern Munich look like school boys!
512114613	DarrenMcBurnie	2014-05-07 20:37:31	Oh my god! Yaya Toure is phenomenal!
512114613	DarrenMcBurnie	2014-05-08 15:33:40	Nothing getsme going more than someone who has clearly done no research, trying to 'educate' me on the pros of being an independent Scotland
512114613	DarrenMcBurnie	2014-05-08 15:35:04	Take your bias and factually incorrect points somewhere else pal!

512114613	DarrenMcBurnie	2014-08-12 21:01:21	Wow! The yes campaign and it's supporters are so disillusioned! You can't keep the pound, now move on!
512114613	DarrenMcBurnie	2014-08-25 10:19:18	Man U have a gaping hole in the centre of the pitch, left by arguably the best CM to ever play in the league...so they chase another winger!
512114613	DarrenMcBurnie	2014-09-02 20:15:30	Why do the Yes party feel the need to go for a walk whilst debating, just stand at your podium, answer the questions and ditch the facade!
512114613	DarrenMcBurnie	2014-09-02 21:09:35	Yes voters blaming Trident for child poverty and our reliance on foodbanks, when the accumulative spend on Trident is 0.01% of the UK budget
512114613	DarrenMcBurnie	2014-09-02 21:13:46	@CameronBrooks6 an independent Scotland would have 3500 troops! Unless they are 3500 John Smeatons,  we are well fucked!
