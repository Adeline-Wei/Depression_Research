533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-04 20:33:59	@Alex_Sloan but It's really not that bad on its own. Other than it sort of sounding like a really heavy ADTR album.

533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-26 09:34:52	@PaulSamsen nice! Will you be living downtown?
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-26 09:40:26	Give up the badass act. No one cares.

533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-28 06:41:10	@JaymeBurris penguins are the best. Especially those darn penguins from Madagascar.
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-28 06:45:11	@Aynsleyhensgen FEEL U.
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-26 06:42:17	@stacyfortheday this is why you need to stop dating double amputees.
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-29 13:19:06	@Aynsleyhensgen but squads are okay, if you're picking up what I'm putting down.
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-29 14:06:17	I'm not saying I need to date yvonne strahovski. I'm just saying I need to date someone who looks and acts exactly like her.
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-30 03:36:08	Lately life has felt like a never-ending nickelback song.
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-27 09:57:42	@RistaFlanagan you are such a night owl.
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-27 09:59:23	@RistaFlanagan we can rest when we're dead.
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-30 07:53:58	The strangest night in a long time. I'm cool with it.

533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-30 08:37:49	@Alex_Sloan related note: I hung out with Stephanie Hebscheur for a brief moment tonight.
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-30 08:39:15	I love your off the wall humor. #positivesubtweet
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-30 08:47:33	@Alex_Sloan I know exactly who that was about. And I was at her house! Weird life.
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-31 21:24:10	@Alex_Sloan maybe Amy the Winona state hipster stole it.
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-30 20:21:27	I don't have trouble sleeping, and no one is going to take that away from me.
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-28 02:33:18	@Abel_Tres come to Marion and kick it with me for a day.
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-28 02:38:38	@Abel_Tres IM IN ARK RIGHT NOW BRAH!
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-28 02:40:52	@Abel_Tres right by west Memphis. I'm not terribly far from the center of the state.
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-28 02:42:03	@Abel_Tres I've been to seven states in the last week. Our definition of far may vary slightly.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-01 04:43:36	It's a craft beer new year!

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-03 10:16:07	Reliving high school vicariously through degrassi reruns. Remember when they stabbed JT? Ugh!
533467927	blakeapgar	2012-12-29 01:59:07	@GopherSports I'm in the Memphis area. Where can I listen to the game?!
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-01 19:27:24	You say fuck the world? I say fuck you.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-01 19:37:53	@KalynWilkinson @tcamosy so does umn but they really screw us. My books this semester are around 300. Bleh.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-01 19:39:46	@tcamosy @kalynwilkinson I made that mistake last semester. I hardly used any of them. I could have saved so much.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-01 20:55:28	I'm at common grounds. Come hang out.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-01 22:01:51	Geese, you're drunk. Go home. http://t.co/CsL8IMbA
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-01 23:15:34	Ugh. Almost 9 months til @GopherGridiron. I guess I'll just twiddle my thumbs til then.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-02 00:32:56	@saturatedgiggle all this time goose island was in my own backyard.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-02 00:36:02	Bring it home for the #B1G, sconnie!

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-02 08:32:45	@Stephanie_Sax uh duh! I love raw.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-02 09:04:43	I'm pretty sure that since I survived 2012 with more confidence than I've ever had before, I can do just about anything now.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-04 07:51:18	Walking through the drive thru with Alex Llanas. Classic.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-04 08:45:18	@PaulSamsen good night Sam!
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-04 09:43:50	There comes a day when you rectify who you are with who you want to be with, and I can't make the two things coexist.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-04 18:17:50	@stacyfortheday what the actual fuck is that?
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-05 03:01:29	@stacyfortheday you too! I need to come down there. üå¥

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-06 04:00:08	Come to claws. Shoot pool with me and Cody.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-06 09:22:08	As long as I'm home, I can dig up these bones. There's no point in just letting go.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-11 22:51:39	People who still take peace sign selfies are the worst kind of people.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-11 18:11:07	@brentonsprague @barryxredfern lol. Dude said "fact".
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-08 19:46:48	Catching the loose ends show tonight. Pretty stoked.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-13 22:11:34	@clairetworek that is so metal.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-12 07:56:06	@clairetworek shave it. You won't.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-12 08:00:34	@clairetworek you aren't punk enough.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-12 11:01:38	It's 5 in the morning. Just listening to my amateur love record while laying in bed. So calming.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-14 03:59:57	So I got a new roommate. This time from Korea. Consider me the US ambassador to all of Asia.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-14 04:32:00	@ChrisYafchak no, but he can translate gangnam style for me.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-14 05:31:36	Never ran away for the sake of scars.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-07 05:32:16	Clairebear is coming to the dirty K!
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-07 06:08:32	I say tomato, you say tomato. Doesn't make much sense when you tweet it.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-14 11:34:56	I tweet things and then I'm like, "god damnit, why do I have to be better than this?" Then I delete it and fall back into obscurity.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-15 02:50:08	@Alex_Sloan ten fucking roommates. Ten of them.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-15 09:45:24	I found Stephen and Jordan. They're at IHOP at 3AM and they're totally hammered. Rest assured, they're doing well for themselves, seriously.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-14 22:44:53	I have been through ten roommates this year. Ten.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-10 06:16:29	Give up.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-14 23:42:51	Take me back to Minneapolis.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-15 01:41:53	At what age is it acceptable to give up and make an eharmony account?
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-15 04:44:28	@PaulSamsen on it.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-15 04:45:00	John Cena: least favorite wrestler. Absolute favorite dude.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-15 22:09:10	I want a cat just so I can name it Kitty Cudi.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-16 03:28:33	Oh I will be mad if the badgers beat the Hoosiers. From a gopher fan, go IU!
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-16 03:34:17	By all means I should be rooting for Wisconsin because Indiana is #2. I just can't.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-16 12:06:13	Truth be told, I'm still trying to eat this tiny elephant. One bite at a time, as per usual.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-20 06:15:29	I have known @PaulSamsen for ten years.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-20 09:58:51	I love @Alex_Sloan @ChrisYafchak and @PaulSamsen with everything. I will miss them terribly.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-20 10:45:59	Plot twist, I think @Voonxxx is a really great dude.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-18 00:01:38	Eh. At least I have two homies to count on.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-21 06:43:22	@Voonxxx someone favorited your something and I was like, "that kid. I don't hate him! I'd really like to play pop punk with him."
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-21 08:21:44	Should have gone to U of A. That's ice, homies. http://t.co/Qq997IcO

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-21 08:38:53	Sorry @chipotletweets, I was going to shave my beard for my interview tomorrow, but the high here in Minneapolis is -6. Hope you understand.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-21 18:55:40	@stacyfortheday see you soon!
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-18 11:19:10	Being more mature than talking shit to people via twitter: a blessing and a curse.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-18 11:34:42	I'm wide awake. It's morning.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-18 11:39:39	I'm just #TFTC.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-18 11:46:21	Get it together. Failure's not flattering.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-18 13:42:28	@Stephanie_Sax slept through the night. It's the first time in a long time I've been up this early.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-22 03:23:48	I took a time machine back to 08 and just watched Corruptor kill it at McKinley elementary. Again.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-22 03:39:23	Claire gets so butthurt when I talk about medusa. Ha.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-22 06:35:28	@PaulSamsen WORLDDDD STARRRR!
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-22 06:41:31	Whore now autocorrects to who're? Well played, apple. Well played.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-22 20:03:49	Okay, this is the last ill say of this: I never thought I would consider 20¬∞ warm. I just want both the high and low to be above 0¬∞.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-22 23:06:20	This was on my first assignment for math. I can hear @Abel_Tres laughing all the way in Fayetteville. http://t.co/0t6lP5Al
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-22 23:15:54	@Abel_Tres college algebra and probability. But I am in the science of cooking! It fills a requirement without having to take physics. Bam.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-22 23:16:50	@Abel_Tres also, give me the address of the douchebag who retweeted you. Haha.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-22 23:17:35	@Abel_Tres BECAUSE ROCKS AND STARS AND FISH DIDN'T PIQUE ME INTEREST OKAY. K.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-22 23:19:44	@Abel_Tres I didn't want to take geology, astronomy, or oceanography because physical science will be the death of me.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-23 01:38:12	Suckin' at something is the first step to being kinda good at something.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-18 18:10:17	I'm most pissed at Lance Armstrong for ruining the end of Dodgeball for me.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-23 02:22:30	Taught Daden the proper usage of the word "douchebag".
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-23 02:27:48	I can't say you will acquire the cleanest vocabulary or pick up the best habits, but if you're from another country and you are living with

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-23 02:37:43	I challenge you to find a catchier riff than the permanent rain by the dangerous summer.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-18 20:34:18	Don't ask me how I've been.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-23 06:34:50	Weekend Nachos in mpls? I found a reason to go to medusa. Ugh.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-24 17:07:44	I had a terrible nightmare in which I tattooed my name above my belly button. 'Twas my reason for seeming disgruntled this morning.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-24 19:21:57	It's colder here, but I'm better off this way.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-24 22:27:41	Stoked and super proud of @PaulSamsen. Have fun in the city!

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-19 19:56:05	@Alex_Sloan @bgudmundson when was this?
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-19 20:06:15	@Alex_Sloan Alex you're so cute! You're a terrible excuse for a person, but you're cute cute ceeeeeeuuuuuute!
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-24 15:34:07	Considering I woke up at 8:40, I'm impressed I showered and made it to my St. Paul class 20 minutes early.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-20 00:29:53	It's sinister, but it's how life worked out.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-01-20 00:55:18	@Alex_Sloan am I seeing you tonight?

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-20 19:18:21	Considering the world headquarters are located here, it sure is difficult to find a best buy around here.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-10 06:58:47	Is @rachelstoebe Minneapolis tonight?!
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-13 03:43:13	The GOP response? Lol. LOL.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-13 03:45:46	Why would anyone oppose a background check to get a gun?

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-19 19:02:34	I just really want a decent camera to start making short films with.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-19 19:04:27	I would like to sit in my grumpy old man chair and drink grumpy old man coffee all day.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-19 19:07:14	*and listen to frightened rabbit
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-21 19:14:53	I guess I've never responded well to being an honorable mention, so there's that.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-21 19:46:28	@grantwill @alex_sloan here we go!

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-21 21:36:48	I don't think I love anything the way that some people love morrissey. It's just, nothing speaks to me that way.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-17 03:07:39	Will you be my Zooey Deschanel?
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-22 00:16:54	I wonder what people think when they see me with my headphones in going full on @headabovewater singing Suburbia.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-22 00:24:35	I had a terrible terrible dream last night in which I created an Instagram account.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-17 22:16:37	Budish got the W in that.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-18 07:04:45	@Alex_Sloan is it made from the hair of Jesus?
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-18 07:41:59	It's almost 2. I'm craving rawvioli. Who wants to get a tree huggin, dirty hippie, vegan lunch at ecopolitan in uptown tomorrow?
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-02-20 20:44:03	Taylor Swift is more of a brand than an artist. A brand I'm shamelessly obsessed with.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-08 17:57:21	It's 30¬∞. That's hoodie weather.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-08 19:09:35	Vice is a shitty news source.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-13 05:05:12	We're about to get so damn progressive and it's awesome. Minnesota: you do you. #time4marriage
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-08 20:38:29	The Wrestler is on FX. Ttyl.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-08 21:27:01	@saturatedgiggle oh, I'm not arguing that. I read it for entertainment. It's just a terrible news source.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-09 00:05:24	@clairetworek *when you scream about how nice their asses are
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-09 00:12:15	@clairetworek agreed wholeheartedly.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-13 18:12:06	Rome was a lot like high school, only instead of meeting your bully at the flagpole, you'd just get your severed head nailed to the rostra.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-13 18:12:35	What I'm trying to say is, ancient Romans were dicks.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-10 20:01:05	@CodyTFS gross. Twitter doesn't want to know.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-13 21:50:48	Slc punk! Was a shitty attempt at propaganda by corporate America to relate to us and get us to fall in line. Rise above, rebels!
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-13 21:56:26	Jk but that movie sucked.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-13 22:46:08	She had me at "I like gender roles."
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-13 23:06:38	Hey Kenosha, I'll be home tomorrow for the last time for a long time so let's go see the wonder years in mke.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-13 23:17:44	@ChrisYafchak @alex_sloan I'll order my ticket.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-13 23:21:51	@ChrisYafchak @alex_sloan let me see how much they are. I have to get one for Will so I may not be able to.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-14 00:04:09	This is the first time twitter has been around for a new pope. I pray for better pope puns next time around.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-14 00:44:36	@EmmaMarlar bummer, homie. I'm going at 2:30 or 3:00
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-14 01:13:45	@EmmaMarlar welp, we can ride together if you want to get a voucher for your bus ticket and save some $$
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-14 01:59:17	@PaulSamsen all we are saying is know your place. You have a purpose, and it isn't to fight in the military.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-14 02:13:58	@PaulSamsen oh, you infuriate me. Haha
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-14 02:29:54	@PaulSamsen Make me a SAMmich.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-14 02:31:01	@PaulSamsen luckily for me, girls don't poop. Fuck wit it.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-14 02:32:37	@PaulSamsen So you're going to be picking up someone else's poop? Go for it. Logic of a woman.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-14 04:14:03	@JohnnyXFocused @paulsamsen this is bullshit!
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-14 04:16:17	"Sex McDaniel" favorited my tweet so now I'm giving up and going to sleep.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-10 20:05:23	@stacyfortheday come say hi

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-10 22:18:22	@Stephanie_Sax I think she is trying to access her soul.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-11 01:30:33	I like my girlfriend because she agreed to not argue with me during wrestling on Monday nights.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-11 01:31:50	And because she is nice.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-11 02:23:42	How much do I hate math? Enough to avoid it by drawing myself as a bad guy luchador. http://t.co/4swL8EHhMI
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-14 16:46:50	Here's hoping the twins have a dog shit season so I'll be able to afford going to games.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-14 17:04:55	I promised myself I would try to be more social at parties.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-09 02:47:51	There is a file of me and @CodyTFS doing an attack attack vocal cover and it's up to you to find it. Ready. Set. Go.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-09 04:51:40	@rachelstoebe she's so nice.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-09 04:55:16	@rachelstoebe I talked to her. She said "whaddup?"
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-09 05:03:24	"Wowda melm" is a chant at this party.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-15 02:26:59	@MattToomey haha, hey I'm back for the weekend. I'll try and get you guys some copies!
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-15 02:37:52	@MattToomey will do!
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-15 02:45:07	Well, I'm back in Kenosha. Crap.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-15 03:12:16	@Stephanie_Sax how are you drunk? It's ten.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-15 07:38:50	I'd sleep, but..Dan Andriano in the Emergency Room.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-15 07:53:24	@windyshittykid but it's good to know I'm in good company.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-03-15 07:55:44	@windyshittykid skiba's split with Kevin Seconds is so fucking awesome. Have you heard the new trio single?

"Are you miserable?"
"Can you pull the trigger of a scanner?"

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-05-23 01:29:38	Like, when will any place other than a mall feel like home to me?
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-05-19 01:06:15	I legitimately just had a friendly conversation about mustaches with a fellow mustached man. We complimented each other. It was nice.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-05-29 18:11:08	@BestProAdvice you just recycle the same shit over and over again. Talk about a good account gone bad.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-05-29 00:59:16	@raechelleMN that's awesome. We literally just played that in the store and I thought about our singalongs. Haha

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-06-06 18:35:48	"Weird twitter" is not funny.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-06-06 18:37:44	@MetalMike_Drums I counted only half a gazillion.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-06-06 20:51:14	@ChodyGay is there even a target to aim for with weird twitter?

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-06-10 07:48:10	But mostly I'm just coming to grips with the fact that when I look in the mirror, I see a fucking crazy person.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-06-12 18:29:06	@ChodyGay the D.E.N.N.I.S plan at its finest. Don't forget to separate entirely at the end of it all.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-06-12 18:34:07	Been at the mall for 6 minutes. Sheldon "bazinga" shirt count so far: 3. It's going to be a long day.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-06-12 18:34:48	@ChodyGay THIS GUY. Fuck school. Join my band.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-06-12 18:51:31	I can't spend another month away from there. These frantic rest stop phone calls don't get answered anymore.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-06-13 19:26:19	@Alex_Sloan I guess you haven't leased a place before. It's a contract. You can't just get out of it.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-06-13 08:26:52	@Alex_Sloan yeah. Let me cancel that lease really quick. Good plan!

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-06-15 02:11:15	I just passed the overpass Juno had a mental breakdown under on her way back from St. Cloud.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-06-15 02:58:44	Dear diary: entry #4,000. I feel strange tonight. They still push pit in Minnesota. Not sure how I feel. Will update later.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-06-15 03:29:51	Dear diary: entry 4,001. The Minnesotans are still pushing each other. Unsure of everything right now. They're awfully nice.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-06-15 03:30:20	Side note: a wall of death happened. They used two mattresses on the front lines.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-06-16 07:54:10	I understand we all went away so we could have the stories to share when we're back.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-07-26 01:22:30	@WoahhItsBrooke update: the smothered burrito. Not very good with shredded chicken.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-07-26 01:32:04	@WoahhItsBrooke pretty much everything. Rice, beans, meat, cheese, red sauce, chipotle sauce, and sour cream.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-07-26 16:49:37	I woke up in an absolute panic at 6:00 am afraid I missed work. That's how stressed I am.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-07-28 04:20:38	@grantwill literally only one of those things are true.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-07-28 05:51:45	@clairetworek @raechelleMN good.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-08-02 01:16:49	I know it seems like I'm always upset.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-08-02 01:17:50	Thinking chipotle was a good idea was a bad idea.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-08-02 22:44:37	The wrestling went too far and she got mad. Claire just doesn't have it in her to be a wwe diva.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-11-20 18:41:20	@Alex_Sloan no I'm living with Claire. We can work something out.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-11-25 00:49:42	If there is anything that takes longer than Claire shopping at target, it's Claire shopping at the grocery store.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-11-29 23:03:56	I feel like a nerd for getting an Ecig, but when you can smoke Mountain Dew and not get lung cancer, they're hard to ignore.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-11-30 23:13:30	So I was going to take Claire to this restaurant for her birthday. What answer do I get? That's stupid and I can make it at home. Bust.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-12-06 05:36:51	The closest possible thing to hell is the line at the impound lot on the first day after a snow emergency in Minneapolis.

533467927	blakeapgar	2013-12-19 19:51:39	@bentonsmusic you won the dumbest comment on the internet today. Congratulations.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-12-17 03:27:43	Apparently, in some alternate universe, "I am going to give someone a ride home" really means "I am going to hang out with them for hours."
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-12-19 20:39:09	@bentonsmusic that was a sick burn. Ouch. You really got me. I personally blame George Bush.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-12-19 20:50:58	@bentonsmusic is your account verified because you are a professional idiot, or what?
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-12-19 20:53:16	@bentonsmusic well, surely it isn't #countrycrunk that is getting you recognized.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-12-19 21:01:50	@bentonsmusic ugh, you aren't even fun to troll. They told me I was working with a professional here.
533467927	blakeapgar	2013-12-19 21:05:44	@bentonsmusic there's a formula to what we're doing. I say something witty and mean, then you counter with something witty and mean, pal.

533467927	blakeapgar	2014-03-04 03:56:16	@MetalMike_Drums this has never worked for me. Now that you're internet famous, make me famous. Plz?
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-03-04 04:58:59	If this gets 100 RTs, @MetalMike_Drums will design a graphic of turtles banging and I will get it tattooed on my back. Pics to follow.
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-03-03 19:37:47	A tweet appreciating the fact that "pimp" is no longer used interchangeably with "cool"
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-03-04 04:48:23	@HijackRAW my hatred for triple h is no longer "heat". It's legitimate anger. They are about to lose us.

533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-22 21:48:09	The earlier you realize you will always be wrong but you stop fighting it, the happier you will be. A life lesson.
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-22 20:06:19	Is anyone up for summertime hangin' today?
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-25 16:46:35	There needs to be a fundamental shift in how we cover mass shootings. While vlogs and manifestos are interesting, they're just (cont..)
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-25 16:49:54	(Cont..) remnants of an ego. Rodger knew he'd be glorified. Focus should be put on victims, mental health and gun control. In that order.
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-25 18:46:55	@courtneyeblake I have seen that trend. I found it very thought provoking. It's a conversation that needs to be had. Elliot Rodger is an
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-25 18:48:19	@courtneyeblake extreme case of it. I won't deny it's something live in fear of everyday. But I would venture to say the reason he did
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-25 18:49:27	@courtneyeblake what he did went deeper than just a hatred for women. It's more psychological than anything. I would love to talk about
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-25 18:49:32	@courtneyeblake this not over twitter.
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-27 17:24:08	I firmly believe that having a plan B can muddy up your plan A.
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-29 20:13:36	ALL MEN ARE ELLIOT RODGER. ALL OF EM.
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-29 20:14:49	I just don't get it, but not a single person wants to explain it. They just want to point fingers.
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-29 20:24:03	@Alex_Sloan I am
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-29 20:31:41	@Alex_Sloan as of last night.
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-29 20:33:43	@courtneyeblake I'm not sure a mass shooting is learned behavior. I could be wrong.
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-29 20:54:27	It is mental illness because no one in your life taught you to kill six innocent people. Sane people don't go on shooting rampages.
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-29 20:56:19	I'm just saying that taking the actions of a crazy person and blaming all males for it is a bit of a stretch (kinda dumb)
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-29 22:14:27	@bakeanddestroy serious question: did she announce it to everyone, or what?
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-29 22:48:53	@bakeanddestroy I don't think it does. I don't know why you have to be so defensive. I was curious how you knew she was running from a man.
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-05-29 22:55:35	@bakeanddestroy I didn't assume anyone was lying. It was an innocent question. There's no need for your hostility.
533467927	blakeapgar	2014-06-01 02:42:57	@grantwill yeah man. The eavesdropping comes in handy at times.

533467927	blakeapgar	2015-04-24 17:29:00	I think I got knocked on my bottom again.

533467927	blakeapgar	2015-04-29 04:01:03	I shaved my face. What's the worst decision you've made today?

533467927	blakeapgar	2015-05-07 05:10:36	I don't ever want to go to work or school. I just want to watch baseball.
