535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-07 22:44:01	@UrbanskiRyan @McDonalds it throws off my whole day tho
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-07 22:49:28	A big S/O to the gangsters . Sagging your shorts lower when it's cold was a genius idea
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-08 19:49:02	But sometimes I just don't know what I do
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-09 07:30:10	I wanted a smile
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-09 18:27:36	I'm so fucking tired

535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-12 11:32:56	It's really not even that cold tho
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-12 23:26:29	That's exactly what i didn't want
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-15 21:16:19	How come when I'm stuck in traffic every other lane goes faster than me
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-18 11:46:28	I'm going to try being better
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-14 20:17:21	Best part about lifting is I can go in my own world
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-18 22:28:58	God damn it
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-16 16:32:40	Throwing my cards on the table because I'm out

535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-20 20:29:13	Being in the military and listening to lay me down makes everything real
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-23 17:09:17	It was all real, it still is, it always will be.
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-23 17:09:49	I'll break every fucking mirror
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-23 17:11:50	There will be the hypocrites, and they will know who they are
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-23 17:15:33	All the plans gone, all my money gone, left with a ring with no hand and a heart with no love
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-23 17:23:35	My doors open, come over
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-23 22:39:49	@elle_renae please stop,

535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-24 13:20:18	You're a two faced bitch, don't ever fucking think any of it will be okay
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-24 13:50:33	I Just broke my toes
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-24 12:43:11	That's the worst..

535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-24 15:04:18	Don't be sorry
535649008	CameronDLucas	2013-11-24 15:11:15	Never mind
