535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-09-21 12:28:09	How can van gaal be sooo wiched? Unleashing di_maria, rooney, van_persie nd falcao all on just mere leicester?
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-09-21 14:51:15	Hard luck
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-09-22 12:52:47	Things movin in da wrong direction shall  move in da wrong direction unless an external force, which in dis case, our defence acts upon it.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-09-22 12:55:31	I suppose falcao had a fantastic game yesterday, save his ball that hit da cross bar. It was a superb volley nd think it shld have scored
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-09-22 12:28:52	I wonder why a coach can sit comfortably on his chair not going to the touch line to command his players when things are going wrong.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-09-22 12:30:50	If u feel soo big, u can ask gigs to take up dat responsibility so as to motivate da boys on the touchline.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-09-22 12:44:22	Noo one tends to annoy me much as how van gaal does

535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-10-25 12:36:09	I think @man utd must hire tony_pulis as one of the training coaches nd be given charge over working toward a hard defensive setup

535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-11-20 16:21:18	Breaking - Man_utd has agreed a deal to sign Usain Bolt on a 6month deal since they need some physicality in the team
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-11-22 16:49:28	No creativity in the united team today too
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-11-22 20:43:01	Bcos united won, every1 seem to 4get abt di-maria's miss. It was horrible. A player of such quality nd price tag shld hit da back of the net
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-11-30 02:15:23	@utd_tonmoy it was only a blip
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-12-02 19:42:12	Let's give dis niggas a whooping 4-0. Man_utd all the way
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-12-06 18:08:43	How can blue be invincible? Der's no way. Dey re now visible, hahaaaaaaa
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-12-20 14:05:39	Where's Herrera?
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-12-20 18:26:47	In a match in which u need goals, it'll ave been beter to keep v.persie who can guarantee u goals wen chances re crated than bring on Wilson
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-12-22 09:26:13	I think da problem with man_utd is da slow transition from defence to attack. Allows opponents to regroup which makes it difficult 4 them
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-12-26 11:57:42	I remember that boxing day 7 goals thriller against newcastle which was finally determined by a last minute gaol by chicharito
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-12-28 10:48:59	I may sound as a Hippocrate but is da truth. I wish city n Chelsea looses today while united wins or probably, a win 4 city tooo.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2014-12-28 11:37:02	A falcao winner will do me a great joy n end da year in style for me
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-01-07 10:14:37	I think mcfc want to sign bony becos of the impact of his fellow Ivorian at the etihad
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-01-10 09:03:37	If united signs a player, i wish they could get into the lineup immediately n help the team out but that's not the case with Valdez;
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-01-12 09:01:53	I have my doubts abt LVG's tactics. His tactical changes re really poor. Dnt really know wat to do to change games.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-01-18 03:07:44	It hurts to be watching man_utd n chelsea play simultaneously but to watch chelsea play a better game as man_utd performs terribly.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-01-23 17:57:54	U can hav ur problems with A. Gyan but the harsh truth is he'll always put smiles on the f@ce of Ghanaians
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-01-30 09:48:24	If man_utd are not preparing bid, dey are ready to bid for so so and so player. Just as arsenal in the past, we're being linked with over
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-01-30 09:49:45	1000 players in a single Transfer window
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-01-30 10:01:32	Wat is see is utd making a bid for Laporte on deadline day bt not meeting da buyout clause knowing bilbao will not sell if clause is not met
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-01-30 10:02:27	They'll come back ro tell us an imposter trie ro sign him just as the case with then Herrera
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-01-30 18:07:57	If man_utd were to be a girl nd my gf, i would have probably changed her by now bt since it's difficult to change a club, I'll stick by dem
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-01-31 16:03:48	I think this performance from da man_utd boys hav bought ed-woodward and van-gaal tickets to no transfer activities dis window
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-02 19:07:03	B. Munich must be shivering now that vfl wolvesburg has shurlle and de-bruyne.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-01-31 23:32:59	Di-maria actually enjoyed himself today, save the goal he missed. Shld have probably slided it on to Wilson
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-03 04:26:55	"@trevhrd: This kellet deal makes no sense" they trying to compensate us

535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-02 17:45:23	I luv Manchester united. I always had;
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-03 19:14:42	I pitty @AnderHerrera , honestly. If he can't even get a starting berth against Cambridge, i wonder wen he's going to get a start
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-03 21:06:44	Rafael's position must be in jeopardy it seems. As it stands, Paddy can only be compared to S. Coleman
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-07 06:46:32	How i find it funny for someone to retweet his own tweet jxt a few moment after tweeting; hahaaaa;

535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-07 22:08:25	Honestly, i don't see cuadrado getting more game time ahead of willian. Willian's work rate on and off the ball is unparallel
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-07 21:40:39	Couldn't hide my joy after B. Dortmund were comfortably 3-0 winners today. A relief at last.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-08 22:44:57	Dede crying, that was very selfish of him. Wanting to play the last kick to win the game, whiles u could win from start by playing fisrst
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-08 22:47:12	Dnt actually know why u leave one of ur best penalty kick takers to play last while u already have an advantage of two kick
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-08 22:52:42	What more did Ghana expect from ivory coast? After dashing u first two spot kick? Da boys actually fucked up
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-08 22:53:57	He who laughs last, laughs the best. That's da way it is and the way it's going to be
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-08 18:15:35	A late equaliser from @blind_daley makes up for his poor performance today;
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-09 19:57:58	If he wants out, who the hell gives a fuck about it? He shld jst pack his stuffs n go;
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-09 19:59:36	like seriously, i live in a terrible country;
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-08 19:34:36	Unfortunate for atsu's ball to not enter da net
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-11 22:01:50	Chelsea fans can now make that stupid argument btwm Czech v courtious. Who's better;
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-11 23:27:22	I commend wenger 4 not selling us vaemaleen. With da way things re going, Lvg wld hav been crucified to death for buying an injured player.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-11 23:27:34	I think thats why he sold them a world class striker in D. Welbeck as sign of appreciation
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-12 12:43:22	@TheMUFCVoice. With that, we should be winning the league
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-11 11:51:57	I rember somewhere in December wen Rooney exelled really well in dat midfield position, scoring some wonderful goals fron deep
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-11 11:53:05	This same media wad praisinghim and labelling him as the new replacement of scholes. What happened to that?
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-11 18:17:13	I dnt think anyone will ever get lvg's starting 11 right,
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-14 07:18:58	Hapi vals day to u all 💐💐💐💐💐💐
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-14 14:51:21	@United__Updates  the thing os, people can't just stop talking about man_utd, can they? That's how big the club we support is
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-18 08:52:11	@bensmith130 @trevhrd . One thing u need to understand is, chelsea is a small club and people don't have time, ever, for small clubs.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-21 17:47:05	I thnk its about time di maria steps up to justify the sum of money paid up for him else.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-23 23:14:10	Seems lyk lvg's training methods, formation and philosophy made di Maria 4get abt how to dribble nd Rooney, rvp nd Falcao 4get how to score.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-25 15:25:59	@itweet_mufc @theunitedview  it can only exist in a dream
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-28 06:34:25	One thing i believe in is, should u get ur chance, take it and this guy takes his chances whenever he gets it. Love u http://t.co/QJ9tA3VG6B
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-28 10:55:57	Miss da feeling of a solid performance wid 5 goals frm utd &amp;  striker bagging a hat trick. Hope it happns 2day with Falcao da hat trick hero
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-28 14:14:43	Back to 3-5-2
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-28 14:40:09	Feeling tired, perhaps he played champions league on Tuesday nd eroupa league on Thursday. Hahaaaaaaaa
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-02-28 11:03:53	@TurtleToucher57 yea but then it came from a result of terrible performance though we won.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-02 17:45:10	If Barcelona are willing to sell Pedro, i think man_utd shld go for him. He'll do a pretty good job on da right side of our attack.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-04 22:17:18	Someone remember me. Is this our first double of the season?
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-06 13:45:38	@United__Updates. U're right. I would have slapped him n take a ban if it were to be me he spat on
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-07 20:29:07	@itweet_mufc @carrick_fan, dats wat happens wen u chase every player the media hypes. Jxt like chasing every girl in mini skirt.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-08 11:32:26	Wld u prefer beating arsenal to da fa cup glory and loose out to them on 4th place or otherwise?
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-09 19:43:25	Remember when the draw for quarter finals was made? It was man_utd (8) vrs arsenal (2). What does that reminds u of?
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-09 03:44:41	I thought Rooney made v Persie at united last season. Jxt play Rooney n Falcao foward. Every ball, give it to Rooney n he'll assist Falcao
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-10 06:28:23	I hate him more that, I'll love to see him being sacked
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-10 06:29:14	No explanation 4 what he did
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-10 06:29:47	We shouldn't allow him to go scot free
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-09 22:16:38	I remember tweeting abt how suspicious lvg's substitution is. He never gets it right
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-12 09:08:35	It's only a matter of time Chelsea realises man_city are snatching the epl from their grasp.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-13 11:24:59	@Jamesstretford, bt then James, we all saw a bit how good jones was under saf. Particularly being a role player.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-13 11:26:57	@SkySportsNewsHQ its a mixed seasons bt not soo many good games
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-13 18:15:38	@Jamesstretford add up to a brilliant performance in that last game
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-13 18:23:43	@DarrenHazza Darren, i even love it more wen he plays alongside Herrera
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-15 15:33:08	Come on boys,let's close up to da top
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-15 16:55:02	@TheRedDevilinho say dat again. Ave been wonderin al season wen we're goin to score such goals during first 45 mins &amp; i thnk it's a g8t half
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-15 19:35:42	@itweet_mufc i think matta is one of the most loved in the dressing room. Ave always loved him
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-15 20:13:12	with much expectations, united will go to Liverpool nxt week &amp; perform terribly with a loss
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-19 23:56:31	@Jamesstretford they actually do
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-20 00:39:16	@Jamesstretford i mean Europe
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-22 12:21:52	Ggggggggggg mufc
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-23 17:32:09	Saf has done his part. It's the turn of lvg and us to make sure the young fans growing up never remembers wen Liverpool were successful;
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-03-27 21:21:07	@UtdBal @trevhrd it's because man_utd is not even using them
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-03 14:43:59	@rosieferrer say that again. He's soo lovely n the nicest guy in da dressing room right now. That's my opinion tho
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-04 14:02:01	About a year ago, who would have thought fellaini and young would get a start ahead of falcao and di-maria in the same team?
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-04 14:29:53	A class of pass from Herrera
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-06 19:59:00	@DarrenHazza i can't actually believe u saying that, as we wish united to win it instead
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-06 20:03:07	A loss for city today and Sunday and we're guaranteed 3rd no matter da outcome of the chelsea game
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-06 20:05:35	@UtdMads @utd_tonmoy hahaaaa. Be ready to do that
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-06 20:08:27	@DarrenHazza actually didn't get u well at first but i get u now
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-07 09:19:46	@BusbyMUFC where from that rumour? I think perhaps ur right; they trying to buy his blog, 'one hour behind'.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-07 09:23:22	Happy Crystal palace day to all man utd fans
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-07 09:41:10	@ProudRed85 @Jamesstretford perhaps they adding dat to Eriksson nd Kane
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-10 17:42:01	Maradona on lvg labeling him closer to da devil for not playing falcao is a stupid talk. Why not label mourinho as such 4 not playn cuadrado
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-10 17:42:39	Da guy is having a difficult season and we must understand that
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-10 17:42:59	How many times haven't we seen falcao being played and not performing. The last thing united cannot afford now is bad performances
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-11 16:15:27	@rosieferrer i'd rather someone who hated football but unfortunately, my gf supports Chelsea. Can u imagine that @rosie?
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-11 17:30:58	@rosieferrer say that again bt the thing is, she doesn't like ball soo much.
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-18 09:26:11	We need to outscore them. On a gud day, Chelsea will bag 2 goals so wee need 3;
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-17 20:57:42	@jonmikesav8 I'll love that bt will love nothing more than Falcao coming on to score a late winner
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-17 21:03:22	I'll personally play di maria in that Carrick role
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-18 22:15:59	Getting to da end of da 1st half of da season, i really had doubts as to whether lvg was the right man to bring success back to old trafford
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-18 22:16:19	Am now totally convinced he is
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-18 22:20:49	Allowing januzaj go on loan at bilbao will help his development. Bring Chicharito bak nxt season and he'll be better as a sub. He accepts it
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-18 22:45:00	@SGCW7 @SteevyKim i agree with u. Sum1 who doesn't care how terribly his team played at home. Utd fans are not used to terrible performances
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-18 22:46:07	@kpsundayworld @itweet_mufc he couldn't have said it any better
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-21 01:20:09	I luv man_utd and everyone in the united family
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-20 19:57:38	@trevhrd did it occur 2 u he culd becum what he is today? Is jxt like letting ur girl go  n later gettn to know she is manager of world bank
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-20 20:00:53	@Jamesstretford say that again. How i wished he wld come on for Falcao last Saturday against Chelsea
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-21 00:05:32	@trevhrd i would hav wished we still hav him tho
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-22 07:30:16	@Jamesstretford James, i think the lad has improved massively after the mistake frm the first leg of the derby
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-23 06:56:47	@DarrenHazza i think that was a payback after he gave Ronaldo an assist last weekend and Ronaldo refused to celebrate with him
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-23 06:59:08	@mediocentroEN @Obeyfaruk it's really a disaster to other epl teams cos even when united were not spending, they still won trophies
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-22 18:39:57	@Sigodi @RedMancunian if fellaini is da beast, he'll be theokoles
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-04-24 23:15:53	I dnt need to be told of. Man_utd has always been a shit club. That's the main reason we started supporting them and we have no regrets;
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-05-03 19:03:25	@Jamesstretford ur right @james
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-05-03 19:17:14	Imagine playing this, ddg, clyne, hummels, laporte/jones/smalling, blind, carrick, gondugan/herrera, depay, mata, di-marai and rooney
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-05-03 19:20:12	@RFFH @petersydenham i being a united fan was particularly happy with him giving out that condolence
535656435	DENMORDEY	2015-05-06 15:40:54	@Jamesstretford he's being paid a lot of money so he needs to concentrate on his job
