54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-02 21:26:59	@AudraArenas you need to invest in some vitamin E and C stat.  You better not get sick again.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-03 20:27:22	@Painz who said I hadn't already got my drank on?  Just a small one though, so I am not even buzzed. More to come!

54436265	itsrynie	2009-08-14 14:18:57	Why is it when you make plans, everything that could go wrong, goes wrong?
54436265	itsrynie	2009-08-18 01:41:06	Why when I left this morning Starz was showing #21, and when I came home at 8 pm, same movie??
54436265	itsrynie	2009-08-19 18:19:44	@Mia it is way too early for you to be up!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-08-22 19:28:00	Dear matchy matchy couple at Wal-Mart, the look is not working for you!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-08-23 03:20:21	Curled up on the couch and watching #Scream. Why did they have to ruin it with the sub par sequels???

54436265	itsrynie	2009-09-15 14:49:48	why can't my Dr say "Since you have CTS, you must stay at home and rest your wrists"??
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-08 23:34:27	@Painz I may work tomorrow, so my drank may have to stay in the freezer for one more day.

54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-11 00:43:38	Really Texas?  55 deg in mid October, unheard of.  However, keep it up as I am enjoying it!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-13 18:04:59	OH at work "I didn't know Bath and Body Works sells stuff for your skin". Oh really, where do you put their lotion?
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-18 23:02:33	Kroger why do you make it so difficult to find breadcrumbs. I swear I walked around the store I will just make my own then, probably cheaper
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-19 01:28:51	"What do they call you, Wheels?"
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-19 12:40:04	This time of day should be outlawed. I am beyond tired, wish I worked from home. Since it is not a possibility I will head into work.

54436265	itsrynie	2009-09-21 01:23:16	I guess the wait was well worth it, since I got a Pomegranate 7-UP cake out of it. Now I can go lay down.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-09-21 14:58:57	I think the pharmacy tried to have its wicked way with me. $105 for one 30 day supply of meds. I said NO.

54436265	itsrynie	2009-09-26 03:26:05	OMG Showtime is playing Earth Girls Are Easy. I haven't seen this in ages.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-09-27 00:24:10	Why does a girl need 42 bottles of nail polish? I don't know the answer to this, but I am said girl.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-09-27 04:49:01	Why don't I have Scream on DVD? I know there are better horror movies out there, but it is pretty awesome.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-09-28 21:13:56	internet no workie. Sitting in the parking lot at Starbucks and completing the downloads on my songs I bought last week
54436265	itsrynie	2009-09-28 21:14:49	@Mia I don't know about that. Not really a big Jake fan period.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-09-28 21:18:10	@Mia he seems right up your alley, cute in a geeky/dorky way.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-09-28 23:13:02	Tired of laying around all day with a migraine, so I made some Pecan Pie Cookies. YUMMY!

54436265	itsrynie	2009-09-29 19:03:32	PS- I don't feel like doing any of this, my meds have made me very sleepy. I am way too nice.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-01 23:34:03	@Mia like I am actually at my desk working! Will do
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-03 17:11:16	I am wide awake and not sure what I am going to do with my day today. I know I have cookies to bake, but that doesn't take all day.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-03 23:38:41	@Mia I think #Mothra would approve.  Watching Under Siege, Segal is kicking major ass.

54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-05 02:45:38	@Mia nope found a new one. Think NOMS, really nerdy, short black curly hair. Initials are HS
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-05 20:37:45	@AudraArenas watch out or I might be able to give it to you, before you can give it to me. We shall see.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-05 22:48:05	I still don't know WTF I have. However it is like 20 deg in here. Can you hurry the fuck up?
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-23 01:15:37	@Mia has been suspended! Can there be a Twitter with out @Mia? #freemia
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-24 05:08:49	@Mia I would answer a phone, if it rang
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-31 02:22:31	I know it sound dorky, but our Oct'O Mom pumpkin we made at work, won 2nd place in the carving contest. We didn't even carve, all paint!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-08 19:51:28	finds it quite funny that a character in this Japanese Horror movie I am watching, is wearing a Gilley's t-shirt.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-10 01:44:31	@Painz I have been hiding under a rock. Been sick off and on for the last month, and have really neglected the Twitter
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-10 01:49:19	I do not live and breathe to respond to emails. I work 10-12 hours a day. By the time I get home, I have maybe 3 hours before I go to bed.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-10 01:55:54	Thanks @lolah that is very sweet! That Coach would make me feel really better, so I am going to keep it in the back of mind
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-10 14:45:33	Needless to say, my FB friend is still being annoying. I am going to ignore her until I feel better, then maybe I won't be such a bitch
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-10 01:46:26	I am sick, so that is probably effecting my mood, but people are just pissing me off lately.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-10 01:51:20	Ok, I am done with my rant! It is not directed at anyone of my Twitter friends, someone from FB, so I obviously can not rant on there
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-10 14:44:33	@Painz a Coach Hobo would be so nice. However, looks like I will be treking back to the Dr. So $$ is going to have to be for him and Rx's.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-10 14:46:16	stuck at home today. Feel terrible. Like how my Dr can not see me until 3:30, I guess I should be thankful he can see me today at all
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-15 04:17:53	@Painz I am glad your Gram is doing better. I hope she continues to improve!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-20 06:14:50	Ready for a girls night out tomorrow, even if I am not crazy about some of the girls I am going out with.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-20 22:56:15	Totalling Dorking out tonight. Seeing New Moon and having some drinks with the Ladies.

54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-12 01:56:00	James Avery is really  tempting me with this Amethyst ring. I might have to buy it as a Christmas gift for myself.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-12 02:14:56	@Mia @Painz and I have connected. I have been advised to lay off the cough syrup
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-12 02:15:30	@Mia BTW I found a Halloween card I was going to send you. It has a stamp on it and all. I guess through all the sickness it didn't make it
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-12 02:22:54	@Mia whatever keeps us amused!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-14 00:53:18	@Painz HA! Trust me they are just fine as is!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-14 04:05:19	@Mia. Ok! Do you think the cupcakes will travel there well? I think if you want them that bad, U will have to swing by Texas and pick em up
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-14 04:50:14	@Mia for Saltgrass, I think the trip would be worth it!

54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-16 01:50:13	Just ordered pizza and wings. The last time I ordered a pizza I lived with @Mia. For those keeping track, that has been almost 2 years.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-17 17:42:19	To quote the Great Oz "I'm going off the rails on a crazy train"
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-17 21:13:08	Why do I live in the only bi-polar state in the US?
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-07 03:49:49	@Mia L'Oreal has a new limited addition nail color, I think you would like. It is Hopeful Plum, not as pretty as the other one u liked

54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-24 12:37:35	It is way to fucking early to be up, been up for the last hour. I need a diet coke stat.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-26 22:09:12	How does my sister believe the Mayans are from their own planet?
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-29 04:48:37	@Mia DAMN! Is it too late too late to have her labeled "Return to Sender"???
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-03 00:24:14	@Mia I am so jelis, since we never made it to Kings Hawaiian when I was out
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-03 23:57:32	@Mia Dr. Roy. Looking as cute as ever. Although I prefer Dustin, the new hygenist.

54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-24 12:40:28	@LoniLove was going to say something about Chelsea not taking you down under, but looks like your fans got that covered!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-24 16:01:39	to the person at work who stole my powder compact...... you are GROSS!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-26 22:11:53	Oh my jebus. My sister says that in order to not die in 2012, we are going to have to go to space. I have no words.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-28 22:49:21	I am feeling a little safer now, think I will venture out to the store
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-29 07:38:46	My wrist has been bothering my since Thursday. Wish I had something stronger for the pain. Excedrin Extra Strength is not cutting it!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-03 22:39:35	@Mia I just visited your favorite person evah!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-04 13:34:25	@Mia you and @dhlawrencexvii are either up way too late, or way too early! Stop, it is freaking me out.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-04 16:01:41	@lolah I am thinking must have it set up on a timer or something.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-05 03:46:45	but that is ok, we will be boozing it up the whole time.  That makes up for the lack of sleeping in late
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-05 05:19:55	@Painz shut off the computer now, no more researching 2012. I don't want you to turn into a raving lunatic like my sister
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-06 07:57:08	@Mia NO! Dis is Waffles, I have taken control of the entire house and booted some Pomeranian bitches out
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-07 21:08:40	@Mia please enjoy this last day. After today I plan on enjoying the next 2 months and 1 day!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-08 00:57:13	@Mia keep planting poinsettas until the 29th, and you will keep leveling up faster
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-08 15:51:35	@Mia Happy B Day BB! I would send a text, but I don't feel like being shanked/shived today!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-09 20:56:57	@Mia how does it feel?
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-13 05:15:11	Watching my DVD of HP and The Half Blood Prince. Haven't seen it since the opening night of the movie. Still my fav one so far!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-13 21:03:36	@Painz where you at? Did you fall off the face of the planet again?
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-13 21:15:32	WOW, it is 12/13 and it is 77 in Texas. Very nice after all that yucky cold weather.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-15 03:27:40	@Mia I thought you got that shit with the bank straightened out months ago?
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-20 01:47:45	@Mia I am with you. This iced tea is not cutting it. I need soda now! Although nothing is really stopping me from getting it, except for me
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-21 01:18:13	it is 7:17, and I was supposed to leave work 17 minutes ago!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-21 01:32:07	I finally get to go home
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-21 13:45:29	@AudraArenas someone got stuck on the phone with a client, and since I was the MOD last night I had to stay.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-21 13:46:09	@AudraArenas plus that gave me time to fail your friend across the way
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-21 13:46:38	@texcanditown please my ass is going to take me time coming in this morning.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-21 21:04:53	@audraarenas I have no CLUE who I am speaking of!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-24 04:39:58	Patience was never my virtue. I want my new glasses and sunglasses now! Instead I have to wait 3 weeks. BOO!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-24 05:10:17	I guess having to wait that long means, they will more of a birthday present
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-11 04:33:22	pretty sure that I have a stalker that only stalks on FB and text messages to my phone. Geez, give me a break!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-12 23:13:06	@Mia why now, why not wait until the New Year and make it your resolution? That way you have 3 weeks to slowly break it off with Coke.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-13 05:37:03	If you have plans to hang out with someone you really don't want to, and they have not finalized the plans, do you remind them? I say NO.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-13 21:07:15	said person remembered plans. SHIT. I am now chilling in the HC.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-15 03:26:24	baby shower on Sunday for an old friend I haven't seen in years. How do I get myself into these things?
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-15 03:31:50	@Mia I am way too nice! I feel bad if I say no. Plus it is always fun to shop for bb clothes.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-16 13:33:00	"The Solution" best/funniest thing I heard all night.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-10-31 02:21:47	Busy week, trying to shake this sickness, and it is not letting go
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-10 01:47:40	If I don't respond to your email, please do not send me another one, asking if I am ignoring you. I am now!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-10 01:50:26	and less than 10 hours before I have to get up and do it all over again. If it is not life or death, I will respond when I can
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-10 21:21:39	I know I am at the Dr and there are sickies here, but this lady hacking up her lung is pissing me off.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-11 21:38:14	I have realized that when I am sick, I turn into a real BITCH
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-13 04:47:58	Umm ok, according to this email I just received, I can afford better breasts. Really?
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-15 04:17:07	@Mia Thick and Hearty is back! Sad news, it goes away forever on 12/21. That can be your b-day present. I will FedEx you like 10
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-21 04:34:35	@Mia very nice. I will have to check it out, before I shop for Turkey Day. Holly is supposed to show up, so this will be very interesting
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-24 12:38:24	Got to go to work an attend the "I'm sorry, but we have sold your department, now fuck off" meeting. Should be fun!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-28 01:37:24	at the Dr right now. Trying to determine what strain of Ebola I have
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-05 17:02:47	Success is mine! Just purchased my tickets for the added Bon Jovi show in Dallas!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-05 18:01:14	Just ate a bowl of Cheerios with fresh strawberries and blueberries. Funny thing, I don't like strawberries or blueberries.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-06 02:17:05	Some guy just tried to "pick me up" in Marshall's! It was EPIC
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-06 02:18:41	@Painz hasn't been that long for me, just since 06. However I missed them in 08. I would have loved to see them back in the day!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-06 04:44:50	@Painz NO!!! He was way too stalkerish. He followed me around the whole store, and his great pick up line "Hello, I really like you"!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-06 05:08:51	@Mia Ummmmmmmmm No.  Not my type at all. The whole incident was hilarious, and the last thing he said "I hope I see you again soon" CREEPY
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-06 05:09:40	@Mia although if he had offered to pay for purchases, things might have gone differently for him!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-06 05:21:36	@Mia not at all. He seemed nice, but I got this creepy vibe from him, and I wouldn't have been surprised if he followed me to Target
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-06 06:48:48	@Painz just try to not make it so obvious next time. You need to be more stealth
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-06 16:39:23	Celebrating early, getting ready for my birthday lunch with friends and family. Only 4 more days till the actual big day!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-07 01:13:17	Just expected to spend the day with some good friends and that is it. My friends are too generous, and got tons of presents. SO SWEET!!!!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-07 03:23:06	Off to put the new comforter set on the bed. Un-fun part, moving the mattress, so I can put on the bedskirt. Hopefully I don't kill myself.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-07 07:13:52	found pics of my high school self on someone's face book that I went to school with, but didn't really know. CRAZY
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-25 12:25:34	I again find myself up at this ungodly hour! Oh well, get off work early today and am off the rest of the week. I guess it is worth it!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-26 22:04:45	My head hurts. My fam is trying to figure out how many millions equal 1 billion.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-27 04:37:19	@Mia HA learned some stuff today, that makes lil bro look like a saint! Didn't realize I had such a soap opera in my own family
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-29 04:53:47	The stores are now stocking the Pomegranate 7UP, and this year they have decided to make it Antioxidant. Already got my first bottle.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-11-29 22:37:34	Watching "Turbulence". Why can't I ever be on a flight with only 11 passengers?
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-01 02:19:04	@Mia even if you were going to #LeWeb, I could not allow it. At least not with out my presence.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-01 02:22:16	waking up, opening your eyes, to find a dog leaning over you and staring at you like your a pork chop = so not COOL.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-01 02:29:08	@Painz it was good. Minus my crazy sister talking about Mayans, 2012 and the family going to space to avoid the end of the world.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-04 19:35:29	it snowed on Wed and is supposed to snow today. It doesn't look like it will. I am so sad!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-07 23:31:17	Watching the Superbowl and rooting for the Saints!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-08 01:06:32	Snooze. Wake me up when the half time show is over.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-08 02:48:21	Who Dat!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-09 06:27:46	Since it is after midnight, it is officially my birthday! Although as my Mother would say it is not technically my birthday until 3:42 PM
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-10 01:03:48	I have to go back to work tomorrow, BOO! Only good thing about it, is I only have to work tomorrow and Thursday.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-05 00:19:10	@lolah that was too funny! I probably shouldn't have read it at work, now they think I am really crazy.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-05 03:13:51	@Painz not that my sister would ever read this, but please don't encourage her!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-05 03:44:51	I am going to be the good friend that I am tomorrow, and go help a friend clean/organize her Mom's house, before they put it up for sale
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-05 03:46:06	I have to be there at 11am, so I am going to get up at 9am. No sleeping in for me tomorrow.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-05 05:18:53	@Mia I have to have some kind of priorities, and as I see it sleep and booze should be up at the top, anything else must come last
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-05 16:03:58	blowdrying my hair and I can't tell if it is still wet, or just cold since I turned the heater off.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-06 07:49:53	if someone send me a text asking if I am still up, do you think I would give the game away if I responded back "NO"?
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-08 00:40:17	@Mia I will when I get home. What is up with you and the FV? I thought it was ridic?
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-12 23:19:22	@Mia more power to you! I am too deep into my addiction to give it up. You will have to take me on Intervention to give up my diet coke.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-13 05:16:47	Totally forgot what an amazing performance @TomFelton gave! To make you actually care for a character you hated since the 1st movie, Genius!
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-13 21:08:43	@Mia have you kicked your piggy flu yet?
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-14 15:52:26	@lolah I really think they are trying to fuck with our heads
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-15 03:30:32	Drink for the night downed, now time for bed. Have to try and get up on time and not be late.
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-15 03:32:38	@Mia should I tell Katie you send her love???? HAHA
54436265	itsrynie	2009-12-21 14:20:02	@Mia do you really want your Mommy? Cause that can be arranged.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-11 04:33:02	I need to go hunting this weekend for throw pillows to go with my new comforter set. It is going to be such a "WILD" weekend.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-11 04:34:23	It is amazing how domesticated my life can be sometimes for someone who is single and has no bb's.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-11 13:25:55	There is snow every where I look. Headed into work, BOO! Off tomorrow though, YEAH!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-12 02:24:48	Can't believe all this snow. It has been snowing non stop since about 2 am this morning. It is so foreign to us in Texas, but I love it!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-13 07:33:29	So far I am not impressed with Zombie's Halloween II. Let's hope that changes
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-13 20:32:56	@Painz. Yes we have snow and it is ridiculous! We got at least a foot if not more, and it has yet to completely melt.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-13 20:34:25	@Painz although when you aren't used to it, it really is beautiful and magical. I don't think I could handle it on a daily basis
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-13 20:35:44	Quite happy that Halloween II got better, and that first part was just a dream sequence. I will have to watch it again today.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-13 20:36:26	Heading out into the frozen tundra. I feel the urge to cook and bake, so I must get supplies from the store.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-13 20:37:13	I have cookies, cupcakes, soups and grilled cheese in my future today. Will be putting the kitchen to some use today.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-14 00:59:53	Tomato soup and grilled cheese made. Cheesecake Cupcakes are in the oven now. Don't know if I am going to have the energy to make cookies
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-14 01:01:24	Mom is still sick so they couldn't come out today so we could have my birthday lunch. Dad said he is going to come out tomorrow by himself.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-14 01:02:01	that means I get to have a Valentine's Day lunch with my Daddy. How sweet is that?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-14 01:08:56	@Mia he is a good Dad! I guess I will have to keep him.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-14 01:09:30	@Mia yes, I sent you an email like years ago and told you what dates I thought would be the best.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-14 02:15:12	@Mia resent it BB.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-14 08:36:18	Why can't I fall asleep? I am so tired and my eye lids are so heavy. And if this mother f'n cat jumps on my bed one more time
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-15 03:00:10	Had to skip out on lunch today with Dad. Woke up after only getting a few hours of sleep, to a raging headache. I have been really lazy 2day
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-16 02:27:32	tried to buy out Bath and Body Works tonight, but I had to be a good girl. I put most of the stuff back. Just bought 8 wallflowers.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-15 23:09:31	Just saw this kid at HPB punch out a comic book with Magneto in it. Then exclaim "OH, I hate Magneto"! Way too involved in X-Men buddy!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-15 23:12:28	My new goal in life, is to collect different copies of Pride and Prejudice. Why? Because I can! 2 now, let's see how many more I can get
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-16 17:57:05	I have no control. I just found a magenta colander on overstock.com and I so want it. Then I could get rid of my cheapie plastic one
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-19 04:19:31	Just from the previews, I think I have figured out  Shutter Island. Only time will tell if I am right
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-19 05:22:45	@Mia can you get on that, like right now?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-19 19:00:57	I got my hair cutted y'all!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-19 23:25:43	I just picked up my new glasses on Tues and guess what I am doing now??? Buying another pair of glasses.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-19 23:26:26	@Painz you on FB? That is where I upload all my pics to.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-20 05:48:46	In the last two days I have bought 6 bottles of nail polish. 3 of 6 are must haves that I have been trying to track down forever.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-20 05:49:08	Now if I can just find the last one that I am looking for, and I will be a happy camper
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-21 04:02:37	painting my nails with OPI's Jade is the New Black. Very pretty dark green shade.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-22 03:07:19	very impressed with my order from #eightyeightbeauty. First time I ordered nail polish by mail, and was worried the bottles would break.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-22 03:27:05	@Mia I know how to use a hashtag, I generally just choose not to
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-22 22:38:14	@Mia GAG. You are just too syrupy sweet. Get a room!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-23 00:36:21	@Mia it does offer me some entertainment/amusement
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-23 02:17:08	Found a cupcake place I am totally going to have to check out while I am in CA this summer
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-23 02:25:39	@Mia hopefully it is Yummy Cupcakes, cause that is the one I want to visit!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-23 02:30:15	@Mia you should see the website! I think I am drooling. If I lived there I would be having a different one every day!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-23 02:37:42	@Mia let me know, but if they are delicious don't rub it in too much. I still have 5 months to wait.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-27 01:40:20	Note to self: when your throat hurts, choosing croutons to eat with your potato soup is not the best option. Can we say OUCH?!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-27 04:19:09	Need to go to bed now, but don't want to. Who the fuck has lunch and drinks at 10am on a Saturday morning? That would be my friends!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-27 17:57:48	I feel like getting up to no good today. The question is, who am I going to get up to no good with??? Must hit the phone/address book
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-27 00:11:25	been at home sick all day, no FUN
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-27 00:12:08	although I did venture to the grocery store, but when I felt like throwing up on the cashier, I ran straight home
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-27 00:16:09	@Mia I may be totally sick to my stomach, but what happened to my Chrimus Trash?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-27 03:08:35	My Maverick is an old lady today. She is now 8
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-28 21:56:14	sitting in the ER on Dr's orders waiting to be seen.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-28 23:28:04	@Mia at the ER right now. Dr called at work and told me to get to ER ASAP
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-28 23:39:51	@Mia the Dr thinks I might have acidosis.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-01 13:11:19	@Mia if we were on the same time zone, 12am on a Sunday night is still too late.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-01 13:12:03	@Mia will be home all day today, so call whenever.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-01 21:41:30	Watching some E! plastic surgery thing. The before and after pics of Mickey Rourke are just painful to see. Not the same man at ALL!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-02 00:33:27	@Mia can you call my Boss and let her know the news?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-02 00:35:05	Loving my new limited addition red swiffer sweeper. Had a hard time picking the red over the pink one.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-02 00:36:56	BTW it is close to Easter. Know what that means?? Coconut Creme Kisses! YUMMY.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-02 00:51:38	@Mia on top of the one I got last Thursday??? HOT	DAMN!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-02 01:17:08	@Mia from the juice I heard,  you might have one in LA soon. If not, I guess I can put it in my carry on.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-02 01:17:47	@Mia I draw the line though at bringing you some of their sweet tea. That is too much to trek to LA with.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-02 23:43:04	@Mia what happened to all our #Lobsters we were going to collect??
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-03 00:23:14	@Mia then we will have to get a #gaylobster from every country!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-02-01 21:07:20	Remind me not to be sick again. Too much work waiting for me.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-05 02:26:05	Looking for a bumper sticker that reads "My Pomeranian can kick your Honor Students Ass" Fingers crossed I can find it!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-05 22:10:48	enjoying watching this lady at Target make a complete ASS of herself over a cake!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-05 23:09:39	@Mia it was red velvet. Is it worth making an ass out of yourself in public? I am undecided.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-06 04:17:54	@AudraArenas OMG I love this Christmas card. I must get it for next year!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-06 04:33:09	@AudraArenas Thanks! Got my bumper sticker, and I think it might actually be better than what I was looking for
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-07 22:16:26	@AudraArenas I sure as hell did and as soon as I have it, I am slapping it on the car so fast heads will spin!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-08 01:21:31	Getting ready to watch the Oscars, eating home made potato soup, drinking sweet tea and painting my toe nails. My idea of a fun Sunday!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-08 01:30:44	Ok, can I change my Best Actor prediction to Jeff Bridges?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-08 01:44:52	Yeah, first award! Let's see if my guess was right?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-12 12:19:31	finished blow drying my hair, but so tired I don't want to get up to go flat iron it
54436265	itsrynie	2010-01-17 12:34:10	@Mia that would be a lot of fun to have everyone together, do it big this year!! Can't believe it has been 8 months since u left me.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-11 00:45:23	@Mia here is some matches bb.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-12 18:18:45	Did my time and broke free from work!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-21 00:45:12	So at the movies last night, the guy to the left of me orders a margherita pizza with no tomatoes. Why not order a cheese pizza with basil?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-23 03:41:48	if I could just find an extra $600, I could afford everything in my Old Navy shopping cart.  Money tree where are you???
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-14 06:11:37	What's up with all the random people texting me tonight? Half them I haven't heard from in forever.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-18 11:56:57	Thinks it's sad that when @Mia types ST:VOY, I automatically know what it means. This shit should not be in my vocab!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-31 19:51:01	to the guy at work hacking up a lung, GO HOME! I don't want your shit to infect me.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-31 23:55:52	Thanks Ricky for coming out, now  all your songs r stuck in my head. Must download some now and give the brain a break!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-01 03:32:06	Will the world as we know it cease to exist the day #JustinBieber is NOT a trending topic?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-01 13:22:07	First thing I thought when I saw a sign that said "Pushups for Charity"? BRAS for charity, WTF?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-29 03:08:25	@Mia why you need recipe for queso? You trying to get fancy with it?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-03-29 20:12:33	stuck at work in the worst pain of my life. This blows! Nobody decided to show up today.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-02 12:07:59	So I heard Clash of the Titans was an EPIC FAIL. Did anyone expect it to be as good as the original?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-06 02:16:02	Some how I have managed to jack up my neck. I have a disc out of alignment. Not very fun!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-06 14:48:33	my bank account is disappointing me!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-07 23:13:35	@Mia I vote bunch of pics/separate frames
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-07 23:28:40	I need my bank to stop telling me how much money I am spending. I don't want to know in the last 10 days I have spent $1453!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-07 23:30:30	On average that is $145.30 a day!  All I have to show for it is some paid bills
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-07 23:51:42	@Mia it's wrok! Cute boy from past in the area, so I spend my days stalking him in my head
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-07 23:58:09	@Mia....No. I haven't seen him in awhile. I think he quit, or knowing this place, was laid off.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-04 01:38:59	@Painz to you as well! Hopefully you get some great eggs!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-06 21:49:02	I snapped the underwire on my bra. Now it is poking me in the side.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-09 18:08:20	@BradWollack watch out @chunkhandler is on your tail! Looks like you might need that Zoloft sooner, rather than later!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-10 04:04:38	I just caught myself surfing the net, with my credit card hanging out of my mouth TWICE. I guess I was doing some major hunting!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-11 18:19:19	I think I am losing it. I have reached for the TV remote more than once, to turn down the volume on my iPod.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-12 06:11:34	@BonJovi killed it tonight in Dallas!! Can't wait until they come to town again. Worn out, going to bed. G'night .
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-12 17:51:33	Taking lunch back old school today. Chicken tenders with ketchup. I feel like I am 5 again.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-10 23:19:54	@Mia I am so proud of you! @BonJovi rocks on all occasions.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-11 02:42:37	@Mia how many bags of kisses do you want? I was only able to find the coconut and orange.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-11 02:57:22	Watching Iron Chef America, and have never seen a judge complain and be so negative about every dish, as Victoria Riccardi. Pull stick out!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-11 07:03:23	@Mia I did one better, and got your three of each
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-11 07:08:57	@Mia he just doesn't know. Once he tries them, he is going to wish I sent all 8 bags that I bought.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-13 20:09:07	Hospitals blow hard
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-16 03:28:56	OH at work today from one of the IT guys "Power to the FORCE!" Nerd much?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-19 03:48:36	I swear my sister is dressed like a 20 year old out on the town in her FB profile pic.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-19 21:41:01	People, learn to LIG'it (let it go)!! The longer you hold on to something, the more it eats away at you.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-21 00:51:59	@Mia I am sure that you could never let @dhlawrencexvii down
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-22 19:43:57	@Mia I heard #FOX is going to re air on Friday. However my guide does not reflect that.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-22 23:22:59	Some people. All you can do is shake your head at them and walk away.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-22 23:24:12	OH at work: Look at me. I am cutting you with my eyes.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-23 20:33:48	found @Mia the perfect little gift. Now she will just have to wait, to find out what it is
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-23 21:11:53	@Mia I haz it in a box with lots of kisses. Just need to mail it now!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-24 00:38:00	Watching #Chopped. Really guys, you had to use Rattlesnake in one of the baskets? GROSS
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-16 20:01:03	I think I justed typed my fingers off. However, I got a lot of work done.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-16 21:02:21	@AudraArenas good thing you did it. If it was up to @MissSaigon69 she would never register herself.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-16 21:03:18	@Mia mmmmmm Orange Chicken! I don't have that issue, as I just eat the leftovers cold.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-16 21:09:32	@Mia nothing can = THE PANDA
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-16 22:48:59	Really Lady? You took your poodle to the thrift store wit you? RIDIC!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-21 14:50:33	@Painz not much! Where have you been? Did you fall off the face of the earth? I hope everything is ok.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-22 19:42:16	@Mia I can do you one better. My DVR only recorded the first 35 mins and the last 3-5 mins
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-23 22:39:05	Prayz for me. I am heading into the mouth of HELL, otherwise known as #WALMART
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-28 03:49:37	At Sprouts earlier and they had Root Beer Twizzlers. I really wish I had bought some. I bet they taste NOMMY.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-28 23:32:13	@Painz mine has been ticking for the last 14 years. Since I was knee high to a grasshopper.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-01 01:19:50	After my Mom just  spent 2 weeks in and out of the ICU, it is just like my sister to ask my parents for $600.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-01 03:33:37	@Mia your kisses are in the mail!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-29 12:30:51	@Painz THANKS! Now "Let's Get It On" is now playing in my head. On repeat. HA
54436265	itsrynie	2010-04-30 15:55:59	I think my "girls" might be a little bit too much on display today.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-01 21:31:35	I am stuffed full of chips, salsa, tacos, enchiladas, and Margaritas, and much more!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-03 02:12:55	I can't stand liars. If you are going to lie to me, or about me, then we no longer need to be friends. Not that we were ever friends.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-03 02:39:38	Going to hunt through my Parents photo albums, when I go out there for my Mom's birthday in two weeks. Can't wait to see the gems I find.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-06 21:38:16	OH at work: You can wish me a Happy Mom's Day, I am a Daddy Momma!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-01 15:41:57	@Painz she is doing good now. Been back at home for a week now. Think this episode scared her into caring about her health.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-01 15:43:09	Getting ready to meet a friend for lunch. I plan on having some yummy Mexican food and a giant Margarita!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-05 20:03:42	@Mia did they get all melty, or are they still ok?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-20 23:48:52	Since when did having to have a chest xray for breathing issues, turn in to having to have a CatScan?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-05 21:25:39	@Mia I know I sent them to you, but now I am jelis that I don't have any!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-07 15:07:27	Off to the chiropractor. Then off to get me some big bucks, fingers crossed.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-08 02:43:16	Just cried like a baby after watching #Chopped, because the chef that won, was beyond deserving.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-09 16:46:52	Watching Hot Fuzz. I don't know which is more epic, Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-09 18:58:20	@LoniLove the special was hilarious! I especially loved the opening. Also, your outfit was killer.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-09 19:50:44	It is so cute how my Dad calls me evry Mother's Day, to remind me to call my Mom!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-09 19:58:43	@helloross if you hear someone hollering at you in July, don't be scared it's just me. If I see you, I plan on making myself known.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-22 02:45:52	I made spaghetti squash with bacon and parmesan, sauteed baby bella mushrooms and a heirloom tomato salad for dinner. It turned out yummy!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-01 02:56:18	Never had a Bloody Mary, but after making my own homemade tomato juice today, I am now craving one. Think I will make some this weekend!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-07 23:41:25	@Painz no sippin gin and juice. I am being a good girl now. This Sat is different story!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-08 02:28:27	@Painz I have several shades of grey! However I am having a girls night on Sat so I am saving up.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-08 03:00:26	I love that someone made a Twitter for Lindsay's scram braclet @FreckleLeech
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-07 19:26:48	@Mia it's just a haunted night tour of The Queen Mary and a cemetery tour. That is not a haunted house
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-09 20:13:58	Happy Birthday #DietCoke. I both love and miss you. Come see me sometime.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-12 03:42:09	#CupcakeWars judge Candace get a new word. I could make a drinking game with your use of "underwhelmed". Here is a thesaurus..
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-12 04:13:06	Editing some work before submission, watching Friday the 13th and cuddling with the puppies, all from the comfort of my bed.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-12 04:14:12	@Painz I stopped counting after the 3rd time in 2 minutes. Please you do not play a drinking game with beer. Game is for hardcore shots only
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-12 04:14:50	@Mia IZ NOT SASSY FRASSY
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-13 19:52:02	I haz a package at home and I don't know what it is. It is killing me, I am like a kid at Christmas. Must wait until 7
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-13 23:23:03	OMG! There is a mash up of Mel Gibson and Christian Bale's bitch fits. I must listen.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-09 21:09:49	Eating green tea ice cream with tempura bananas. YUMMY!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-09 21:38:39	Off to Highland Village and #JamesAvery
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-10 05:49:52	@Painz GOOD! While they are both hilarious, I am a Shaun of the Dead girl all the way. Don't know I prefer it, but I do.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-10 14:54:49	@Painz I love Clerks! Although I love most of Kevin Smith's movies.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-11 00:09:51	OH at work: I'm like Kenny Rogers. I know when to hold em and I know when to fold em.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-11 00:15:46	Fucking Tornados! You're making the news interrupt DWTS.  You're in OK right now, I'm not worried.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-11 21:35:46	How is ABC going to pull #Happytown? They have only aired 2 eps, and I was starting to get in to it.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-11 22:08:14	My back and shoulder are killing me. As much as I hate getting up early to go to the chiropractor, I am ready for my appt tom
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-12 19:50:08	@Mia Texas says come back and visit some time.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-02 15:02:08	So in about an hour, I will have my Fridays back! I feel like they have been held hostage for the last 3 months Welcome back BB!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-02 15:05:52	Yesterday this guy at work says he has something to tell me, and I am either going to find it interesting or weird. Can I get a 3rd choice??
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-02 19:49:10	Watching NCIS and baking Snickerdoodles for my Dad's birthday.  Well deserved Friday if I do say so myself!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-02 19:50:52	Feel very accomplished today. By 12:30 I had found 3 products I have been searching months for.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-03 01:15:27	Stupid American Airlines commercial with the soldier, is making me cry. I must stop watching TV.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-03 20:20:14	Watching Behind Enemy Lines. One of Owen Wilson's best, I think.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-05 14:56:50	@Mia can you send me the flight details when you have them?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-07 17:25:55	@Mia I have me a good list. You are going to have to suck it up for some
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-07 19:53:54	@Mia wut?? It will be fun. I have to do all this shit while I am a tourist. I can't do it as a resident, cause then I would be so uncool.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-08 01:33:38	@Painz What you got to tell me?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-08 22:16:56	Such a girl. I got caught in a rainstorm. The fact that my clothes and shoes are soaked doesn't bother me. I am upset that my hair is wet!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-09 19:43:31	So much for sleeping late on my first chiropractic free Friday in 3 months. I have been up since 9:45 am.  Maybe I've lost my mojo.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-08 23:42:41	@Painz I should have said a girls night in!!!  Although who knows what we will get up to.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-09 03:08:31	@Mia Way to be on time to class.  Nice of you to join the rest of the world Ms. von Doom. Thanks for gracing us with your presence.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-09 03:20:12	@Mia I first had The Laughing Cow spreadable cheese in JUNIOR HIGH. They are good with a bagel and sausage for breakfast.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-09 03:42:32	@Mia You should have taken French class like I did, then you could have had you some Laughing Cow for free
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-09 04:07:49	Heard on #CHOPPED, "I'm going to win this contest, because I'm a sexy beast". Umm ok. I thought this was a food contest
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-09 04:09:11	I see another Dr's appt in my future. I have a knot on my knee. Currently icing it and hoping it goes down, tomorrow is another day.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-09 04:30:41	What "the sexy beast" won??? #CHOPPED
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-09 20:18:58	Someone at work took two Valtrex with out knowing what they were for. Funniest story ever!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-10 12:46:39	Poor Lewisville kids!! Are you ever going to get out of school for the summer??
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-11 04:02:46	Greatest answer on # Cash Cab. Crow's Nest. I was into Pirates, it's a Crow's Nest.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-11 04:31:04	@Mia I just had the most deliciously brilliant idea. Kings Hawaiian bread pudding!! I must investigate now.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-11 15:52:36	Done with the chiropractor. On my way to the Humane Society to donate Waffles food and litter.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-11 15:53:57	Success!! Found a recipe for Kings Hawaiian bread pudding. This one has white choc and pecans and topped with a caramel sauce.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-12 01:11:53	@Kings_Hawaiian Thanks!  I shall see how it turns out tomorrow. Currently letting the bread get stale, so I can make it more yummy!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-12 19:55:32	So my @Kings_Hawaiian bread pudding turned out awesome! I am taking it to a party tonight, and hope everyone enjoys it.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-15 22:06:10	8 years today with work. Can't believe it has been so long!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-15 23:25:36	Wonder exactly how much sleep I will get in the next 2 days?? I have a shit ton of stuff that needs to get done.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-16 03:15:36	@MissSaigon69 Thanks Loni!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-16 03:16:41	@Mia NO HEATZ!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-16 18:50:55	Letting the computer defeat me. I guess I am not allowed to check in online for my flight. Tired of fucking with it and it is frustrating me
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-17 17:30:42	I've seen so many service men and women at the airport today. It is very humbling.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-18 17:59:35	@NathanFillion DRATW from a Texas girl who is in California for the next 10 days!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-21 22:37:49	First day relaxing in CA. Me and a bunch of suicidal monkees are vegging in front of the TV.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-25 09:04:30	Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes? Any guesses as to what I'm watching??
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-25 20:42:14	@AudraArenas you would be correct. While you were wishing your hubby a happy bday, I was watching mine in action!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-26 21:25:59	At the airport waiting on my plane. I really wish people could control their children, before I do it for them!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-29 22:29:38	I don't know which is creepier, the Quizno's commercial with the cats, or the Kia commercial with the hip hop hamsters.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-30 02:36:33	@MissSaigon69 I also DVR'd Covert Affairs, just haven't watched the eps yet. It looks like a good one too
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-11 19:04:01	Why is ST:TNG playing on my TV? And why do I feel the need to laugh, every time someone says "alien probe"?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-12 00:19:02	@Mia Man up, rub some dirt in it.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-12 14:55:04	Suitcase is mostly packed. Just need to clean the house, do laundry and run errands. Have 5 more days to accomplish everything.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-13 01:26:37	@Mia Is it bad that just by seeing the price tag, I know you are at Target?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-14 15:05:43	So much stuff to get done, and not enough time to get it done!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-16 03:16:18	@MissSaigon69 I plan on it. Can't wait to see you back at work, when I get back!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-16 03:35:44	@Mia Ummm I haven't quite made it out there, so I don't think I could have "brought it"! However, I can pack up some Texas Heat, if you want
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-16 18:51:13	PEACE OUT. Going to go get some other shit done.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-17 04:05:54	Packing up the laptop, it is a distraction, got too much to get done and it is already 11 pm. Will be headed to CA in less than 15 hours.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-17 16:52:18	At the aeroportz, waiting and waiting.......should I take a nap?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-23 19:24:08	Mad insomnia and killer cramps has made for the worst past 2 days ever!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-23 23:16:02	Excuse me, California.....who do I have to shiv to find a box of Golden Grahams in this state? Please point them out.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-14 22:27:24	@Mia DOOD. I am totally going to meet Pauly Shore on Thursday and get a pic. Now I just need a copy of Son In Law he can autograph
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-14 23:20:38	@Mia I will see what I can do
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-16 02:08:05	@Mia WTH?? Please tell me this pic is at a book store and not in your house.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-30 02:47:01	@MissSaigon69 trust me, stay away from the cats commercial, it is just as bad as the Kia one
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-30 02:51:29	The Pandas doesn't like me today. So laying in bed watching the Resident Evil trilogy and chewing Tums.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-30 23:05:24	@Mia that is just a wee bit creepy. At least mine doesn't a one of the girls. Although if it matched Mavs, I would be a beautiful blonde!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-30 23:08:02	Singing along to #BonJovi and flat ironing my hair. Be jelis your life isn't this complex/complicated!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-31 00:27:38	The Chinese delivery guy just told me my apartment "smells good in there" and wanted to know if I "lit a candle". LOL
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-31 00:55:14	@Mia didn't go down like that. He was more like a Chinese boy from the valley, who was slightly emo.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-31 02:29:20	@chunkhandler considering one of them is dead that would be really hard. Maybe you could fill in for him?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-31 03:05:59	My fortune says "Now is a good time for you to explore. Take a vacation."  #FortuneCookieFAIL.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-31 03:47:56	@Painz 2, 9, 30, 26, 18 and 45. You win, and I need a cut!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-31 03:48:47	@Mia that is why it is a massive FAIL! At least it was true, it was just a little too late. So I do still have some faith in fortune cookies
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-31 04:23:15	@Painz spit in hand, shake, DEAL. Legal and binding.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-01 00:01:56	Quitting my job, packing up the car, and moving out of this heat! Hopefully I can find a house and job in whatever cool place I wind up in.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-01 00:20:43	Fuck #GLEE doing a Britney episode. We can we have an all #BonJovi ep???
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-01 00:26:43	@Mia BJ is relevant, not Shitney Spears. Bitch is only relevant cause she is bat shit crazy. Yes, I went there.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-01 01:23:19	@Mia you love to give your $$$ to Chick -fil-A. Same thing.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-01 01:26:39	@Mia hmmm now I think I will run JUST ACROSS THE STREET and get me some, before they close up for their peace, love, workshopz day.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-01 01:38:26	@Mia and it only took like 15 years for US to actually figure out what that meant
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-24 07:09:22	When some body asks a stupid question, how do you keep from replying with out coming off like a total BITCH?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-24 08:33:59	@LorenLA  that is better than what I do, I just open my mouth and respond, and usually sound like an evil troll
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-25 09:02:03	@AudraArenas OMG, you just had to go there!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-27 05:05:47	@Mia I don't have the words to describe how amazingly wonderfully awesome it was to come home and take a LONG HOT shower!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-27 05:07:36	Apparently when I was gone Charlie some how unearthed a cow hoof, and she is beyond blissfully happy. Me not so much, ever smelled one?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-27 05:08:52	However, after being gone so long and her reaction when I came back, I don't have the heart to take it away. She could get away with murder.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-27 05:09:55	@Mia I totally forget until I saw the billboard on my way home, but we have a Culvers here. Tell D I said thanks
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-27 06:10:47	@Mia INOZ, but it was still AMAZING!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-28 01:11:42	My Dad is so cute, called to ask my advise. In his words my Mom wants a "skateboarding dog"!! I told him to get her the Bulldog.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-28 04:14:24	Popping some melatonin. Hoping to get my sleep pattern back on CST.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-29 00:48:24	I can not get the lyrics to Dr Feelgood out of my head. It does not help to listen to the song, it just makes it worse!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-29 01:56:19	@Painz it was spectacular spectacular!! I didn't want to leave, except I had babies waitin' for me at home, so I had to come back
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-29 02:09:25	@Painz he' the one that makes you feel all right...........he's gonna be your Frankenstein. Got to love the Crue.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-29 02:11:38	Catching up on DVR, watching Rizzoli & Isles. Feel like a 10 yr old girl as Donnie Wahlberg is on here. I used to LOVE Donnie!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-29 02:12:34	@Mia you've never needed a license to do that!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-29 02:54:52	After 3 eps of Rizzoli & Isles, I am digging it. But can I ask what is up with the theme music? It sounds like shit you would riverdance to.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-29 03:46:51	@Mia watcha gonna do BEOTCH??
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-29 04:33:57	@Mia Bring IT!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-17 19:39:42	leaving work early, so I can be a slacker and go meet @PaulyMShore
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-17 22:22:31	OH @ Pauly Shore meet and greet I wouldn't walk across the street to see Pauly Shore for free....I mean Garth Brooks.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-21 21:43:01	How is the mail guy at work only going to pick up 2 out of the 3 envelopes I put in the outbox? And he missed the biggest one. JACKASS.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-21 23:38:31	Trying to decide if I want to make a sammich when I get home, or pick up Japanese on the way home. #Choices.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-21 23:40:32	@Painz you hiding under a rock??
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-08 15:57:39	One time lift of the embargo on "stay home Sundays", since I am off work tomorrow. Meeting a friend for lunch and Salt.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-08 23:50:29	My nemesis Armageddon is on the TV again! DAMN, I tried to avoid it yesterday and it didn't work. Walking away....
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-09 00:21:32	@Mia you might as well give up on that dream. WILL NEVER HAPPEN!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-09 00:27:43	Who told me to try the Kung Pao Chicken??? Who ever it was is fired. We are done.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-10 21:46:16	Am I supposed to be disturbed by the Jet Blue guy? I think he is awesome, and wish I could leave work like that everyday.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-10 22:24:32	@Mia Snake Plissken is the shit!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-10 22:27:52	@LorenLA if a customer had done that to me, I would have reacted the same way!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-11 12:48:41	I guess my dogs thought their lips were chapped, so they decided to eat one of my lip balms. Hope it works out for them.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-11 15:46:34	Don't know what the deal is w/me and #MotleyCrue. First it was Dr Feelgood, now I have Home Sweet Home stuck in my head.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-11 15:47:21	Next it will be Girls Girls Girls that I can't get out of my head.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-12 02:26:54	Watching the Bloody Mary ep of #Supernatural, and I now have the urge to go in the bathroom and summon her. Should I?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-12 03:19:35	@joshwolfcomedy I am tired of waiting......when will you be back?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-12 22:37:43	@Mia "a box to hold my bags" IDK why I find that so funny. It's like I'm a 12 yr old boy today.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-12 22:56:38	@Mia don't flatter yourself BB.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-13 02:33:26	It is 930 and I can barely keep my eyes open. Think I am going to have to stop fighting it and give in.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-13 02:52:11	@Mia answer the question HOAR, for some reason I want to know what your response is.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-13 02:56:32	@LorenLA @Mia Viv is already an alien, so this could work.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-13 03:15:54	@Mia I liked the pink with sparkles. For Girls!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-13 03:18:35	Watching T2 but swear I keep hearing Riverdance music. The Terminator wasn't Michael Flatley was he???
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-13 12:57:45	It's 8 am and it is 90 degrees. #Criminal
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-13 18:05:23	To the two ladies in the handicap stall in the 3rd floor green bathroom at work......this is not the time nor the place!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-13 18:12:56	@Jokoy Dallas is worse. Aren't you coming here soon?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-14 00:51:48	How come the same shirt looks cute and casual on another. On me, looks like I could be arrested for indecent exposure.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-14 00:58:29	Can one survive on spring rolls alone?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-14 03:27:12	Wondering if 10:30 at night is too late to be moving my sofa around my apartment?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-14 03:49:21	@Jokoy watching Chelsea now, thank god the outfit is now explained. I was praying you didn't run around town dressed like that normally
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-14 16:17:58	Currently sitting in the car waiting for thr rain to lighten up a bit. Yes I have an umbrella, but I still don't want to get out in this shi
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-14 17:50:09	I think I found the perfect imitation of Chanel's Jade polish. It only took a few months.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-14 17:50:54	Why does the Tsunami wait to hit, until 10 minutes before they are supposed to deliver my new sofa? Sonofabitch!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-14 18:55:56	Fucking rain. Delaying my sofa delivery, making me cancel my hair appt. Normally I would enjoy u!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-14 20:57:17	Remind me to never give my number to a guy I just met. BIG HUGE mistake!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-15 15:39:24	Be careful what you wish/ask for. It just might come true.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-02 18:14:44	I got real used to not working these last two weeks. Anyone need a housewife? I'm for hire.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-02 23:38:52	Trying to decide if I want to stop by the store after work, and buy the ingredients to make bubble pizza.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-03 21:03:39	@MissSaigon69 I did. After I saw her status I looked it up online to see if I could find a recipe. I found one and am going to try it today.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-03 22:20:06	Listening to Dynamite by Taio Cruz and dancing in the kitchen while cooking pizza and watching #Supernatural in the background. #Multitasker
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-03 22:20:41	@Mia I am pretty sure that I don't even want to know!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-04 01:05:13	Anybody else scared when opening a can of biscuits, or is it just me? I keep waiting for it to kick back and take out one of my eyes.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-04 01:07:28	I always stand way back, close my eyes and use a dish towel to pull the tab off. It is worse if it doesn't pop and I have to use a spoon.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-04 03:16:22	Why is Alton Brown making hooch on #GoodEats? He's calling it "Punch", but where I come from, we call it Hooch.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-17 22:04:16	Ok if I knew an xray would take this long, I would've come tomorrow instead. DAMN
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-19 04:12:23	@Mia BITCH you better recognize! You will never be as cool as me.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-19 05:22:58	Work tomorrow is not looking good. I have been laying in bed for 2 hrs now. I can't breath and can't stop coughing.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-14 15:32:04	It should be against the law to be awake before noon on the weekend.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-14 19:07:41	Just had an amazing lunch with a friend at #Maggiano's. First time eating there, and I will so be going back!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-14 22:53:18	Laying on the sofa in the den, all I can hear from the TV in the living room is a shoot out. It has been going on for 5 mins now.....
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-14 22:54:06	......this must be one HELL of a movie I'm missing!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-14 23:11:20	Ah, I am missing a good movie, Heat.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-14 23:52:16	Was invited to go out to a bar with some people. Don't really know them, so not sure if I want to go. May put on my pj's and call it a day.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-15 17:28:12	@LoniLove didn't realize we went to the same church. Rev. Pillowtop gave an amazing sermon this morning. I could listen to it all day.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-16 18:07:59	@Mia HELL must be frozen over. It is way too DAMN early for you to be up.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-16 18:45:26	@Mia FUCK that SHIT!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-16 23:42:18	Love the webz. Don't leave work for 30 mins, but already placed my Chipotle order to pick up on the way home!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-20 17:21:35	Just starting to blow dry my hair, and my Mom comes in here and starts yaking on the phone. Can I go home already?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-20 17:22:18	Trying to wait the call out, but it has been like 20 minutes already......
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-23 21:10:05	@Painz what kind of phone did you get?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-23 23:12:45	@Painz I knew you were going to say an iPhone. You're not supposed to drink the kool-aid!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-24 20:12:48	OMG there is a dude at work wearing a kilt!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-24 21:34:45	I think work might be slow when you start playing #6degreesofKevinBacon with your co-workers
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-25 20:06:37	Dear DVR, please record more episodes of #NCIS! I have already finished watching the ones from earlier this week, kthanxbai.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-25 20:58:27	@Mia can I come to California??
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-26 17:48:05	Don't know that I trust a #CajunChef that calls bell peppers, onions and celery the "triology". Ummm it is a trinity!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-04 21:11:35	OH @ work: Why don't you go to the cafe downstairs? God no, I would rather chew on a empty Gatorade bottle!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-04 21:27:49	@MissSaigon69 me too! I have been playing it on continuous repeat on my iPod. Great dance song!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-04 22:27:53	Listening to someone at work make an ok situation complicated, and drag managers into it. PLEASE SHOOT ME!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-04 23:27:55	Breathe people!!  If you don't understand @jumblejim 's tweet question him, but don't call him an f'ing idiot.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-04 23:30:24	I don't get people who say they are standing up for something/defending someone, but they use HATE to do it.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-05 12:35:12	Stupid clock. Thought I was waking up 20 mins late, but actually woke up 10 mins early. I wanted to sleep those extra 30 mins!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-05 12:39:54	Want it known I am working half a day this Fri and all day next Fri. Hell is starting to freeze over, and the end of the world is near.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-05 18:08:45	Didn't know my Dad was on Twitter RT@jumblejim...if they hurt as much as the temp crowns...I'll pull 'em out with pliers.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-06 22:46:22	@PauleyP many prayers for Little Joe and CeCe from me and my 3 pups
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-06 22:54:01	@Mia it tastes fine to me
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-07 18:00:52	Catching up on my DVR, and who do I spot while watching an ep of NCIS.... @Jon_Huertas , he just keeps popping up all over my TV these days.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-07 21:13:04	Armageddon is playing on my TV now. I absolutely refuse to watch it, but I refuse to change the channel.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-08 02:51:34	It maybe time to change the ringtone for my texts. Every time it goes off it startles the hell out of me.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-22 18:05:22	Why does my Dad think if a bell pepper is any other color than green, that I'll like it?? I don't like bell peppers encompasses all colors!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-25 12:42:17	Feeling yucky today. Just took some meds, hope that will settle my stomach. Taking my time going to work.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-25 18:11:27	HOLY SHIT, it is 75 outside. Nice!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-18 21:44:38	How come I order my jeans from Old Navy in short/petite and I still have to roll them?? I'm not that short.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-18 22:33:55	@Mia sorry bb! Hope it gets better.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-18 23:57:10	Just saw pics from my HS reunion that was 2 years ago. I didn't miss anything.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-20 02:27:57	I hate that I'm exiled from my own house for 2 days. This sucks!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-20 04:28:41	Don't like being in BFE in a room with a bay window that has no curtains or blinds. I'm pretty sure Jason is out there waiting....
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-22 01:31:20	Can't wait for a good night of sleep. We are back home, and the dog's are on their turf. I will not have to wake up to barking!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-22 04:50:42	@Mia did you get the Kobe burger again?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-22 04:52:15	Almost done putting everything back in its place, so I can get my house back in order.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-22 05:18:50	@Mia I'd be more jelis if you had some octopus in there.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-23 01:10:02	107 outside today, WTF? I'm calling my lawyer, I think a divorce from Texas is in the immediate future.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-27 17:36:28	@Painz not to be cruel and unsympathetic, but that is what you get for drinking the kool-aid. Seriously though, hope the new one works out!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-27 21:20:46	@Painz nah, I'm being very boring and watching an #NCIS marathon, cleaning house and washing clothes.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-27 21:25:28	@Painz kilts at work = so not attractive.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-27 22:07:55	@Painz you need to be able to check that one off your bucket list
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-29 19:52:45	1st time ordering from #EOS and I am beyond empressed with their service. I haven't even received my order yet,that says a lot!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-29 20:11:57	@Painz leaving in 2 weeks!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-24 00:55:12	Why do I buy Vanilla Zingers, peel the frosting off and eat the cake? Isn't that basically a Twinkie?? #RynieQuirks
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-27 21:29:07	It is really sad if you're 30 and live with your Parents and don't have a car. Where is your life going??
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-29 17:27:31	Best line on TV today...."My Dad is sick.....Mom says he got a dirty whore."  Delivered by a 5 year old!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-29 23:04:20	In the kitchen making Cabbage Jumbalaya that I got from @loni_te, and Kale "chips", while watching L&O SVU and listening to tunes.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-30 01:15:42	@Mia when are you going to come see us? Your god children miss you.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-30 01:27:50	How do you lose a DVD when you live by yourself?? I can't find "Love Actually" and I want to watch it. I don't recall loaning it to anyone.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-04 15:59:55	@Mia one childhood fantasy come true, check.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-05 00:12:53	Hanging out in Shreveport today. Already went on a Red River cruise.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-05 06:07:51	@Painz it was just a day raodtrip, and since I'm the driver, I was a good girl.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-05 17:42:05	I've got some major onion breath, anybody got a mint or stick of gum?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-05 18:38:27	Trying to make a list of everything to pack for my trip, and I can't remember shit that I have in my closet!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-06 02:55:28	I need a bigger place! Just had to go excavating in the storage closet to get out my suitcase. Unable to locate small suitcase, only large.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-06 02:56:39	Found 5 prescription bottles with meds in them in the bathroom drawer. Had to Google most of them, as I had no clue what they were for.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-07 19:07:58	@Mia cause you're not going to like them. Think along the lines of that scary attraction we went through at Universal
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-08 15:42:51	@Painz I will be out there from the 17th to the 26th
54436265	itsrynie	2010-07-08 22:19:09	To my credit, if I was going home the wet hair wouldn't bother me. But I am still at work!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-22 21:01:54	Just watched the cutest video of a 2 year old Ella singing @justinbieber Baby. Too precious!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-22 21:08:00	Even though I just ordered a shit ton of clothes from Old Navy a few weeks ago. I just ordered 7 more shirts and a pair of capris.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-22 21:08:40	I guess I will have a complete new wardrobe when I hit CA in two months.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-23 01:35:57	Watching a #Chopped marathon. Why does the only girl have to cry when she gets kicked off? Man up BITCH! Although, I am sure I would cry too
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-23 02:51:52	@ChrisEe88 had she got all the peaches on the dish, she might have made it to the next round.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-23 05:49:24	Watching #DragMeToHell. This Gypsy Bitch is really scary. Freaking me out. Horror movies don't bother me, but apparently Gypsy Bitches do.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-24 20:37:33	As the day progresses, I seem to accumulate more plans for this long 4 day Memorial Weekend.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-24 20:38:51	As of this past Sat, I had an appt with my Chiropractor on Friday and a day trip to Fredricksberg on Sat.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-24 20:39:47	As of this past Sun, I had a birthday for this Sun added to the mix. Which means shopping for a gift on Fri
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-24 20:41:05	As of today I now have a friend spending the night on Friday and we are meeting friends for dinner, drinks and the new SATC movie
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-24 21:13:20	Also have another Dr's appt on Friday. I am going to need Memorial Day to rest up!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-24 23:37:24	I think I was born without a control gene. I ordered another 2 tops and a canvas bag from ON and a cardigan from Target!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-25 03:08:58	I can't believe I forgot how amazingly fun #CashCab is!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-25 03:50:32	Really #ABCFamily that was the series finally to #10ThingsIHateAboutYou???
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-26 03:26:41	@Mia I think your god child may be moving on to the other side.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-26 04:37:25	@Mia as of about 5 minutes ago, she has passed on. Getting her out from under the bed now.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-26 04:59:07	@Mia are you calling right number? 9841 is the BOND line.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-26 16:27:15	@Painz living this crazy life!  Looking forward to the long 4 day weekend, even though I won't have a moment to breathe.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-26 23:04:42	@Mia HAHAHAHAHA!!!! We took that test when we were 15/16. I barely passed it the first time, I doubt I could do it again.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-26 23:06:31	@Mia JULZ better watch out. D will grill her, like he did that steak!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-28 06:12:53	“@ohioevilone: this isn't Blake at all”....... Trust me it is @blakeshelton. He has mentioned his Twitter and drunk ass tweets in interviews
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-28 06:25:36	@Mia I will try and be shocked by this news....... eh it's not working.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-29 05:49:46	Enjoyed a good dinner and drinks with friends tonight. Then saw SATC2.  I thought it was great, and funnier than I anticipated.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-30 23:49:41	I love how we are having a sun shower right now. Can't remember having one in years.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-31 02:57:37	Just realized I only have to work 2 1/2 days this week. SCORE!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-05-31 03:01:07	Watching ICA Flay vs Stone. If I ever meet #CurtisStone, I want him to make me grilled tomato sorbet!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-01 21:45:25	Almost finished with today! Just a day and a half, to go.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-01 23:19:19	Why do some people want me to be tacky with them?? There are 4 of us left tonight in our tiny dept.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-01 23:21:14	cont'd and some moron wants to ask if so&so is still here. Do you see her motherfuckin' ass? Then NO she is not still here!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-01 23:22:42	Stupid ass people
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-02 01:30:47	Almost pissed my pants when I came home. Parked next to storm drain, looked over eyes looking back at me. Thought Pennywise was gonna get me
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-02 01:31:56	Turned out to be a damn cat. Jebus, just cause I lost a cat, doesn't mean I want another one. Please stop throwing cats at me!!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-02 17:02:01	@Mia I has a big dilemma. Will call you later to get your input!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-02 17:11:46	@Painz did a little drinking on Friday. Road trip and getting sun burnt on Saturday. How was your weekend?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-03 18:45:13	@Mia I made a compromise!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-03 19:42:53	At the Dentist getting my teefers cleaned. Damn their bathroom is bigger than mine!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-03 21:00:13	@Mia I took it back, but exchanged for a SS Amethyst Rememberence ring. Still got $198 back.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-03 21:01:26	@Mia also they are stackable so later I could go get a Dec one, and be all BFF cutesy!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-06-03 21:29:00	@Mia what??? I had to get something, so I wouldn't be so SAD!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-26 23:05:04	@Mia can you have brunch in the afternoon???
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-27 18:18:16	@MissSaigon69 awwww you're soooo sweet!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-29 03:09:29	@loni_te It look good, better than the one I have of you!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-30 00:41:48	@loni_te it turned out awesome, now my Dad wants the recipe! Thanks for sharing!! I don't really care for the Emmys. Oscars are my game.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-30 20:05:25	Heard "Great Balls of Fire" and thought of my @Mia, interesting.....but I know why it made me think of her
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-30 21:45:28	@Mia HELL YES!! I was thinking back to first time I watched it at ur house. So many of my first movies were viewed there.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-30 23:54:54	@Mia so you're the reason why my life is the way it is? #MiaCorruption
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-31 01:47:52	@Mia $20 that would be more like $20K
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-08 23:43:31	In the storm shelter at work due to the TORNADO, otherwise known as the 3rd floor conference room.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-08 23:54:47	@Mia that's right beeotch. I've been here for 10 hrs and ain't staying a minute past 7.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-11 01:23:12	My family is beyond fucked up. Am I the only normal one?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-31 18:12:51	OH at work: Are your boobies hard??? LOL wut??
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-31 18:16:05	OH at work: When you get in my car this afternoon, can you tell me if it smells like vomit?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-08-31 19:23:07	OH at work: I have to crush my water bottles, otherwise a dolphin might swallow it and choke on it.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-01 03:32:41	Work today was interesting.....vajay jays, boobies, peacocks, dolphins, vomit and a sonogram pic.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-02 23:34:41	I have Katy Perry's Peacock stuck in my head. Can't imagine why??
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-12 06:17:02	It's 1 in the morning and I'm making jambalaya and watching Hellraiser III. So random.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-18 04:34:38	@Mia hope this makes you feel better about your life. Cameron just got out of the pokey after a long stay, apparently.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-19 04:22:58	Oh, they also taught me how to correctly poor beer into your icy cold stein. I feel like I can now go forth and conquer the world.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-03 21:19:07	@Mia no Chicken Caesar salad is worth that.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-08 13:43:11	I love me some rain, but this is too much. Just spent the last 40 mins swimming to work. Wish I was back at home under the covers!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-11 01:22:36	@Chris_Gorham Kale chips are the best. Super addictive and a great alternative to potato chips
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-12 04:20:23	Is it sad that I didn't have a single canned item in my pantry to donate to the canned food drive? Instead I had to go buy 'em at the store
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-13 03:00:10	Sorry, I didn't realize Linkin Park was still relevant,
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-13 03:02:52	Starting to think I shouldn't have taken that Melatonin with those two Benadryl. Oh well, at least I should sleep good tonight!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-21 01:21:53	@Mia I'm slightly curious, but not curious enough to Google it. Would give me nightmares for months, I'm sure!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-21 01:22:30	Can DWTS hurry up and be over, so I can watch #Castle???
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-21 23:44:34	Thanks to being sick and DVR, I have now watched the season 3 premiere of #Castle four times. Gets better each time!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-13 03:14:23	I would've been more impressed if Kanye and Taylor had done a duet together, instead of singing their own songs about the "incident".
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-14 02:21:25	One week until #Castle premier. @seamusdever @Jon_Huertas @NathanFillion can't wait to see the BOYS back in action!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-14 02:21:54	@Mia Why you so mean to your fans? Stupid bish!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-14 03:11:52	Of course #Rizzoli&Isles is going to end like that! Now I have to wait until the next season, to find out what happens.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-14 19:54:12	Great idea for pumkin carving contest #JerseyShore!! Can imagine a pumkin @snooki @jenniwoww and @djpaulyd ???
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-09 17:40:51	On a friend's recommendation I watched "Get him to the Greek" as it was supposed to be hilarious. I think I laughed twice during the movie.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-12 04:20:06	Feel slightly depressed today, don't know why I let someone else's hate bring me down. I guess because I witnessed it first hand.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-16 23:40:52	Hitting up the Oktoberfest tomorrow. Going the get me a stein and drink tons of beer!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-17 00:24:35	Did I mention I don't like beer?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-18 17:08:19	@Mia that I've been unable to figure out. Just got out yesterday, and from what I can guess been gone since b4 Xmas.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-18 20:35:57	Think is took a bigger bite out of something, than I could chew. It will drive me bananas until I finish. Once finished I will celebrate!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-19 04:12:04	I'm tired. Taking a break from work, and relaxing for an hour or so. Then I will finish up my "assignment".
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-19 04:22:15	Realized I learned one thing from my Parents. Always wash your beer stein by hand, never dry, and place straight into the freezer.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-19 08:59:10	I can safely say I will not be watching another ep TPIR for a long ass time
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-21 21:58:03	I know I'm sick but srsly, why can't I get warm? I'm wearing jeans, t-shirt, a zip up hoodie, plus I'm wrapped up in a quilt. Still cold!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-21 23:51:25	@Kings_Hawaiian Pearl Jam
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-22 02:06:22	@loni_te sure I did, but #Castle was awesome, so it wasn't bad.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-25 03:12:09	Waiting to see #TheTown #BenAffleck BITCHES.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-25 06:07:34	@loni_te the movie was awesome. I loved it. Highly recommend!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-27 03:01:33	Wow it was in the 70's all day today, and currently it is 66. Got to love Texas weather, changes at the drop of a hat.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-27 14:49:05	@Mia DUDE! They opened a drive thru Subway, down the street from the house.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-27 22:28:25	@Mia hah! It is actually on your old street, but closer to me!! I think I should give it a whirl.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-27 23:38:49	@Mia I'm very slit my wrists about this. Moonshadows is OURS, stop going with other peeps!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-28 03:29:49	#Castle is it me or is Beckett wearing a lot of flowy tops and jackets?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-28 03:57:52	@jumblejim their loss. I would have killed to see you on NCIS.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-28 04:00:12	@Mia this still does not atone for your sins, however I forgive you.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-28 04:04:41	@Jon_Huertas what is the pin that Esposito wears on his lapel?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-28 04:43:14	To the person who's car alarm has gone off for the 20th time tonight..... turn the damn thing off! Thanks
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-28 04:52:27	Don't find it strange that sometimes in order to fall asleep, the TV has to be on for background noise.......
54436265	itsrynie	2010-09-28 04:53:51	....... do find it strange that when the TV is on for background noise, it must be a horror movie. I find them soothing for sleep, wtf??
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-22 00:04:16	Yoga Joe was getting a BJ at work!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-03 17:59:05	Why is Extreme Home Makeover on my TV? I can't change the channel and this show makes me cry like a big bb.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-03 20:35:19	Giving up on this horror movie on SyFy "The Seamstress". BORING. Going to go through my DVD's and find a good horror movie to watch.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-04 02:47:48	Watched the first ep of #TheEvent tonight. Who is not on this show? I know I just saw The Candyman aka Tony Todd.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-23 03:23:14	I think my FB stream just blew up.....wait a minute, that's just the Rangers winning and make it to the FIRST World Series!!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-04 18:20:27	I'm always workin' slavein' every day
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-05 00:45:59	Love how I just said to my dog "Control, you can haz it?"
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-05 20:14:20	@Mia that's CREEPEE!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-07 23:19:49	Got cheated out of 2 hours of OT at work. I could've shived a bitch.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-09 16:31:04	@Mia Shit that's a deal! You should've grabbed me some. All though that doesn't beat the 9 different pain relievers I have in my meds cab.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-09 16:46:06	Had to call the police on the neighbor's last night. After 3 hours of their music thumping, I just couldn't take it anymore.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-09 17:41:11	Remind me not to take any more advice from said friend.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-12 04:22:05	@seamusdever AMAZING! Ryan and Esposito are on fire this season. Can't stop laughing. Saving ep in DVR, to watch over and over again.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-25 19:39:23	Today must be @seamusdever day. So far I've watched an episode of NCIS and Cold Case with him, then #Castle tonight.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-14 01:13:27	Pure Country 2.......WTF??
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-31 04:28:05	Having a Horrorthon. Currently watching "A Nightmare on Elm Street" while I paint my nails. Got a little sidetracked with the World Series.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-10-31 23:07:34	@Mia Is this from our trip, or do you just keep going back??
54436265	itsrynie	2010-11-02 03:29:15	@Mia didn't read that correctly, and was left wondering why the fuck you were playing dominoes. Iz SLOW today.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-11-04 04:10:24	Think I should do better than yesterday, and go to bed before 2:30 am
54436265	itsrynie	2010-11-04 04:14:18	@Mia what happened to my pic of the babies??
54436265	itsrynie	2010-11-09 00:56:09	@Mia OMG in my dreams I'm SO RICH I live out there!!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-11-09 03:41:40	OMG, watching Hawaii Five-0 and Balki is on!!! I love some Bronson Pinchot.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-11-10 00:44:03	I'm so freaking tired right now. I could lay my head on my desk and not get up until my shift starts tomorrow morning!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-11-14 18:01:34	WOW, I have 1.7 hours of just #BonJovi in my iPod!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-11-14 18:10:14	Anybody for hire?? I really don't want to clean my house. Can't pay a lot, but will cook and bake for you.....
54436265	itsrynie	2010-11-17 05:43:46	Love how the temp drops into the 50's and people start wearing their big winter coats, scarves, gloves and hats. Come on it ain't that cold!
54436265	itsrynie	2010-11-17 06:37:24	@Painz exactly! At the most the 50's is a zip up hoodie. Idiots.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-11-21 07:56:32	Rhinestone with Dolly Parton and Sylvester Stallone??? How have I never heard of this movie before?
54436265	itsrynie	2010-12-11 21:27:31	Is bagging groceries a lost art form??  Everytime I leave the store, I have to rebag everything in the car.
54436265	itsrynie	2010-12-22 02:51:13	@Mia I would totally do Alaska or Greece
54436265	itsrynie	2010-12-31 12:17:33	@Painz Thanks! I hope your Christmas was a great one. I'm sure 2011 is going to be kick ass.
54436265	itsrynie	2011-02-03 01:09:55	@Mia Fuck if I know, and I would not call myself a twihard
54436265	itsrynie	2011-02-13 01:07:35	@Mia send me a pic of what the ones you ordered look like. I love these ones those, they are purtty!
54436265	itsrynie	2011-03-06 22:17:06	Watching #Chopped and this dude thinks that Rocky Mountain Oysters, are actual oysters. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!

54436265	itsrynie	2013-01-16 05:37:50	@AudraArenas just for you babe, and only you... I have returned
54436265	itsrynie	2013-01-17 02:19:38	Being sick sucks. Been cooped up for the last 6 days. Never thought I'd actually miss work
54436265	itsrynie	2013-01-17 04:24:04	@AudraArenas it wouldn't be so bad if my head didn't pound 24/7. Then I would be catching up on some much needed reading.
54436265	itsrynie	2013-01-17 04:27:19	@AudraArenas again I love your positivity!! But know what? It does suck giant donkey balls! That would've been the perfect job
54436265	itsrynie	2013-02-02 01:52:11	@AudraArenas you know me so well, but you better believe I watched the BonJovi video the day it came out!
54436265	itsrynie	2013-02-09 19:16:46	Couldn't ask for a better birthday! Spending time with great friends, having some good drinks and a lot of fun
54436265	itsrynie	2013-05-07 03:06:54	@AudraArenas anytime Chica! I got tons more to help you get through the work day tomorrow
54436265	itsrynie	2013-05-07 03:22:40	@AudraArenas Unfortch, most are SFW. I promise to include some nice quotes to make them entertaining
54436265	itsrynie	2013-05-07 21:07:09	@AudraArenas You wouldn't believe how many pics I actually found! Also I love to be your enabler
54436265	itsrynie	2013-05-29 00:47:01	@AudraArenas OMG this is what I had to go to Twitter to read??! Major let down
54436265	itsrynie	2013-06-02 22:01:22	@AudraArenas well I'm glad you didn't ditch Kevin altogether! Was Aaron just a fling?
54436265	itsrynie	2013-06-02 22:05:25	@AudraArenas His abs? His chin dimple?
54436265	itsrynie	2013-08-23 22:09:39	Is summer in Texas over with yet? It's almost too HOT for a girl to shop!
54436265	itsrynie	2013-09-09 20:29:55	I swear #MetLife is the absolute worst. If I had a choice, I'd never do business with them personally
54436265	itsrynie	2013-09-14 16:51:51	So ready to go home. Love my Parents, but tired of being held captive. 5 more days to freedom!
54436265	itsrynie	2013-12-04 02:54:58	#VoiceSave Matthew
54436265	itsrynie	2013-12-28 15:54:59	34 coming up around the bend. Think I'm going to do a BYOB paint class, even though I can't partake of the BYOB 😫. It will still be fun!
54436265	itsrynie	2013-12-29 01:55:19	Watching cheesy 70's and 80's slasher movies on Netflix, curled up on the sofa with my girls and my @MinkyCouture blanket. My kind of night
54436265	itsrynie	2013-12-30 01:08:36	Dad is so cute! Calling to make sure I check the roadways for ice in the morning. I'm 33 but he still manages to make me feel all of 16
54436265	itsrynie	2013-12-26 15:55:27	@AudraArenas come back to work! I'm cold, bored and there is only so much music I can listen to. My IM is lonely
54436265	itsrynie	2013-12-30 12:20:35	2 days of work to get through, before I can enjoy vacation time! http://t.co/cj0MOE4C3F
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-01 03:52:52	It's not even 10pm and I can barely keep my eyes open. Contemplating bed, I'm sooooooooo OLD!!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-01 06:31:06	2014...... It's going to be an interesting one! http://t.co/ui9kY8gwd9
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-01 15:20:49	I really miss the days of sleeping in! My body no longer allows it. I guess 2014 will be a more productive year! http://t.co/yLUnGzMIqq
54436265	itsrynie	2013-12-30 19:05:16	Just ask and you shall receive. Due to the ice storms and 2 missed days of work w/out pay, my check was short....
54436265	itsrynie	2013-12-30 19:06:32	I was scrambling to make sure everything was going to get paid, but just found out I won the drawing to take $200 off January's rent!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2013-12-30 19:22:33	You got to love this crazy dog! http://t.co/DmITQlO5I3
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-01 18:36:11	Hopefully all the drunkies are at home sleeping off their hangovers. Contemplating running around town, should I or should I not?
54436265	itsrynie	2013-12-31 01:23:14	And it just gets better, apartments called and it's $250 off not $200! I can live with that mistake
54436265	itsrynie	2013-12-31 01:41:47	Being brave and going out in a limb and trying a new flavor. Loved the last new one I tried #syntraxnectar http://t.co/LGufgz82LP
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-02 00:10:29	It's been almost a year and half. Don't know why I hang on to these pics. I miss my Red Thunder #RIPCar http://t.co/dpeCTy8Gig
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-02 00:18:58	Most important thing, I was able to walk away, well really limp/crawl away. Miss that car so much, the new one feels like someone else's car
54436265	itsrynie	2013-12-31 11:49:33	I have strange friends! But I guess that means I fit right in http://t.co/OxysA8gWoJ
54436265	itsrynie	2013-12-31 19:22:50	And this guy seems to be the winner painting for the BYOB Paint Class/Birthday party. Can't wait to have some fun http://t.co/4CSs6U0yxA
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-01 00:14:21	You couldn't pay me to go out on NYE! Heck I almost got in a fight in the car yesterday. Staying home reading and watching movies tonight
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-02 16:58:42	Me thinks I was a little hasty in turning the heater off! Currently bundled up in a blanket trying to blow dry my hair. ❄⛄
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-02 18:49:49	Was in quite the quandary as how to pay @Target after having my last debit card shut off. I said F-it an paid with the debit. It's safer now
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-02 22:02:11	Feel like I ran all over town today, and I'm doing it again tomorrow! These vaca days are going by way too fast
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-02 22:34:54	Just ordered my #Nectar sample pack from @SyntraxProducts. Can't wait to try some of the flavors I haven't had a chance to test out!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-03 00:11:05	@HarvestSnaps just found these bad boys today and they are the BOMB! Must find more, great chip substitute http://t.co/KSaLtcOpiA
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-03 03:54:57	Trying to explain to a friend why I've never watched Up. I mean I ugly cry through 3/4 of Armageddon, what would Up be like?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-04 18:41:08	Reason 112 not to be friends with family on FB. Post a recent pic of yourself and insight a debate of if you look like your cousin
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-03 05:38:11	Just watched the #VeronicaMarsMovie trailer, and the only thing I could say was, NOOOOOOOO not with Piz!!! Can't wait until 3/14!!!!

54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-06 03:42:11	DVR'd the original #StarWars trilogy today, now I just need to find time to watch it. I really need on DVD, my VHS ain't cutting it
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-06 12:35:28	I've only been up for 30 mins, and haven't even made it to work yet, but I miss my vacation! I like waking up when my body is ready to
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-06 12:48:04	I'm sorry, too cold for me! And of course I left my jacket in the car. Going to have to make a mad dash for it http://t.co/0CHJqWO4ZJ
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-04 05:47:43	Jurassic Park at the Chinese Lantern Festival http://t.co/z5mTpBEtiv

54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-04 05:51:32	I've been up and on the run since 9am and it's now almost midnight. Still frozen from being outside for 3 hours and beyond tired. Bed time!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-06 15:26:30	Now that the new year has arrived, maybe I can hear something back about one of these 4 jobs I interviewed for in the last month
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-05 17:38:36	Back to work tomorrow after 5 days off. That went by way too fast. Trying to decide if I should be productive or lazy today?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-06 19:18:00	Luckily I got a special project thrown at me this morning, so it's making the first day back go by fast. Sad part, I just finished it
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-06 00:19:42	I tagged a friend in the pic months ago on FB. Today that same friend shared this pic in a pin. #meantobefriends http://t.co/bEdBRBg4Fk
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-04 21:01:46	Kind of excited! Got invited to go on a trip to Orlando this summer. Never been to FL and haven't had a proper trip since 10/2011.
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-07 17:57:04	It was so hard to quit my bed this morning! I was all warm and snugly. Just a tad bit late to work
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-06 00:58:19	Made a compromise 70/30 on laziness/productiveness for today. Read 3 books, took a shower and did 2 loads of laundry. Who am I kidding 80/20
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-07 19:17:41	So this year we want you to head up the ___ committee. BTW the first meeting is today at 2. Book the room, send meet req and bring agenda
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-07 19:18:33	Love how I get roped into these things, with only a few hours of notice!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-04 23:52:44	I am highly entertained by @ericstonestreet Christmas Tree vids, and sad that I didn't think of this first many years go
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-07 00:11:01	Bad thing about going to Orlando with my much older cousins.... I'm not going to be able to go to see HP. I have 6 months, time to sell it
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-08 01:32:12	To put the flannel sheets in the bed or not, that's the question of the day. I might never get out of bed with the flannel sheets
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-08 02:33:31	I had a hard time quitting #Chopped tonight, that is until #TheMindyProject came on! Welcome back guys, I missed you!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-08 17:28:36	I'm over today already! Overslept, late to work, left my protein shakes at home, productivity off due to late arrival an have to stay late
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-08 19:06:21	My New Years Resolution is to try different things and be adventurous. #myfreshstart. Already on my road to healthy, so new resolution
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-09 00:09:53	People just want to push my buttons today and make me be tacky with them! You get what you give people
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-09 04:04:01	Beautiful purse my friend bought for me at the Chinese Lantern Festival last week. Just need an outfit to go with it http://t.co/N0RJ6lFetg
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-09 15:57:53	People argue about the stupidest things! You're going to give yourself a heart attack. Learn how to LIG, Let It Go!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-09 18:50:12	Some dude at work just told me he like my necklace, touched it and said it makes me look like a million bucks! LOL http://t.co/QqHritioDk
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-11 15:54:45	Up at 8am on a Saturday, what a waste of perfectly good sleep time. Guess I should think about being productive today
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-10 00:14:36	Exactly one more month till my birthday! Bring it on, I'm ready for 34.
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-11 21:29:53	Why did I think the grocery store on a Saturday afternoon would be a breeze?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-10 12:45:17	Made it to Friday! Jinxed myself last night thinking I hadn't been "sick" in a few months. So of course I threw up last night! Just my luck
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-10 12:49:41	Charlie and her nasty, disgusting Kiwi number 45. I can't find them anymore, so when I can wrestle it away,wash time http://t.co/xQ6s5qgh7b
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-10 19:18:08	Should I go to the Irving #ZestFest in 2 weeks? I'm not into crazy spicy food, but it sounds like it could be fun!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-13 01:05:07	So true. I'd rather regret the things I've done and said, than regret the things I didn't do or say http://t.co/QNjXLpxVgn
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-10 20:55:24	Hate when your Dentist/Dr changes something on you, and now they won't do something that they used to.
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-12 18:25:29	Got a Freebirds burrito bowl yesterday, and I swear I've only been able to eat maybe a 1/4 of it. Definitely getting my money's worth
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-12 20:25:03	Watching @SleepyHollowFOX with John Noble, makes me miss #Fringe
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-11 01:43:15	Have to call @UPS, my packages are MIA!! Tracking says not delivered, but got a notice on the door they were delivered to the apt office
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-13 04:50:09	Had to take tomorrow off, cause the shipper requires an adult signature and @UPS will only deliver to me, not apt office. So not happy
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-12 04:09:52	I may or may not get emotional and cry, when someone deserving wins #Chopped. I can be such a girl sometimes
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-13 14:09:36	@UPSHelp @UPS I already had a lengthy email conversation with Jane on this issue on Fri. It got me no where but having to take today off
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-13 16:55:07	Stuck at home bored out of my mind, waiting on these packages! Hopefully they will be delivered sooner rather than later. Then I can get out
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-13 17:15:57	Anybody else's dog like to block the cable box when your trying to use the remote, or is it just mine??? I swear she does it on purpose
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-13 20:13:55	And the wait was worth it. Either Merry Late Christmas or Happy Early Birthday to me!! Can't decide which it is http://t.co/dlN0htbs3M
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-15 02:18:16	It's like Christmas over here, 2 packages yesterday and 1 today. I just wish Santa was footing the bill!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-14 12:51:24	I know it's only January, but can I get week off? I better be careful what I wish for, before I get that and more!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-16 01:52:00	Making mashed sweet potatoes with parmesan and chipotle. Doesn't look amazing, but tastes great http://t.co/5yAORoQNtN
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-18 15:40:52	Got home late last night, up early this morning. Not a good combo! I just want to stay in bed and sleep
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-16 12:52:06	So let's hope today at work is less stressful. I some how luckily survived getting laid off, but 10 of my co-workers in the dept didn't
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-15 12:47:54	I've been a fan of @MindyProjectFOX since the start, but bringing in @adampally was the best decision! Peter fits into the crazy like an OG
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-18 19:50:30	Lunch with my Daddy! Eating some yummy Jamaican food. http://t.co/28tJ49xhJu
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-18 22:28:26	Dad told me as we're leaving the restaurant we need to take a selfie. He's so hip now http://t.co/Qwf7GIwu7K
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-19 00:38:35	Ok so the other one was definitely a late Christmas present and this one is an early Birthday present!Thanks Groupon http://t.co/xbL9GEeCr9

54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-18 05:24:52	Girls were not happy I left them at home for 15+ hours! They may not let me leave tomorrow without throwing a fit
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-19 20:07:24	Love me some football, but don't always watch. However, gonna watch these games today and see who I need to support come Super Bowl time
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-15 20:26:02	Wow, I was scared there for a few hours, but I've survived for now. No telling what the future holds. Definitely need to get out of Mortgage
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-19 22:08:02	Not looking too good for the Pats! Looks like the Broncos are going to be headed to the Superbowl. Still have the 4th quarter to get through
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-20 00:20:49	Hmmm, not quite sure I'm rooting for in this game. Always been a fan of SF, but there's something about Seattle that draws me in
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-20 03:49:24	I need to stop watching #CutthroatKitchen and go to bed, busy day tomorrow, but I can't stop! This show just might trump #Chopped
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-20 04:22:51	And now #Twister is on! I may never get to sleep tonight.
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-20 16:33:03	Going to see my fav dentist Dr. Roy at my fav dental offc @21CenturyDental and get my chipped filling repaired. No more pain when I chew!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-22 23:57:06	Just chopped some jalapeños and even though I just washed my hands, must remember "DO NOT touch my eyes"!!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-20 23:55:14	Tooth all fixed, visited vampires and gave some blood, now trying to enjoy what's left of my day off. Back to work tomorrow
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-24 02:50:20	@LUVBBW I would give anything if you'd turn #ParisDaydream into a lotion and bodyspray scent! I have to sniff the candle everytime I walk by
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-24 12:47:49	Having a girls night tonight, with my ladies! Been a few months since I've seen some of them. Ready to have FUN!!! http://t.co/jyo5esZgew
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-25 00:13:47	Got my new iPhone, so glad. I was completely out of memory on the old one. Kind of like @sprint new upgrade policy, maybe, kind of
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-25 06:09:09	@AlamoDFW had an awesome time at the #JTDanceParty tonight with my girls!!! So much fun
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-27 03:45:19	Just shot shower gel up my nose trying to smell the scent! I guess at least my nose is clean and has a nice Shea and Almond smell
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-28 01:02:03	Some how decided to throw some random stuff in the kitchen together, and am now making black bean cakes sans recipe. Wish me luck
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-29 03:15:15	When is Apple going to invent functional earbuds? I now have 4 sets from various devices, and I loathe them all.
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-29 12:47:30	Cold outside, very warm snugly bed= plans to go into work early completely blown! In fact, slept late so going into work late. Oh well
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-31 13:52:59	Super Bowl Sunday this weekend. What to make, what to make? Party I'm going to is Mexican themed, so thinking Sopapilla Cheesecake and Salsa
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-01 20:29:06	My Dad is such a slow texter! I've been looking at the 3 dots for like 2 mins. It would be faster to just call me http://t.co/a5orsM287P
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-01 22:40:14	Kroger was a hot mess today! And since when did people fail to realize when the light is off in the lane, the lane is CLOSED?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-29 21:59:43	My Fox sweater has now been mistaken for a "Kitty" twice. I'm going to need you to learn what a fox looks like http://t.co/clz7QV9oV6
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-30 11:44:11	Up early this morning, listening to Daft Punk, chugging Tylenol for cramps and getting ready for work, when all I want to do is lay down
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-02 01:44:25	Why am I so terrified of opening biscuits in a can? Was there a mishap in my childhood, where I was hit by a rogue can?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-31 23:23:16	@Target had some good sale stuff today. Got 2 pair of converse sneaks and a long sleeve v-neck tee for $28. And to think I almost didn't go
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-30 19:27:03	I may need to think about having my @jamesavery ring resized before I lose it http://t.co/broQcYG00g
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-30 19:29:42	@AudraArenas I like how you haven't been on Twitter in months, and this is what you come back with
54436265	itsrynie	2014-01-30 20:47:57	@AudraArenas but you &lt;3 me that way!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-01 11:38:09	Was thinking I need to buy garlic for my salsa, and random thought popped in my head.... If I was a vampire I'd miss eating garlic. WTF?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-02 15:27:04	And party time in 6 days! A few years ago I stopped doing nothing in my birthday, and started celebrating. Best times http://t.co/6idfmY3b1u
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-02 18:59:01	Super Bowl Sunday, cheesecake made, ingredients for salsa bought, team to cheer on picked, outfit ready (such a girl), and time to head out
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-02 21:28:10	Well Anita dropped the ribs on the floor. We're calling them dirty ribs, yum http://t.co/V7CbyCe5g0
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-03 02:08:11	Don't know what everyone at this party is complaining about, game is going great as far as I'm concerned #LoneSeahawksSupporter
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-03 03:57:52	@AudraArenas that's what we said and still ate them!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-03 03:58:39	@AudraArenas I was pulling for Seattle as they were the underdogs and never won one. But your right, closer games are better
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-03 05:41:20	Why not try, it never hurts to try #EsuranceSave30
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-03 06:07:55	#EsuranceSave30 these people RT and tweeting every minute..... I'm calling in to work tomorrow, but I still ain't got time for that I'M OUT
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-04 19:11:46	5 months post-op today! Never thought I'd be where I'm at today, especially after those first few painful weeks. It gets easier and better
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-03 19:47:38	@AudraArenas did my naughty Disney Valentines text not entertain you?? I took an unplanned day
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-03 21:10:27	&lt;3 this face! My little independent girl, who doesn't like to cuddle, is currently laying in my lap. #PuppyLove http://t.co/lBiXTVOnik
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-05 01:16:43	What is it about rain in TX that makes everyone forget how to drive? This isn't LA, it actually rains here sometimes
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-05 02:57:09	Love all my friends so much, but if another one asks what I want for my birthday, I might go crazy! I have no clue.
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-06 12:28:00	No white stuff on the ground, guess I have to go to work! It's not like they would close the building. It's my Friday, 4 day weekend for me
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-05 19:24:14	A lot of people find it disgusting, but I love me some Seaweed Salad http://t.co/R5rGCFIv7a
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-06 20:52:33	And I spoke too soon http://t.co/iWYozC05vn
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-06 22:25:55	Some crazy nut hit my car this morning and kept right on rolling! She didn't realize I was crazy enough to chase her for 2 miles
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-06 23:46:17	At least she didn't do too much damage http://t.co/OO5c8y1yBE
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-09 06:03:57	5 hours ago I was ready to paint a masterpiece for my 34th birthday...... http://t.co/hlIQZgg50m
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-09 06:05:09	.....but then this hot mess happened!! I'm definitely have no artistic ability http://t.co/7mbNKCBF9N
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-07 14:17:43	After being hit yesterday morning, slipping, sliding and jumping the median yesterday afternoon, slightly scared to get back out on the road
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-07 22:51:37	Short hair again! Loving it
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-08 16:09:32	Busy day today! Early b-day lunch with my Parents, then dinner with some friends and finally my b-day party. Not doing a darn thing tomorrow
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-09 19:53:14	So busy the last two days, just going to chill and do nothing on my actual birthday. May actually get out and run some errands later, maybe
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-08 21:19:44	My Dad has upped his selfie game, since a few weeks ago http://t.co/zYHs2dIaE1
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-09 23:34:31	@AudraArenas you should be! Even though it's my birthday, I got you a gift. The gift of the return of The Walking Dead
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-09 23:35:52	Dear Olympics, I just can't seem to quit you! All my plans for the day, have gone out the window
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-10 04:04:02	After watching all this ice skating, I feel the need to watch The Cutting Edge. #Toepick!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-14 12:25:59	I made it to Friday, even though I only worked 3 days this week, it was a long one! I actually have to work 5 days next week, wish me luck
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-15 13:40:39	Up way too early, so I can be in Richardson for a cake pop decorating class by 10 with a friend. This should be very interesting
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-15 19:41:44	Didn't turn out too bad, although Anita's were a HOT MESS http://t.co/MB4fGtkfHG
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-19 02:04:42	Need to hunt for my dress slacks for an interview tomorrow. Don't know where they are in this mess of a bedroom
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-17 13:03:12	Had a dream last night that someone I haven't seen or spoken to in years, just suddenly reappeared in my life, poof. No explanation, nothing
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-18 12:09:27	A big thank you to my neighbors, for making tons of noise and keeping me up most of the night. I really appreciate it assholes
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-22 16:12:02	Getting ready to make a trek to Downtown Ft. Worth. The things we do for those we love
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-23 04:37:27	Finally tried some calf fries, after wanting to try them for years. Not bad, but Dad still ate most of them http://t.co/lA0Rpbw64p
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-24 23:25:06	I think literally broke out in hives. Hate this place. Hopefully it's another 5 years before I have to come back http://t.co/F5zMxGBs2f
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-25 23:39:03	Angry bathroom selfie. Was trying to hurry and take a pic of the shirt for a friend. So no posing or smiling http://t.co/gQLFKJNKIs
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-26 00:33:56	Bought my ticket today for my FL trip this summer. Southwest kept jacking up the price while I was trying to buy them! But so excited
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-27 12:30:02	I swear the older my Dad gets the more ornery, stubborn and argumentative he becomes. Having a conversation with him is like going 12 rounds
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-24 19:47:24	What do you mean this isn't how you eat a hamburger? http://t.co/Z1rJuejcSX
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-01 22:40:59	@AudraArenas cute, but NO just NO! Stick with your Tiffany's
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-01 01:20:57	Look what I got! Belated birthday gift from my sistah from another mistah, who left me this summer and moved to NO &lt;3 http://t.co/4i9SzMaLU9
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-01 01:28:17	@AudraArenas aren't they! She knows me so well. Kitchen paraphernalia, hot pink and leopard
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-02 15:34:57	Turn on the heater, turn it off. Turn on the AC, turn it off. Turn the heater on again. I hate a Texas summer, but come on already!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-02-28 12:43:14	Got to love the screwy weather in Texas. Turned out the heat yesterday and today turned on the AC
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-02 23:48:01	Curled up on my sofa with my @MinkyCouture blanket, trying to stay warm in this cold weather http://t.co/bs6XtHojEs
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-03 03:11:19	Thanks Time Warner Cable, trying to watch the Oscars and all I seem to be getting is this pixelated hot mess http://t.co/jKpuQ9urwZ
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-03 04:12:17	@AudraArenas of course I'm watching! And your hubby always looks dashing! Did you see him in the epic selfie from Ellen yet?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-03 04:15:20	@AudraArenas have you seen the other one, where everyone's face has been 'shopped with KS's face?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-03 04:16:58	@AudraArenas I just RT'd a few mins ago
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-03 04:23:15	@AudraArenas I thought you might like that
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-03 04:30:26	@AudraArenas I think I've seen him more than Ellen
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-03 04:58:57	@AudraArenas knew he was going to win and I would've been disappointed if I didn't hear alright alright alright! Must watch Dazed nowb
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-03 05:04:52	@AudraArenas I must have FF through that part
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-03 05:07:33	@AudraArenas I heard that, put thought maybe that was his pronunciation of Idina Menzel
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-04 01:32:17	Did I just spot @fortunefunny on 2 Broke Girls, playing a Sherlock loving lesbian?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-05 02:30:12	@AudraArenas well if you don't count yesterday, I'm all in this week!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-05 02:00:59	@AudraArenas not sneaking out early any this week?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-05 02:04:05	I should remember this more often. It would help me stay positive and let go of residual anger http://t.co/ocaIeVYUdM
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-05 00:24:04	@fortunefunny great seeing you in something besides Chelsea Lately. Hope to spot you in some other stuff
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-05 00:37:45	6 months today! Never thought I'd survive those 1st 2 months, it was so rough. It definitely gets easier with time http://t.co/4aueGWdr9B

54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-07 02:13:51	Got some major love from 3 separate people at work this week! Almost made me cry. It's nice to know other people think you do a great job!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-07 02:16:29	@AudraArenas you might still get it! I got some inside knowledge on another upcoming post. Remind me to tell you tomorrow
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-07 02:27:10	@AudraArenas yes but it's nice to hear it, especially from people you haven't worked with in YEARS
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-07 02:27:37	@AudraArenas don't forgot I'm coming in late tomorrow! Ha
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-09 02:23:29	Ran into some Wookies at the Brahmas game. #StarWarsNight http://t.co/dP6tBhIpbY
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-10 23:24:31	Wonder how long it's going to take to get used to the time change? Almost slept through the alarm this morning, and been TIRED all day
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-14 15:36:54	I think a pregnancy test is advisable http://t.co/6EbdTJ9ooZ
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-14 18:01:14	Oh HELL yes! Groupon has Medieval Times tickets for $29. I am all over that
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-12 01:16:06	Had enough Thank You points to get this! First time I haven't gotten a gift card with my points http://t.co/GYLf1Ndlro
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-14 00:41:03	White Cheddar popcorn dipped in green onion and chive cream cheese, is amazingly delicious. Don't ask me how I know this. Stoned or pregs?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-16 17:38:10	And this is how Charlie is the most comfortable, chilling on the couch. I was lucky and got one corner to myself http://t.co/G6pjrq0Mkf
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-16 14:36:00	Love the rain, but hopefully we got it all over with yesterday. I got errands to get done today
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-16 18:29:31	Errands all done, DVR time now. Going to get caught up on Hannibal
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-15 19:13:21	When is this epic storm going to get here??? I'm waiting for the thunder and rain to roll in
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-17 22:36:09	Not a Star Trek person, but I love this http://t.co/27vvkfzZmz
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-18 01:54:49	I need someone to put me out of my misery already! Becoming more anxious with each day that passes. Ugh, hate how things take forever
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-18 13:49:55	I've been up since before 5, at work since 6:30. All this so I can leave early on Friday. Already have a headache. I can do this!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-18 22:44:41	It's about GD F'ing time!!!!! @AudraArenas
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-18 23:54:16	It would be great if my phone would discuss this issue with #TWC. My wifi is spotty at best and always has been http://t.co/CsW1Kcj9UU

54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-20 00:33:26	Start my new job on 3/31, so just this week and next to get through. And since I'm leaving early Friday and off on Monday, should go fast
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-20 10:53:54	Hopefully it's my last day of waking up at 4:45 am and starting work at 6:30. Going to miss the up front and close parking
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-20 11:09:17	@AudraArenas from what I've heard, it's not at all. I've never really had trouble with it since I've been in this job
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-21 11:28:48	@AudraArenas on it #Conchita, walking out the door now. Had to cover up these  crying bags
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-21 11:06:29	Why do I want to read these @BuzzFeed  articles I know will make me cry, while getting ready for work? Ugly crying= nothing getting done
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-21 19:12:04	Well that was a fun drive up 35 to Denton! Time for my 6 month post-op visit. Then more fun driving on 35
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-21 22:54:17	When I said buy out the store, I meant it. These are the snacks you buy/bring when the birthday girl is a popcorn fan http://t.co/fZN9wRCLCq
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-21 11:10:17	@AudraArenas @BuzzFeed at least it was one of those "will restore your faith in humanity" posts. So it was good crys! #Conchita
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-22 13:47:47	Up late last night, restless sleep, and now up early for b-day party that starts at 11. Soooooooo tired. Need to get my butt in gear
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-22 14:13:19	B-day party 10 years ago was a hot drunken mess, this year a pottery painting class. Early 20's vs Early 30's. As Dad says I'm an old lady
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-21 17:22:31	About to go buy out this popcorn store, for party time tomorrow. 19 bags, 16 flavors and $50 later, hopefully it's worth  it
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-22 19:43:34	My beautiful masterpiece before the final process. Have to wait a week to see the finished product http://t.co/R2QMUMfOG1
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-24 12:49:43	Off work this beautiful Monday, but still up too early. Taking the Silver Bullet in to get her mirror fixed, finally.
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-24 14:02:27	So pissed right now! Why make an appt 2 weeks in advance #ServiceKing, if you aren't going to order the part prior to the appt?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-24 01:06:33	@AudraArenas WTF?? Stop RT'ng Ebola shit! I'm a hypochondriac who has seen #Outbreak one too many times.
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-24 01:21:30	@AudraArenas doesn't mean I won't be thinking about getting it Conchita! All it takes is one monkey to get loose
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-24 00:22:49	Watching #foodcourtwars and they filmed at the mall down the street from my house. More pissed Tiffany did a mall concert and I didn't know
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-25 11:30:08	Mornings like these, when I'm so bone tired, I wish I still drank diet coke. Would love that shot of caffeine. Soda/Caffeine are now no gos
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-26 21:33:47	@AudraArenas ha this better be a joke, or I will be calling in for the rest of the week
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-26 21:37:00	Going to try Service King again and see if we can really get the mirror on the Silver Bullet repaired
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-25 19:36:33	Only took almost 7 months, but my insurance finally approved the claim for the hospital! I guess they didn't want to give up that 129K
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-26 02:53:17	Even if @AudraArenas doesn't believe me, Salt &amp; Vinegar popcorn is the BOMB! Hence the empty bag http://t.co/pC2sJk5MBy
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-26 18:02:49	@AudraArenas NEGATIVE Conchita! They better keep that shit north of the border.
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-26 18:03:28	@AudraArenas why did I douse my hands in sanitizer, as I was reading this???
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-29 13:55:35	Woke up to the sun steaming in my windows, and thought I slept in late for the first time in months! Looked at the clock and it's only 8:50a
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-26 21:33:10	@AudraArenas @tamibiyo not as much as Target!

54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-28 11:40:46	Last day of work!! New job starts Monday, can't wait. Have a feeling I'm not going to be so productive today
54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-28 01:33:54	There are a lot of decisions/choices I've made in my life, that I wish I had done differently. But I have no regrets http://t.co/SK1chGWAFp

54436265	itsrynie	2014-03-31 23:22:46	Got my retinas scanned today at work. What did you do?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-01 02:34:02	@AudraArenas when are you going to get this for the kids? Disney movie nights in the backyard http://t.co/JuKS6Mgb3s
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-01 16:39:38	@AudraArenas you can get in the main entrance with your badge, but the side entrances only have retina scanners.
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-01 16:40:24	@AudraArenas I need to hook up with my friend to get it. Long story there, but was supposed to have it last weekend
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-01 16:41:05	@AudraArenas I can definitely tell you're off today! Catching up on everything, including Twitter
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-01 19:02:26	@AudraArenas poor Ava. She looks so sad
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-03 03:08:51	@RosieLondoner isn't this Custard, that magically showed up in my FB news feed? He does great charity work! http://t.co/zzESUKbz6A
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-04 11:42:06	My new/old co-workers are throwing me a "surprise" welcome to the team breakfast this morning. I was copied on the email, so no surprise
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-02 11:32:30	@AudraArenas oh poor baby girl! I'm sure she enjoyed her day with Mama though. And now she can have a nice day with Daddy
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-02 01:37:54	@AudraArenas when I saw the CDC I just knew this was going to be another damn Ebola post. Thank Jeeves it's not
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-04 22:06:25	I think I've been initiated into the team! http://t.co/llB0JGQcbA
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-04 23:39:11	I could watch #TheMummy on a continuous loop 24/7. Why? I have no clue, but love it any way
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-05 12:20:22	7:15 am is way too early to be up on a Saturday!! The sun's not even up yet. This much hated car is giving me issues, so in it goes
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-05 12:39:26	@AudraArenas who has an early morning birthday? Oh......you I'm guessing? 😳 Got to fit it in between all that baseball!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-03 22:09:27	My Dad just told me he has gone to the dark side. As far as I know, he's not a #Jedi so I don't know what he's been smoking today

54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-06 03:06:27	@AudraArenas as long as Ian had fun, that's all that matters

54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-06 19:42:26	This rainy weather is making for a LAZY day. Curled up on the couch in my pj's under a warm blanket, catching up on my DVR of @NBCGrimm
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-09 22:44:41	@AudraArenas of course I have so much faith in you! I've known you for 11 years and know what you are capable of. You can do this job!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-11 10:35:17	Why didn't I get the memo, that everyone was only working a half day today??

54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-10 13:47:54	I don't understand parents that drive their kids to the bus stop. You might as well drive them the whole way. Guess I was spoiled!

54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-12 21:36:21	Told my Dad my "cocaine" fell out of my purse when he opened my car door. He didn't even bat an eye. Hopefully he knew it was protein powder
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-12 21:37:36	@AudraArenas looks about how I imagined it
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-13 01:24:41	@AudraArenas 🙈🙉🙊 I can believe it. Oh well you'll be back home tomorrow
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-13 02:37:20	Why am I just now learning there is a #LawandOrderUK? I would so watch the shit out of that. Oh well, probably can't get it over here!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-14 11:13:48	For having never read or watched #GameOfThrones I know too much about what goes on, on the show. Another great wedding it seems
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-14 11:32:25	@AudraArenas I know nothing of #TheWalkingDead still, and haven't watched #Up either. 😳 I know, beat me
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-13 22:31:12	Ever achieved something and wish a certain someone was there so you could share it with them? You celebrate w/others, but it's not the same
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-14 23:29:43	#BizarreFoods Dallas tonight, followed by #BizarreFoods Houston. So watching that. Who knows, I might be brave enough to try something out

54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-22 13:36:39	Love how I woke up 30 mins earlier than normal, but left for work at the normal time. What did I do for those 30 mins?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-22 15:10:17	I'm so picky about my fruit, but who knew @ChickfilA fruit cup was so good? Not this chick! 🍎🍏🍊🍓 It could use some grapes though
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-21 17:37:04	A little shorter and layered in the back for Spring. Sheena's been cutting my hair for 6 yrs, no one else can touch! http://t.co/KCsifiwhBX
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-24 23:10:08	This is my left over Chipotle from lunch! I was so hungry, but took 2 bites and was done. Guess what's for dinner? http://t.co/nZeQ3SZjRj
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-25 00:45:05	My friend V has been begging me for a month to make my Slutty Brownies from @RosieLondoner. I finally caved! 🍪🍫🍩 http://t.co/kjnR3CbHFn
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-26 02:04:06	So glad #Unforgettable survived, love this show! Dylan Walsh has been in some amazing things, but my fav will always be #Congo.
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-26 03:00:17	I have become totally obsessed with popcorn in the last month. I think I've met my match with this Jalapeño Ranch popcorn. Mouth is on 🔥🔥🔥🔥
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-26 03:01:42	@AudraArenas I know I already said this, but AVOID at all costs. Unless you like dill pickle watermelon flavor. Smells and taste NASTY
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-23 11:41:14	"I can’t drink you away. I’ve tried Jack, I’ve tried Jim. I've tried all of their friends. But I can't drink you away" some JT this morning
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-26 13:47:23	I swear my 2 dogs live to sabotage me! Wanted to read this weekend, so plugged the Kindle in to charge. Guess who unplugged it?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-26 15:06:25	@AudraArenas I'm going to stick with my Fruit Punch. I'm terrified to try any other flavor
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-23 22:53:28	@AudraArenas yes total BS excuse! And Nash doesn't really use it either, just a bit. Really hope this person 💣💣💣💣! Then they will regret it
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-23 22:56:43	The office Martha Stewart, made these beautiful lemon mini cupcakes. The photo doesn't do it justice. http://t.co/v62cst6tjL
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-26 17:40:35	I almost spit out my drink watching @Jon_Huertas doing the "hood slide" on @Castle_ABC ep That 70's Show. Not quite up to Bo Duke level
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-25 11:38:43	@AudraArenas have fun on Ian's field trip. Take some pics and tell me how it is. Trying to see if it's something I should check out
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-25 11:40:31	Going to go see #Oculus tonight with a friend. But I'm so tired this am, don't know if I can make it. I really really want to see the movie
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-25 11:50:05	@AudraArenas @Advocarestore hello! I plan on testing the watermelon when I get to work! Just don't know if it's going to help, beyond tired
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-25 11:57:52	"Bitch type in grammatically correct English,then I will understand" Every time my friend gets mad when I don't understand her texts/emails!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-25 12:01:23	@AudraArenas LOL!! That would never be you! I can't decide if this friend is a bad speller or awful typer. But she MAD when I decipher wrong
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-26 23:57:12	Someone is curled up in my blanket with me! http://t.co/5CV6XUwdwT
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-25 14:02:24	@AudraArenas you are always grammatically correct
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-25 14:08:46	@AudraArenas trying this Watermelon now! Hopefully it tastes good http://t.co/b2G9cA56xl
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-23 14:38:50	A chef used this Dr Suess quote on #Chopped last night, and I've always loved it http://t.co/j9jadzcUnQ
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-24 11:22:41	Up early again today, although I'm sure I will leave at the normal time. Wondering what the office holds for me today? Crazy I'm sure! 😜😁😎
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-24 12:44:40	@AudraArenas that's my old friend of many years Conchita. Don't know if you've ever met her or not? She's the 🐝knees
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-27 13:45:48	Thank you Sprint for the 8am reminder text to pay my bill, and a double thanks to my dogs for not letting me go back to sleep! 👎💤😞⚠️✖️
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-24 15:54:32	Just took my last bite of breakfast 🍵 and already trying to decide what's for lunch 🍗
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-28 14:47:38	Since the time change, the 🌞 just keeps coming out earlier and earlier
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-27 19:36:03	I'm dying! Not literally but close enough. Feel like I drank milk, but know I didn't. One of the very few down sides of my surgery
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-27 19:38:01	@AudraArenas I need this to wear to work! I swear this is me every day. It just a continuous cycle http://t.co/8WrWGJyMSo
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-29 11:51:44	Bringing it back to my high school days with this one, this morning. Zombie by The Cranberries. So many memories! http://t.co/bOzwqhOivz
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-28 17:44:28	@AudraArenas I just figured you took another day off! And you're slow, the day is almost over with now 😜
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-28 18:18:13	I guess I'm neither brave, strong or happy, cause I can't seem to be the first to do these things. Working on it http://t.co/EFcUY0pNww
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-29 17:45:54	Starting to get slightly irritated I don't have all my system access at work. Going into my 5th week. Ready to get to it on my own
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-28 22:38:40	I'm pretty sure I just murdered my vacuum cleaner. Turned it on and it started smoking. Going to operate and see if I can revive. 💣🔫🔪💊🔨💉✂️🚑🚨
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-29 22:42:37	Interview later this week for a PT job at Charming Charlie. Not sure if a good idea! Goal is to pay bills off not spend my paycheck!!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-01 12:02:31	It's May 1st in Texas and it's currently 48 degrees. I didn't sign up for this cold weather!! Where is my warm weather at??
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-01 14:41:08	@AudraArenas first day I'm really on my own all day, and you're not here!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-01 18:52:27	@AudraArenas you need some rest, then some daily vitamins after that
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-01 22:05:23	Interview time. Let's see if I can get this PT job and pay off these bills
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-30 01:06:24	Ever taken 2 Tylenol but immediately forgot that you've taken them? Currently deciding if taking another 2 will be good or bad? 🚨🚑🏥💊
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-29 12:03:18	Really hate blow drying and flat ironing my hair! Thank goodness it's short and doesn't take that long. So glad I got rid of the long hair
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-30 11:38:37	To all my friends: I 💜 U very dearly!!Even though I'm up at 6:30 am during the week, don't call me that early. I won't answer the phone
54436265	itsrynie	2014-04-30 21:10:15	Tried @myfitfoods today for lunch. Great concept and even better food. Can't wait to come back and try some more meals
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-02 16:41:31	Starving!! Going for Thai food today and ready to leave. Waiting on a co-worker to get done with this last minute meeting
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-04 20:03:38	Love the Google doodle today. Happy Birthday Ms. Hepburn. They don't make 'em like you anymore 🎉🎁🎈🎂🍰 http://t.co/QxjQqJm5bd
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-05 00:53:06	All caught up on @Resurrection, and just in time. The season finale starts in 8 mins. Can't wait to see what happens
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-05 03:32:11	@AudraArenas it wasn't too hard luckily. Had a craving out of no where, did a little shopping and got an iced tea, then forgot about it
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-05 03:52:32	@AudraArenas ack! Don't tell me anything! Haven't gotten to it yet, and probably won't for awhile
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-05 15:18:45	Starting the 2nd job tonight! Working 8-4:30 at job 1 and then 5:30-9:30 at job 2. I'm going to be tired tomorrow.
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-04 14:46:48	May the 4th be with you http://t.co/DLCJaFQBea
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-04 17:11:09	I can't help it, but every time I see the trailer for #Godzilla, I must shout out GODZERRA!! I'm terrible, I know! 🐉🐲
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-05 19:32:37	Wish I could have a drink! I would be all over this. Today is for sure a Monday http://t.co/5BLrd1m68c
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-04 03:52:44	Don't know what I've gotten myself into, but 2nd job here I come! 💰💴💵💷💶💳
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-04 22:59:15	I've now watched #Jaws and #Jaws2 3 times each in the last 2 days! Thanks @AMC_TV. I just couldn't change the channel http://t.co/RIwSo4xBAR
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-04 23:30:05	I was really craving a Diet Coke/Soda today! I fought it hard, but won. It's been 8 months without one. I've come too far to give up now!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-05 02:41:44	OMG, my jaw literally dropped! Was not expecting that ending. Season 2 needs to hurry up and come on!!! @Resurrection
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-06 11:15:18	At this point, I've had less than 6 hrs of sleep, and I'm sooooo tired! I feel like today is going to be a cranky pants type of day
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-06 11:16:35	@AudraArenas yuck, not a vodka type of chick, unless it's mixed with something. It was The day of your people yesterday, pour tequila!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-06 23:55:37	Taco meat browning ✔️ chicken boiling for a Mexican chicken salad ✔️and innards half way done for stuffed jalapeños ✔️. I'm on a roll
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-08 14:45:38	I thought today would be the first time in 2 months, that I wouldn't have to fight with the retina scanner, since the sun wasn't out. WRONG
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-07 11:17:31	Stuffed jalapeños straight out of the oven. Sausage and bacon on the right, and cheese on the left for non 🐷 eaters http://t.co/9Nqjr5HWMz
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-10 04:43:21	I just want to read my @pitnb but the X-Men ad is cock blocking me. No way to close out of it. Hate when this happens http://t.co/Elmrj0qLMi
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-11 15:43:54	Missing my Maverick today. She was a 4lb handful, but she loved to cuddle, lay in my lap and belly rubs. Been 18 mths http://t.co/LFYio0lIHk
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-10 19:54:28	I would rather drive 25 miles to work and back to pick up my protein powder, than use the protein powder I have at home! That's sad
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-11 22:45:02	Happy Mother's Day to all the Mom's, but most especially mine! http://t.co/nbTHfa68jg
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-10 21:34:04	Yesterday this is what I find in my office, when I came back from washing my cups. http://t.co/ldPU9niTyP
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-12 11:42:27	Obligatory bathroom selfie. My Dad wants to know why I don't just flip the camera. T-Rex arms= no full body shot http://t.co/NfZvY11sol
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-11 02:21:13	Obsessed with @sugardrama website. Been stalking all the recipes and bookmarking all day today. Not helping my sugar cravings at all! 🍪🎂
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-13 03:03:16	I was all like "Yay this season finale of @Castle_ABC is going to be funny and have a happy ending, with no cliff hanger!" Boy was I wrong
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-14 12:00:44	@AudraArenas I might share my last cookie with you, if I still ate cookies! I'd definitely share my last Spark w/u! http://t.co/oHopdaMoj0
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-14 15:12:34	These Ch(IPS) are the bomb! Both flavors I've tried are great. Just need to find another place that sells them http://t.co/f2FyzNPGNM
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-14 18:56:17	The Thai Peanut Turkey Lettuce Wraps from @myfitfoods is amazing! I need to stop by and grab some more.
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-16 00:51:57	So tired I can barely keep my eyes open! But my body and mind refuse to lay down in the bed. Busy busy weekend, need to get some rest
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-15 02:35:47	Ha! Ran out of frosting for my work cake. Had to run to the store. Salt now in hand. Asparagus roasting time!!! http://t.co/ax3GbO2bKq
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-15 16:12:31	A friend asked me to come over Fri night, hang out and paint her toes. I know that's a girly thing to do, but kind of weirdos me out, no 👣
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-15 00:25:50	I bought some thin asparagus at the store and was so excited to come home and roast them. But I don't have any damn salt anywhere!!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-16 02:31:31	I may be 34 but I always check the closet for Dracula and behind the shower curtain for Norman Bates. Some things from childhood stick w/u
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-17 00:21:12	It only took me 2 months to get it, but this turned out to be a HOT MESS! http://t.co/oloNfforns
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-17 14:15:55	Off to visit my Parents today. I hate longer car trips by myself, so boring! I guess I will be doing Car Karaoke the whole way.
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-17 19:48:46	Thought I saw a dead #Kangaroo on the road, the realized this isn't Australia, it's Texas. Just a deer at an awkward angle
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-18 20:12:12	I accidentally just snorted powder foundation. I may never recover and am sure to be traumatized for life!!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-17 20:27:46	Roasted asparagus, fried potatoes and onions and sautéed mushrooms by me. Country style and baby back ribs by Dad http://t.co/NaFyUhBOwy
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-19 01:56:53	Must remember to get up early tomorrow. Must remember to get up early tomorrow. If I keep repeating it maybe I will actually remember!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-19 11:37:35	I remembered to get up early! Time to drop this beast of a car off a the dealership, for more repairs. It's no secret I HATE this car 🚗🚘🚙
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-20 11:42:12	They say if you can't beat them, join them. I've joined the pranksters at work, but I also plan on beating them. Epic prank underway!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-21 00:52:55	Had tons of fun at work today decorating Mr Prankster's desk. Can't wait to see his reaction or how he pays me back! http://t.co/fjje7py1TX
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-20 17:29:20	Finally got my Spark this weekend! Boy was I needing it. I'll make sure I don't run out in future http://t.co/cIXwma7zOd
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-22 02:06:45	I don't know how I did it, but I haven't watched a single ep of @cw_spn this season. I will be having a SPN summer! http://t.co/4wVR5oUJRh
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-22 11:35:44	Anyone else's dog go nuts, throw a fit and try to "attack" them, every morning when they get in the shower? No, just my wild and crazy pup..
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-24 14:42:46	Wonder why I can't sleep like I used to? 😁 Sleeping till 9am is now late for me. Doesn't matter what time I went to sleep, up by 9am. Ugh 😡
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-23 17:40:19	So Happy Happy, it's Friday and it's a 3 day weekend http://t.co/p0YupTtdoU
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-24 15:55:04	I may have just ordered a tub of Spark last week, but ordered some more. Making damned sure I don't run out! http://t.co/z0Y8FFBDfM
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-24 22:08:13	Anyone else OCD about the red notifications? Hate to see them and must clear them immediately. http://t.co/pzi2GnBIUJ
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-25 03:03:30	@AudraArenas still can't believe this! I could see baby girl fighting before A!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-25 16:59:12	Watching Labyrinth, not the awesome David Bowie movie, but the miniseries. My interest is quite piqued thus far. Might have to read the book
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-25 19:24:06	“@BuzzFeedFood: 28 Badass Burgers To Grill This Weekend: http://t.co/9Q3AlTAf0p http://t.co/Vm9G7D7a3l”
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-25 19:31:04	This was my lunch Friday. This burger is legit the best I've ever had. If you're in DFW check out LA Burger in VRanch http://t.co/NMC1wtx13Z
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-28 02:18:14	I had a dream about scorpions the other night. They started out microscopic in size, but each time I killed it a bigger one would appear
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-26 00:25:36	It's pretty much summer in Texas, but I'm cold, so I have an oversized sweater on over my pj's. Could turn down air, turn off fan, but no!!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-28 02:41:05	@AudraArenas used to see them all the time at my Parents, but I've never actually killed one. Don't know what that dream was about!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-26 01:54:15	@BuzzFeed as far as I'm concerned, the cutest http://t.co/PiDItIKwmd
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-26 16:26:19	Remember today is more than a day off work, grilling and drinking beer. Thank you to all who have or are currently serving our country. 🇺🇸
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-26 17:35:27	Cleaning out my files, and found a bunch of address labels from MOD. Good thing about living in the same place for over 6 yrs, still good
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-26 18:08:21	I'm sorry, but a well done prime rib is a serious crime against food. For that fact, a well done burger or steak too.
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-28 11:20:28	All 9 texts from the same person, within about an hour. Stalk much? And then they going to wonder why I don't respond http://t.co/fUiZkhbMfS
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-27 00:13:20	Ugh sometimes I don't even know why I bother. Enough to drive me insane. There must be a dude out there I can tolerate that will put up w/me
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-28 13:56:29	So according to my google research, dreaming about scorpions is a sign of fear, a prediction of danger, self destruction or about a Scorpio
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-28 13:57:58	But I much prefer the Islamic interpretations, killing scorpions = money will go, then come back
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-28 13:58:59	And killing yellow scorpions which these were, mean making a good investment that will show profits. Much prefer the Islamic interpretations
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-27 11:16:20	Fair warning people, I'm not in the mood to put up w/ any BS today. Didn't sleep good, up earlier than usual and really cranky. Spark time!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-28 18:25:39	Slightly nervous to get my test results at the Dr today. But I was worried last time and everything was ok. So I'm sure it will all be good
54436265	itsrynie	2014-05-28 22:31:37	last time I made @RosieLondoner Slutty Brownies for work, the pan was gone in 20 mins, this time they asked for 2! http://t.co/JFJGCHN6sS

54436265	itsrynie	2014-11-17 02:41:46	Slightly jealous of all my friends from Ft Worth posting their snow pics on FB. Not even one tiny flake here in Lewisville yet. Soon I hope

54436265	itsrynie	2014-11-19 13:28:14	I've been on Pinterest for over 3 years and have only had a handful of pins. In the last week I've developed a serious addiction! Need help!

54436265	itsrynie	2014-11-24 03:39:49	Last Sunday very cold and snowy, mid week in the 70's. Yesterday torrential rain and an earthquake. Today windy as hell. Texas weather smh
54436265	itsrynie	2014-11-23 17:12:17	Noticing a pattern: make plans to be productive on Sat = end up not doing anything. No plans made for Sun = run around all day long

54436265	itsrynie	2014-11-25 13:22:53	Hope some more people come to work today, but they won't. Looks like I'll be watching Netflix and listening to music while working
54436265	itsrynie	2014-11-25 14:38:24	@AudraArenas don't hate, that's why you get paid the big $$$$. My job can be done while entertaining myself, therefore little $$$$

54436265	itsrynie	2014-11-26 01:39:59	@AudraArenas feel ya, me too! Although mine stems from having a hard time sleeping at night
54436265	itsrynie	2014-11-27 01:00:16	It's 7 pm and I've completely finished all my Thanksgiving dishes!! Now I can relax for the rest of the night
54436265	itsrynie	2014-11-28 14:45:31	I hope work is slow today! Maybe I will finally be able to get caught up with things around the house
54436265	itsrynie	2014-11-27 14:50:32	Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Safe travels and don't eat too much http://t.co/ynXrOElMgZ

54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-04 03:47:23	@AudraArenas I'm so glad I didn't have to do that! I don't know I could've made it! I guess the good thing is if you eat, they postpone
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-04 03:07:22	10 more days and I can rid myself of most of this hair!! Never have I looked more forward to a haircut than this. Pixie cut here I come

54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-05 07:24:01	@AudraArenas of course you would be! Maybe you should be writing it instead of reading it
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-05 08:26:10	And I'm still awake and have now seen EVERYTHING on the Internet twice now
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-05 12:53:28	@AudraArenas I ended up getting some where between 2-3 hrs of sleep! So tired I need SPARK NOW!!! Also ended up sleeping a little late

54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-20 17:38:23	My Dad has now asked me what I know about Netflix. I have a feeling I'm going to spend my Christmas Eve explaining and showing him Netflix
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-20 22:46:38	I had to buy the egg nog and I will just have to drink it, even though it will make me sick. Don't know if I can trust the dairy-free nog

54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-23 12:49:41	What's w/this wet stuff? The Universe just knew I had to carry a huge heavy pan of peach cobbler into work. Either the cobbler or umbrella?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-23 16:50:25	So this inadvertently happened today. Takes coordination to a whole new level http://t.co/Mp2I3zdnfU
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-24 12:41:33	Just because I'm working remote today, doesn't mean I'm off. I need to get that in my head. Got to get ready to head to my Parents
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-21 20:27:42	@AudraArenas I wish you could, but it's a more do the time type of thing. I know how miserable you are, but you will soon forget it all
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-24 03:29:02	Can I find a laptop bag that doesn't look like a laptop bag, is cute and decently priced???
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-25 06:38:35	Merry Christmas to me. At only 10mins into the day, I was hugging a trash can. Wish I could say it was from drinking, but it's sickness 😷🙊
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-26 17:17:15	Should've stuck with my plan to work from home today. So boring at work, I might fall asleep in a minute!! 😴😴😴
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-26 18:56:40	Found this in a junk drawer at my Parents house. Christmas Card 2008. I remember taking it the year before http://t.co/TpjywZehv0
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-26 19:33:18	@AudraArenas is it bad I don't even have a copy of it? I have the original pic used, just not a copy of the Christmas card
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-27 05:50:20	Gentlemen, "Do you have a boyfriend?" Is not a good pick up line. While its a vital question, don't use that to pick up women
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-27 16:07:02	Lunch today with an old friend I haven't seen in almost a year! Can't wait to spend some quality girl time together
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-28 00:44:00	Got a Roku for Christmas and have been binge watching season 2 of Vikings all afternoon. This thing is awesome!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-29 03:16:29	I don't know if it's a good or bad thing, but the thing I most look forward to on Sunday night is going to work on Monday morning
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-29 17:15:10	Next time separate bags!!!! I keep trying to shell the almonds like pistachios and eat the pistachios like almonds http://t.co/T9dLIyCEMz
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-29 22:35:04	They need to regulate the temp up in this office!! I've been cold, then hot, then cold again, then hot and now I'm back to cold!! ❄️🔥❄️🔥❄️
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-29 22:44:52	Whiteboard inspiration http://t.co/UMV3SOKg9G
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-30 16:39:42	@AudraArenas lol I can be that! I'm going to work from home the rest of the week after today, so I will get on top of it
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-30 16:52:46	@AudraArenas hey I'm on ep 3 of the first season, so I think I'm half way done with it
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-30 00:45:32	My Charlie always has to have her paw on my shoulder when I'm sitting on the couch http://t.co/rGcsnGfGu9
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-30 15:28:55	@AudraArenas I have it on Netflix at my hands 24hrs a day! And now with my Roku, I can watch it on my tv. It's on my list
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-30 15:34:38	So apparently another earthquake this morning in Irving. We can never feel these at work. Guess I work in the wrong part of Irving
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-30 18:52:11	@AudraArenas I know I know, but I really plan on watching it, or at lest getting through the 1st season
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-31 00:45:30	@RosieLondoner love it! It's now so much easier to read on my iPhone
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-31 03:31:36	Well it only took how many years.....5?? But making progress with watching TWD. Nearing the end of season 1
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-31 18:37:11	@AudraArenas look now one thing at a time!! I need to get through TWD first
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-31 16:39:48	I got my laptop, my Spark, a bowl full of various proteins and the Roku playing TWD. What more does a girl need?
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-31 16:54:31	@AudraArenas I'm starting to warm to that idea
54436265	itsrynie	2014-12-31 22:13:39	Love how everyone else got to leave work early, but me! That's ok though, it's slow, I'm at home curled up on the couch watching TWD
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-02 03:34:35	In the last 2 days I've watched 33 episodes of TWD. I'd say 2015 is off to a good start
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-02 18:11:23	@AudraArenas I think it's too much at one time! But I ain't going to stop.
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-02 14:26:07	@AudraArenas why am I dreaming of living in a post apocalyptic society with zombies???
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-03 00:59:07	Always said I'd make homemade marshmallows when I got my Kitchen-Aid Stand Mixer. Had it 2 years now and have yet to make my marshmallows
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-03 16:02:50	@AudraArenas nope already checked when I realized last night! Going to have to buy the eps from Amazon. But have to wait till payday 😭😁😕
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-03 16:08:08	@AudraArenas sorry I CAN'T wait that long!!! It's going to kill me waiting until Friday! I'm totally hooked and going through withdrawal
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-03 16:12:28	@AudraArenas omg I will die!! I guess I will have to go back re-watch during that time
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-03 06:46:37	@AudraArenas SUPER PISSED, my recordings of season 5 didn't record!!!!! What am I going to do now, sombitch!!!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-04 01:06:46	@AudraArenas it took awhile but I finally got with the program
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-06 13:29:57	@AudraArenas Get off that fence girl!! Either she's dead or she's coming back. And you've spent way too much time convincing me she lives!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-06 04:26:14	Why do I have to fight every night with my little 8lb dog, who gets the whole other side of the bed, to stay off my side. It's my bed!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-06 17:22:42	@AudraArenas that's right!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-06 21:20:47	Don't feel left out now, finally felt the earthquake at work in Irving. Actually knocked over some stuff  on my desk http://t.co/1QJXYfFPsG
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-06 21:54:31	@AudraArenas it was pretty strong, 3.5. The glass walls on my cube were shaking. 6400 feels them all the time, but we don't
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-07 01:04:56	Dang what's up! 2 earthquakes in one day and I felt them both. That first one rattled my brain and gave me a killer headache.
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-05 15:56:38	As much as I loved working from home last week, it's good to be back in the office with my family of weirdos!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-07 19:07:24	Thinking I should finally make that peanut butter cake I promised my co-workers. Just need to find my recipe
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-08 03:02:25	@AudraArenas exactly, we're going through withdrawals!! Just wait till this weekend when I am catching up on 5. I'm going to text like crazy
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-08 13:34:28	I'm confused. Do I live in Texas or not?? Can I call in at Work, because it's too cold to leave my house??? http://t.co/29pw6Tsc1o
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-08 15:42:15	@AudraArenas this is true!! Always forget I have that option! And 2 people already called on today, I would've been in good company
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-08 02:47:50	What mine and @AudraArenas texts have turned into!! And it's hilarious!! We have another month to entertain ourselves http://t.co/53mxn0K0c4
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-08 18:07:42	Wore a sweater yesterday and roasted in the office. Thin long sleeve shirt today, and I'm freezing my ass off. Can I get the temp regulated?
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-08 18:08:47	@AudraArenas I know! I've been checking it obsessively. I guess I will finish Cabin in the Woods. The fam might appreciate the laundry
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-08 18:42:12	Made a decision, I'm no longer going to be afraid of being rejected. I will be brave and find the courage to say the words owed to you
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-08 19:22:40	@AudraArenas I can't remember if my back hurt after or not! I was in so much pain that first 6 weeks, I probably couldn't differentiate
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-09 16:14:28	1 more month until I turn 35! 🎊🎉🎁🎈🎂❤️
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-11 01:34:31	During my week long all 5 seasons of The Walking Dead bender, I really let my DVR get outta control!! I need to pay it some attention
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-09 19:18:51	Can't decide what I want to make for the Cowboys game on Sunday. Queso Blanco? Tortilla Soup? Jalapeño Poppers? Dessert? Too many decisions
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-10 00:41:20	My age is catching up with me!! This is my reminder to take alternate route to work Monday. http://t.co/lt6AjRMTP0
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-10 01:22:22	@AudraArenas and the season 5 marathon of TWD is starting in ...5, 4, 3, 2 and 1......
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-11 05:34:29	Why does the Cowboys game have to start so early tomorrow??? And yes, as far as I'm concerned noon is early
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-10 20:43:14	Going to go run errands all over town. Wonder how long I can avoid B&amp;BW Semi-Annual sale?? It's going to be hard!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-11 00:24:36	@AudraArenas I am and I love it!! There's some good things to being mid 30's! I'm old and I know it
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-11 00:25:02	The force was not with me today! http://t.co/TwhxQgy1HG
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-11 15:34:05	Didn't make it to the store, too tired to do anything, so my friends are out of luck! No homemade treats for the game, just gourmet popcorn
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-12 16:38:32	This Monday morning meeting is killing me! We've been talking about the same topic for 40 mins!!! And it's only the 2nd bullet point of 21
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-11 23:21:41	Somebody was having a rough day at the Kroger in Coppell http://t.co/4ol6QVuIAc
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-11 17:46:51	Car selfie before the Cowboys game. Made it to Anita's safe and sound. Wet out there but no ice!! http://t.co/DJysJ13gW2
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-12 19:03:34	How come this combo of checked shirt, jeans and booties gets me called a cowboy? Is it just cause we're in Texas? http://t.co/XshVcc262a
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-12 01:41:41	Just had to listen to my Dad talk about the show he was watching, all about legal pot in Colorado. Really a whole convo about pot??
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-12 12:23:40	Creepy when someone comments on a photo you posted to FB, but they aren't your friend, you don't know them and you have no mutual friends
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-12 12:26:48	Today's white board inspiration http://t.co/cMwfYlqMvY
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-13 12:46:06	Took me 54 mins to drive the 10.5 miles to work yesterday! Wonder how long it will take today? I hate construction
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-13 15:11:21	@VitaminShoppe used mine already, to double up on my protein and vitamins! http://t.co/suBytGGCjG
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-13 16:15:09	It's an AC/DC type of day today http://t.co/JLK0OlGeGA
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-16 01:39:50	Dreams are strange little things. Had a dream 2 weeks ago that my Dad's dog Honey passed away. Got this text earlier http://t.co/h56BBBfob8
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-16 01:53:51	@AudraArenas lol, omg, lmfao, bwahahaha. There aren't enough phrases to describe my laughter
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-14 18:43:16	I was bored, then @AudraArenas and my texts evolved into memes of @bigbaldhead and now I'm entertained http://t.co/o45tawJZ2z
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-14 19:39:58	@AudraArenas for sure nothing wrong with it!! Kept me going at work
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-15 02:17:16	I swear I'm getting real tired of his shit!!! Who thought it was a good idea to give our Parents smart phones http://t.co/XG9WFmDa7x
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-14 01:55:09	It took me an hour to drive the 10.5 miles from work to home earlier. Is someone going to hurry up and get on with inventing teleportation?
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-16 12:45:55	Shout out to my friend Anita, who has a 2nd interview for a promotion today!! Good luck and fingers crossed, you got this girl!!! 🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-15 17:26:53	I hate dressing up! I've never been so ready to wear a pair of jeans in my life.
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-16 16:04:29	Wearing jeans today feels like FREEDOM!! 🎉🇺🇸🎉🇺🇸🎉🇺🇸 http://t.co/Rqe3dlieTo
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-15 17:52:45	@AudraArenas big wigs in town since Tuesday! Although they've yet to stop by our side. So ready for jeans tomorrow
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-15 17:53:39	And....@AudraArenas I've been so wrapped up in TWD, Beth Lives and Bethyl that I completely forgot about Oscar noms today
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-15 18:15:56	I'm thinking @bzsalads for lunch. Craving some veggies. Got to wait for the lunch crowd to die down. Maybe another hour and half
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-15 18:17:12	@AudraArenas iknr?? Hopefully I would've remembered the actually Oscars, if I didn't remember the noms!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-15 22:45:10	@AudraArenas a Hot Redneck sounds like such a dichotomy, but #DarylDixon is that and more!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-15 22:45:37	@AudraArenas I know we live for the Oscars, at least we used to!!

54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-17 00:54:56	4 day weekend!! Can't wait to do absolutely nothing!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-17 02:10:34	@AudraArenas or I could watch all 5 seasons of TWD, cause I'd be wide awake
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-17 03:59:47	I like my protein shakes icy cold!! So made just a few of them to have on hand http://t.co/1SOYGuCAWk
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-17 05:55:20	@AudraArenas might be a little too soon for that. It will take you a bit to find your rhythm with food again. Took me a good 8-10 weeks
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-16 17:49:43	That awkward moment when a song comes on and you tell your friend you've been listening to the band all day and she doesn't recognize AC/DC
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-16 18:31:59	It be cold up in this office ❄️❄️❄️. Good thing @SaltgrassSteak is around the corner. Thinking baked potato soup for lunch to warm me up
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-16 19:18:38	@AudraArenas you can do it!!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-18 17:51:47	Up by 8; vitamins, protein, breakfast, showered and dressed by 10; grocery store and back home by 11:20. Feeling accomplished this morning
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-17 01:41:15	I'm pretty sure if I drink one of these Spark right now, I could stay up and clean out the 36 hrs of shows in my DVR http://t.co/k2qdl4z4mH
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-17 03:20:43	@AudraArenas working on it! But all I really want to do is watch TWD
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-17 03:24:30	@AudraArenas I need some more good ones! I'm going through withdrawals. And none of them are updating
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-18 18:54:58	Cows milk is killing me!! I need to stop being so cheap and buy the almond milk
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-18 19:28:18	So this just happened. Looks like I'm heading to NOLA in May!!! Can't wait, is it too soon to be excited????🍤😜🍺☕️🎉 http://t.co/5lMAx01QxB
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-19 03:54:47	My Dad can never remember what channel @tcm is on, so I told him to favorite it. He said ok, let me find my pad of paper and pen!!! ❤️ him
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-17 19:03:49	I need to be productive and get up and go to the store, but I don't want to!!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-18 14:10:42	I swear I'm dragging my lazy butt to the grocery store today, no excuses
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-19 20:56:26	Crazy dreams last night...dreamt I witnessed several plane crashes within minutes of each other. Wonder what it all means?
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-18 21:51:55	Seattle is killing me with this game! 🏈🏈🏈🏈
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-18 23:24:01	I don't know if my nerves can take this OT!! Come on Seahawks!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-20 16:07:32	Watching TPIR on my day off, takes me right back to my childhood and staying home from school sick. The one thing I looked forward to
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-20 16:35:15	Wonder if I can get through the whole day without someone from the officer calling or texting me????
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-20 18:30:54	This little brat is pretending like she doesn't know how to jump on the couch. Currently whining, begging&amp; scratching http://t.co/lyivSXXiJV

54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-21 01:01:22	4 day weekend was nice, kinda sad to go back to work, just cause I know there's a hot mess waiting for me
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-21 12:14:23	BOOM! I got busted last night. You guys know you can't resist that last scroll of FB, Twitter, Pinterest or the netz http://t.co/VEUZ0W5jdy
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-22 02:41:00	My protein, food and water intake for today sucked. Need to do better tomorrow and not get so wrapped up in work
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-22 06:53:59	Can't seem to shut my mind off tonight, but my body craves sleep. Going to need a Spark right away in the morning
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-22 12:19:05	Was able to snatch a few hours of sleep. Not really feeling it yet, but I know the tiredness will catch up with me later
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-22 14:22:10	Hitting that Spark first thing, as soon as I got to work! http://t.co/dNnk3aTXk3

54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-23 10:33:10	It's 4:32 and I'm throwing in the towel, no sleep for me! Might as well get up, get moving and head into work early. I mean very early
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-23 11:03:37	Is it possible to feel so tired, without being tired? Is that a thing? Or am I losing my mind due to lack of sleep for the last 48hrs?
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-25 23:52:45	My friend bought me these and bought a pair for herself, and then said we're SockSisters. I worry for her sanity http://t.co/YKeXmUVMI8
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-24 01:03:03	I know if I let myself sit still for more than 5 mins, I would be out like a 💡But I've got too many things to get done tonight. Sleep later

54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-25 16:50:56	Donated a lot of my too big clothes to a friend and never realized until she pointed it out, but I owned a lot of purple clothes
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-24 01:51:37	So tired it took me 5 mins to figure out I had to undo the side buckles on my boots, before I could unzip the back 👢👢

54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-24 18:48:06	Well the old house appears to have turned into a drug house and then been abandoned. So heartbreaking http://t.co/fbjGUQl1Mt
54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-24 19:51:16	Do I got out with a friend and some strangers tonight to Dallas to eat and do Karaoke or do I go home and be lazy???

54436265	itsrynie	2015-01-31 14:24:49	Then I woke up at 7:30 am and said F-it, I will get up and get moving. Going to be a mixture of productive and lazy today

54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-05 20:40:09	I forgot how much fun it is to go shopping with a friend on your lunch break. It's great having a job with a flexible schedule

54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-08 22:19:10	Why everyone in the Thai place looking at me like "why's this little white girl in here"? Decided to wait in the car for my to go order

54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-10 19:12:24	The guy @advocare said I didn't look anything like my drivers license pic. Told me to keep up the good work. What a sweet guy!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-13 12:28:58	The struggle was real this morning. The bed was so warm and toasty I just couldn't quit it. No getting to work early today
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-13 12:51:21	And I just realized today is Friday the 13th! Hopefully the crazies aren't out in full force today. I can only deal w/ my crazy today

54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-14 21:06:39	I'm sorry but anytime Twister is on TV, I must watch it. I own it on DVD, but that doesn't matter. All plans now cancelled

54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-15 00:02:31	Don't know what I want for dinner. Craving a salad, Tom Kha soup or Mediterranean food. Too many decisions to make
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-15 20:11:16	@AudraArenas you're like a dog with a bone!! 🐶🍗5⃣🔟
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-15 20:17:41	@AudraArenas I wouldn't expect you to! But it was hilarious reading that tweet!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-16 01:02:45	Dad says be careful driving to work, snow tomorrow. I say I don't care if the zombie apocalypse happens, I'm off the next 2 days
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-16 17:32:35	I realize it's a lot colder in other parts of the country, but it's just too cold for me to function today. Good thing I'm off work
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-16 22:18:32	Before, I never really liked Greek yogurt. Now, I eat it at least once a day. Your tastes really do change after major surgery
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-17 17:50:46	Love it when she gets in these lovey dovey moods, but why does it only happen when I'm trying to do my hair?? http://t.co/sEz26NWjTJ

54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-19 00:45:40	Why whenever I want my Ropa Vieja recipe, I can never find it??? I swear it hides from me, when it knows I'm looking for it
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-17 04:01:32	It may be 30 degrees outside, but do I turn off the AC and the ceiling fans?? Hell no, sleeping in long johns with two thick blankets
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-17 14:51:48	Can't believe in less than a month, I have my 18 month follow up appt. Have to get lab work done today for the appt. Boo to 💉, HATE THEM!!!

54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-19 04:29:49	@AudraArenas figured it was time for a little change. It's always there to go back to at anytime
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-19 04:30:48	@AudraArenas I feel maybe I used to be normal and talked about normal people things. But not anymore..........
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-17 16:49:56	Who doesn't ❤️ getting these texts from friends? Could've asked me to rob a bank, and I would've agreed after that http://t.co/T323A2LEMd
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-20 01:43:26	W/out my James Avery ring for 2 weeks as I was having it re-sized. Back today, and I didn't go down enough in size!!! http://t.co/zPyXblaJ42

54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-20 22:57:11	One of my co-workers found a dildo in the parking lot of UPS at lunch yesterday, so that's all our conversation consisted of today!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-21 17:17:28	My own personal stash of Spark. I might have a problem! http://t.co/nrC8eSnCSZ
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-21 22:38:55	Lived the country life today. My step-brother let me shoot his rifle and it was a lot of fun
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-22 06:39:10	Got home at midnight, need to get up early and head to the store, before the masses descend. Thinking about just pulling an allnighter
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-22 07:21:02	Hard to believe I just hit 100K yesterday. I think I drove all over DFW today, or at least 239 miles http://t.co/IFKOPNI8YG
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-22 16:05:28	Feeling accomplished. Up before 7:30, left the house before 9, grocery shopped and back home by 10. Now both crock pots going. Bring it on
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-22 21:41:19	Still predicting ice and sleet, as well as bad travel conditions. Looks like I'll be working from home tomorrow. Ain't getting out at all
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-23 14:27:58	Why does everyone keep IM'ing me and asking if I'm in the office?? Do I look crazy enough to get out and drive on the ice?
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-24 14:17:12	Love that I can work from home if need be, but real tired of being stuck at home. Actually ready to go back to work
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-23 04:11:05	If I'm going to have to work from home tomorrow due to the ice, it would be great if my wifi would stop going in and out!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-22 20:46:50	Turned the heater on, got chili in one crock pot and a roast in the other. Pj's in the dryer and a book open. Ready 4 the ice/sleet storm
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-23 14:05:54	@SixSistersStuff give it another 24-48 hrs and it will be. We like to say Texas is bi-polar when it comes to the weather
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-24 19:21:39	It's on today! I actually used concealer and put on earrings and perfume. Feeling somewhat human. Maybe tomorrow I will put on shoes
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-23 18:36:13	Spending my lunch break becoming a productive member of society. Shower, makeup, hair and no more pj's. Putting on some real clothes
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-25 01:14:42	Getting real tired of myself and these four walls. I should've had a slumber party at a friends. At least I would've had entertainment
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-25 17:06:21	Feels awesome to get out of the house and back into the office. Especially great to get back to my fruit punch Spark supply!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-02-27 12:14:59	I swear every time I looked at a pic of that damn dress yesterday it was blue and black. Today every time I look it's white and gold!! WTF??

54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-08 21:50:08	Been obsessed the last few days with watching YouTube videos of Brits trying American candy and snacks. Now I want some British Sweets
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-09 13:34:52	Morning off work and I don't get to sleep in! There's something wrong here. Oh well, too much to get done this morning to be sleeping in
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-09 00:10:10	Able to get my hands on 2 of my fav British sweets. Nothing better than a Crunchie!!! @CadburyUK we need in the US http://t.co/SEA1RrStu8
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-09 16:19:23	I don't know if it's cause I'm always cold these days, but I'm kind of loving this 93 degree heat today ☀️☀️☀️☀️
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-10 01:23:38	@Duff_Goldman after watching Guilty Pleasures all I want to do is go to MD eat the Mega Threat at Charcoal Style and then go ride go karts!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-10 01:46:34	If you can pass up Twister any time it's on TV, you're a stronger person that I am. I don't care if there is just 30 mins left, I must watch
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-10 02:20:25	The struggle is real! Making a new strawberry shortcake recipe, and it calls for using the paddle attachment on my stand mixer- can't find!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-10 02:22:51	@maegwen such a great movie!! Glad there are other people that can't pass it up too
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-11 19:48:32	It's amazing how fast my hair grows in between cuts. Just 5-6 weeks later and it's too long for me. Ready to get it cut on Saturday
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-12 01:29:28	We've got way too much going on at work this month, and some how I'm in charge of it all. It's enough to make a person lose their mind
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-13 01:01:38	In the next 2 weeks, I have 2 baby showers, Father's Day, work brunch, team builder and sending gifts to my niece and nephew, tired already
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-13 04:12:22	I'm too tired to even get up and go get in bed 😴😴😴
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-14 21:02:59	I wanna hold your hand..... ❤️ it when she wants to be sweet http://t.co/qAEYjQmeWP
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-16 12:56:45	Crazy ass dreams last night! 1st I was involved in a shoot out with home intruders. 2nd witnessed a plane crash up close and personal!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-16 21:06:52	I want to go to Target after work, so tell this rain to STOP!! I didn't bring my boat with me today ☔️💦🏊🏻🚣🏻🚫
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-16 02:21:01	I suck at mid-year resolutions!! I will keep on trying to stick to them. I guess it takes time
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-17 13:02:59	Do normal people really look forward to getting their teeth cleaned?? Because I'm ready for my cleaning, just have to wait one more day!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-17 16:15:42	A lake has formed behind my car! If my wifi was working, I'd work from home. Time to go swimming 🏊🏻🚣🏻 http://t.co/K2HsDOlsp0
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-18 22:45:23	I'm craving something sweet now! I knew I should've gone and got a and-cone earlier! Oh well I'm in for the night now, sweet tooth will wait
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-18 00:24:41	This wind is so disrespectful!!! Loving the rain though
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-18 01:22:54	Not a good idea to take a swig of an ice cold protein shake, after just brushing your teeth!! 😱
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-18 11:00:30	Told myself last night, I'd get up early and go in to work a few hours early. And shockingly I got out out of bed 2hrs early!!!
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-19 21:53:04	Ready for a night out w/ my BFF. Going to shop till we drop,eat until we're sick, drink until we can't see straight and watch Insidious 3
54436265	itsrynie	2015-06-19 11:53:20	I'm not feeling today at all!! And of course it's one of those days when I leave for work, I won't be back till like 1am. Ugh.....…
