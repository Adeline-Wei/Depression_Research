548576829	al_prime_	2015-04-05 16:08:58	@o2 your data roaming is APPALLING. Can't do a thing on it, if you think you're going to charge me £1.99 a day I'm gonna flip! #NotHappy
548576829	al_prime_	2015-04-05 16:39:55	@O2 Malta. Iphone 5. Used it before abroad this year never had any problems. This time. DREADFUL!!'
548576829	al_prime_	2015-04-06 08:01:03	@O2 have tried that and still doesn't work properly. Can only get wifi in hotel. So unimpressed.
548576829	al_prime_	2015-04-06 09:48:01	@O2 go mobile. Nothing loads, can't update instagram, Twitter etc. data roaming is on.
548576829	al_prime_	2015-04-06 09:52:07	Proof that NOTHING good comes from attempting to shuffle when you're an intoxicated Easter Bunny 🐰😂😂 @GeorgeVine_ http://t.co/SdQuNccmL7
548576829	al_prime_	2015-04-06 10:17:13	@O2 yeah data isn't working inside or outside. Only use wifi in hotel and restaurants. Friend is on EE having no problems.
548576829	al_prime_	2015-04-06 10:55:20	FINALLY out of A&amp;E now to medicate with a beer... or ten 🍻 Some cast induced tan lines on the menu for @GeorgeVine_ 😂 http://t.co/1kkc6uhVxA
548576829	al_prime_	2015-04-06 10:56:42	@O2 yeah there is and that is off. It didn't make a difference. Back to UK tomorrow so it doesn't matter but will not be paying data charges
548576829	al_prime_	2015-04-08 16:29:25	@O2 been charged for the data abroad can someone contact me to remove these charges as data didn't work, had to use wifi. Not paying this!
548576829	al_prime_	2015-04-10 11:03:38	Walking to @HMRCgovuk Head Office would probably take less time than how long I've been on hold. THIS IS A JOKE!!!
548576829	al_prime_	2015-04-10 11:54:21	@HMRCcustomers finally got through
