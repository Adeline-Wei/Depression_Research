55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-30 07:34:43	Why am I still awake? Oh well. Overall goodnight!! Finding Nemo in 3D was awesome!!! 😁😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-27 14:25:58	Couldn't fall asleep last night for a long time. Only got like 5 hours of sleep at most. So sleepy. 😔Thank goodness for coffee! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-27 14:27:58	@EVanPeltAI11 Hope you feel better!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-30 22:32:54	Well that was kind of pointless. Oh well.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-30 23:54:45	Didn't realize @coltondixon was having twitter party! Maybe today will be the day I finally get a tweet from him!! Love you so much Colton!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-30 23:56:54	Didn't realize @coltondixon was having a twitter party. Maybe today will finally be the day I get a tweet form him! Love you do much Colton!

55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-30 23:59:49	@coltondixon I love you so much!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-01 00:00:12	@coltondixon Never Gone is amazing!! I can't stop listening to it!!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-01 00:01:14	@coltondixon You are so amazing!!! You truly are an inspiration!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-27 16:32:52	I'm getting really nervous. I should be finding out soon if I get to meet Scotty next week. I really hope I get the meet and greet.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-01 12:48:58	Blah... It's Monday. 😣 But just three more days until fall break!!! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-01 13:25:50	@coltondixon Me too!! I love October!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-01 13:56:48	Five days left of being a teenager!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-01 13:59:52	It's October! My favorite month because one I was born this month, two Halloween is this month, and I just love fall!!  🎉🎃👻
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-27 20:24:50	Well I guess I won't be meeting Scotty on my Birthday next week... I didn't get the meet and greet. Seriously about to cry now... 😢😢😢😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-27 20:31:29	Getting the email saying that I didn't get the meet and greet just ruined my day... I'm never going to get to meet @ScottyMcCreery. 😖😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-27 20:36:51	@hannuhbbyz Neither do I and I turn 20 next week.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-27 20:47:49	@hannuhbbyz Indeed!! Haha
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-01 15:58:59	You wanna know why October is the best month? Because @ScottyMcCreery and @coltondixon were born this month!! And so was I! 😃😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-01 19:24:40	Practice outside today.. 😣😔
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-02 00:08:22	My ankle is really swollen after practice. I guess I hurt it worse than I thought. 😥 I should probably get it checked out over break. 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-28 04:31:06	Bed time! 💤💤
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-02 03:56:20	I'm so tired all of a sudden. 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-02 04:37:24	Somebody just said that they thought that @Phillips and @ScottyMcCreery were the same person..... #SMH 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-02 04:52:22	Monster cookie! 😍😁 So good yet so many calories. #ohwell #yum  http://t.co/CChTmqwh
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-02 13:03:00	I'm to lazy to get out of bed!! But I probably should since I have to get ready for class... 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-03 02:58:33	@coltondixon Please pray that parents have safe travels on Thursday as the come back from England!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-28 19:23:22	It just hit me today that I have one week left of being a teenager. 😱
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-03 13:28:38	Yay! It's finally Wednesday!! After classes are over fall break begins!!!! 😄😄😄😄
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-03 14:02:42	So I didn't realize yesterday was #nationalboyfriendday! I I didn't post a picture of my boyfriend and me! ; http://t.co/FQ7j7nKx
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-03 14:56:04	So close!! #FallBreak
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-03 16:51:13	This would be my last class but I have to go to a freaking law school observation after this. I just want to be done for the day.. 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-03 17:54:09	I don't want to go to this law school class... 😔 #nervous
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-03 18:28:27	Sitting in this Law School class makes me feel like Elle Woods! 😂👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-04 01:00:22	I'm home!!!! 😃😃 Thank goodness for fall break!!! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-04 16:18:32	My parents are coming back from England today. Prayers for their safe travels.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-04 17:05:22	Laying in my own bed at home because I'm to lazy to get up.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-04 22:59:23	Thanks goodness you can order pizza online and not have to call to make your order otherwise i'd be going hungry. #shypeopleproblems
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-04 23:04:12	@ScottyMcCreery And we will make it that one go platinum as well!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-29 15:05:19	No home football game means I got to sleep in this morning!!! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-29 15:13:30	I don't want to deal with this right now... Boys/relationships are the worst sometimes....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-29 16:50:32	Fall break is so close! Just gotta get thought this weekend and three days of classes!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-29 17:50:57	Finally uploaded the idol tour pictures from the Cincinnati show and between those pics and the ones I took in Columbus I took over 800! 👍😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-29 18:37:32	Free food!! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-29 22:17:15	One of my roommate's friend's laugh sounds like she is stepping on a mouse..... 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-29 22:22:47	Colton during his set in Cincinnati!! One of the better pics I got during that show! 😊 http://t.co/lqGrv4ve
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-09-30 01:53:49	Going to see Finding Nemo 3D!!!!! Ahhhhhhhh! So excited!!! 😄😄😄😄😄
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-05 00:46:40	@ladd_sarah15 Why? As long as there is online ordering I have no need to. :P
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-05 00:50:25	Why am I so tired all of a sudden? 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-05 01:56:52	*crying* 😢😢😢😢😢😢 #glee
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-11 03:51:23	@ladd_sarah15 If it didn't require moving all my stuff half way across campus I would have. :P
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-11 14:29:10	Today would be my dog's, Mandy, birthday!! I love her and miss her everyday!! She was the best child hood do http://t.co/FPiPnW45
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-11 15:53:41	One test down. One more to go. Than doctors appointment later to get my ankle checked out... :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-11 16:49:56	@Phillips Yay!!!!!! I'm do excited!!! I can't wait!!! 😃
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-11 16:54:07	Both tests are done! Not sure how I feel about them though... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-09 20:42:21	@ScottyMcCreery What is we already pre-ordered it? Does that count as an early birthday present? Haha 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-10 04:00:29	Well this night went down hill really fast.. 😡😠😡😠😡😪
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-10 04:02:42	@ScottyMcCreery Happy Birthday again!! I really hope you had a great day!! Love you so much!! 💜 :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-10 13:52:58	I hope I pass this math test.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-10 15:04:07	I hate how I have four tests and a paper due all within the next week and a half. 😞 Is it time for the next break yet? #stressed
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-11 00:31:36	"It's shadier than a Walmart at 1am"
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-11 00:32:52	"It's like my soul set fire to Jesus" I hope nobody finds this offensive. My friend said it at dinner and I had to tweet it. Haha
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-11 01:51:29	Man my roommates can be freaking obnoxious.... It's getting really annoying. 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-11 03:11:48	Two tests tomorrow and they're back to back. Yup, tomorrow is going to suck... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-11 03:12:42	And I don't feel all that prepared for either of my tests. And I'm so tired right now that studying would just be a waste..
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-07 16:00:21	Seriously how hard of a concept is that to understand.... #annoyed
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-07 18:02:43	@ScottyMcCreery trying to give @BradPaisley bunny ears on the big screen in Columbus on 10/5!! 😊 http://t.co/UdeJUHa3
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-12 00:00:02	I have eaten to much on the last few hours and I still feel like I could eat... And I couldn't run today because of my ankle... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-12 12:47:37	Praise the lord it's Friday! I'm so glad the week is pretty much over. This is a much needed weekend. #TGIF 👍

55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-05 16:21:52	Can't believe I turned 20 today!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-05 17:02:30	I would love a b-day tweet from Scotty and Colton but I'm torn between blowing up their mentions and not wanting to annoy them. What to do??
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-05 17:10:12	Got these for my birthday!! Might wear them to the concert tonight!! 😊😊👍 http://t.co/SkaVx0el
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-07 22:30:33	Not ready for break to be over!! Don't want to go back to class tomorrow! 😣 Can it be Thanksgiving break yet? Haha 😝
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-12 18:42:41	It's perfect weather to run and I can't because the doctor told me I need to rest my ankle so I have hold of on running for a bit... 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-13 03:58:57	Bed time. Full day of marching band tomorrow. Morning practice, football game, then performing at a High School marching competition.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-05 19:50:10	@ashleymccreery2 Have fun!! :) Are you in Columbus for the show tonight?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-05 19:55:28	@ScottyMcCreery I can't wait to see you tonight!! Couldn't ask for a better way to spend my birthday!!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-12 04:34:18	@coltondixon Ahhhhhh!!!! Yay!!! I'm so excited !! I can't wait to buy your album!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-05 23:17:00	Can't believe I'm seeing @ScottyMcCreery on my birthday!!! Concert is starting soon!!! 😃😃😃😃
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-06 03:19:39	@ScottyMcCreery Was flipping amazing!!! I only wish he could have had a longer set!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-06 03:31:27	@ScottyMcCreery I love you so much!! You did amazing tonight!! Seeing you live made this the best birthday ever!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-08 03:00:21	Break was way to short. But I enjoyed being at home for a few days!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-08 04:50:17	Can't sleep.. 😣 I already miss my own bed.... 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-08 04:57:16	Wishing I had a cuddle buddy right now.. #cantsleep
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-12 14:03:28	86 on my math test! So far today is off to a good start! 👍😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-12 16:06:03	Happy Birthday @jhutch1992!!! :D
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-15 00:35:50	I don't like studying for tests... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-15 12:55:50	Laying in bed because I'm to lazy to get up. But I need to get ready for class. Ugh... I hate Mondays.. 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-15 14:52:37	Test time. Not really ready for it... 😓
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-15 16:44:04	@Phillips Yay!!! I can't wait!!!!! :D
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-08 15:15:59	Can I go back to bed? 😔 #tired
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-13 15:36:34	Sleepy. 😔
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-16 04:14:09	@4skycolt @coltondixon It's really going to be on iTunes this week?? Wow! I'm behind on that news! Haha
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-16 04:16:16	I really hope my signed Christmas With Scotty McCreery CD comes tomorrow.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-13 20:22:20	And that's a Flyer victory!! Super proud of our boys! They played a great game today!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-16 14:19:16	I have a friend who I always love getting hugs from! He is just one of those people who gives really good tight hugs  that make you happy! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-16 15:57:20	In a really good mood today for no reason at all! 😊 I hope it stays that way!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-16 20:20:06	Coffee makes me more hyper/gives me more energy in the afternoon then it does in the morning.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-16 20:33:52	It came!! My Signed copy of Christmas With Scotty McCreey came today!!! 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃 http://t.co/fXeAHpY8
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-16 21:02:00	I love @ScottyMcCreery's Christmas CD!! Words can't describe how much I love it!! 😃
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-16 23:06:44	It's only October and all I want to listen to is Christmas With @ScottyMcCreery!! #SorryNotSorry 😁😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-17 01:08:55	That feeling when you feel like you've eaten to much junk food... &gt;.&lt;
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-17 01:12:54	After all that I've eaten today I want to go for a run. But I can't because it's dark and my freaking twisted ankle would probably swell 😠😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-13 23:02:11	Michigan-45. Illinois-0. It's been a great day for college football!! #GoBlue
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-13 23:15:52	That awkward moment when your ride forgets to pick you up. #Pissed 😡
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-13 23:23:07	And this is what happens when people assume things....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-17 14:46:19	I think that quiz actually went pretty well! *Knocks on wood* 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-17 14:51:31	All I want to do is go back to my apartment and listen to Christmas With @ScottyMcCreery! I don't care that it's October, it's an awesome CD
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-17 16:40:00	Well @ScottyMcCreery said to tell my friends to go buy Christmas With Scotty McCreery. So go do it!! Like right now!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-09 02:58:22	In one of those moods. 😔 It's only the first day back and I already feel like I have a ton of work to do. I'm ready for the next break. 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-09 04:01:13	@ladd_sarah15 That's what you get for selling your soul to Dr. Morris. Haha 😜
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-09 04:41:58	Happy Birthday Scotty McCreery!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-18 20:32:19	That moment when you realize @Phillips is in Ohio but you have no idea where... 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-18 22:01:16	Can I just say that the song Christmas In Heaven by @ScottyMcCreery is just so dagum beautiful!! ❤😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-14 16:16:43	I wish I could run today. But I really need to rest my ankle. This stinks... 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-14 16:19:21	Practice in less than an hour. But my bed feels so comfy I don't want to get up.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-09 12:33:28	@ScottyMcCreery Happy Birthday!!! I hope you have a great day!! Love you so much!! :) &lt;3
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 02:17:52	I've once agin eaten to much today. I really need to have better self control sometimes... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 02:50:46	I feel like running isn't enough of a workout. I need to start going to the gym. Gonna try and start going! Hope I can do it..
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-18 00:05:14	"There is the super Walmart where all the preppy people go. Than there's the GET OOOOOUT THE WAYYYYY Walmart." @KatieVanKeuren
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 03:09:43	Well this night just went down hill quickly.... 😢😠😡
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 04:47:09	I'm tired and all I want to do is either go to sleep to get my mind off the fact that I'm hungry or go work out (even though it's 1am). 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 04:49:38	Don't know why I've been stressed about working out/eating healthier... It's really starting to bother me. And I don't know what to do. 😔😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 05:05:15	😠😢😡😪😖😣😓😞😥😔 That basically sums up my emotions right now..
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 05:53:30	I think I've calmed down from my mini freak attack earlier. This is what happens when I'm stressed and I stay up to late.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 06:00:36	Happy Birthday @coltondixon!! 😃💙😄💙😄💙
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 11:00:16	Running on less than four hours of sleep. Today should be fun... 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 13:52:24	First class of the day was canceled!! 😁👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 14:33:19	The only down side to class being canceled is if I had known sooner I could have totally gone to the gym. Oh well.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 14:59:41	Less than four hours of sleep+coffee= a hyper me!! 😁😁😁😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-09 17:27:16	I got a 97 on my Social Work paper!! 😁👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-18 14:05:58	Why do I feel so tired this morning? 😔 Praise the lord for coffee! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-18 14:19:07	Why yes I am listening to Christmas With @ScottyMcCreery as I walk to class. And no I don't care that it's only
October. #IRegretNothing
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 15:37:21	@ladd_sarah15 Nope, you don't. You're an engineer major an Dr. Morris owns your soul so you have no life!! 😝
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 15:43:24	@ladd_sarah15 Okay. Maybe a small one! Haha :P But those two things don't give you much of a life outside of it.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 21:18:53	I'm so excited to see all the alumni band members this weekend!! Ahhhhh 😃
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-19 22:36:51	Guess who is getting an autographed copy of @Phillips CD? This click right here!! 😄😁😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-20 03:44:55	Before for I go to bed I want to wish @coltondixon a Happy Birthday one more time!! 😊💙🎉
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-22 12:56:08	Apparently I can put my hair in a ponytail when I'm asleep because when I went to bed it was down but when I woke up it was in a ponytail. 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-22 14:09:41	It's been a struggle bus morning... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-22 15:58:04	And what do I do when I have a bad morning? Listen to some @coltondixon!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-22 23:30:45	In this entire apartment of six people we have one pot to cook. Seriously?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-23 03:21:34	Two nights in a row where I'm in bed before midnight! 😱
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-23 13:08:45	@coltondixon Ahhhhh!!! This just made my morning!! :D

55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-24 01:34:37	I just got a pinterest. I can now say goodbye to the little bit of time that I used to have when I was not on twitter, tumblr, or Facebook.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-25 04:39:23	Bed time. 💤💤
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-25 06:02:08	Can't sleep... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-24 01:35:38	Oh and add instagram to the last part of my previous tweet. 😝
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-24 14:45:16	Is it just me or is this week going by really slow? 😔
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-24 17:32:35	I need to talk to someone about this but I don't know who.. 😞 #confused #upset
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-25 23:39:52	Seriously. If your laundry is done then take it out of the washing machine. There are other people who want to use it. 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-26 00:52:50	That moment when you're watching videos on YouTube and you see an add for Christmas With @ScottyMcCreery! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-24 22:01:22	And I missed @coltondixon's twitter party. I'm never going to get a tweet from him... 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-26 11:27:35	Up before 8 and at the recplex! #earlymorningworkout 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-26 11:52:33	Nothing like hearing @Phillips play at the gym in the middle of my workout!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-25 00:00:06	Gorgeous fall night at UD!! I love my school!! http://t.co/S2qsSwC5
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-25 01:59:51	Dinner with some awesome friends and a good work out has made this day so much better!! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-27 13:03:45	It's freaking cold outside and it's trying to rain.... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-28 14:13:29	@ChloesLetter Happy Birthday Chloe!!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-31 15:20:45	I hate sending an important email than waiting for the response from the person you sent it to.... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-31 16:03:50	Not that I particularly enjoy cold rainy weather but I hope this keeps up so practice can be moved inside. I would rather not freeze again.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-31 18:50:18	I want to move out of my apartment but I don't want to pack all my stuff. #lazy
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-31 22:56:59	I am sitting at my desk and I have not taken off a single layer yet because I'm still cold from being outside...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-31 22:57:30	Oh and I still have to go back out into the cold for exec board later... 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-01 14:33:06	You ask one simple thing and you get your head chewed off. Geez. Sorry I even asked. 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-21 00:52:49	Kansas State is on fire tonight!! #KSU
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-21 03:21:02	@gramofthehill @coltondixon You can preorder his album?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-28 19:59:38	@rwebb0714 no problem!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-21 17:54:48	Happy Birthday @SMagraneAI11!! 😊🎉
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-21 18:30:06	Pep band has already ruined plans. I love it but with many conflicts and the time it takes up I don't know how much of that I can handle 😣😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-21 18:48:30	Just kidding pep band hasn't caused any conflicts (yet). But it'll just be an extremely long weekend not next weekend but the weekend after.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-29 03:25:33	Already get the feeling that this may be a rough week. Pray that it's not. I don't think I can handle another bad week. 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-29 03:34:00	My roommate is blasting music at 11:30pm and I'm trying to go to sleep. Awesome.. Thank goodness I'm moving out by the end of the week.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-22 02:20:12	Can it be Friday yet?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-22 02:59:56	Really glad I went to the gym this morning but I'm pretty sure I'm going to feel it tomorrow. 😝
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-22 03:04:17	I don't even remember the last time I went to bed before midnight. #GoodnightTwitter
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-29 13:45:12	It's so cold outside.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-29 14:53:48	Started my morning of right with a nice workout. Even though it was tough getting up at 7am it was worth it! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-29 22:19:46	Days like today is when it sucks to play a metal instrument... Gotta love marching band in the freezing cold...  😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-30 04:09:02	So everyone needs to go download You Are by the amazing @coltondixon like right now!!! #justsayin
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-30 04:31:10	My RA wasn't in his room both times I went tonight so I wasn't able to talk to him about moving out. Ugh. Hopefully I'll be able to tomorrow
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-30 04:34:26	I really hope that everything works out in the next couple of days and I can move out and finally be living with friends by Friday.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-30 13:23:48	@sarahloud15 This is true. That should be fun! Haha 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-30 13:24:40	And it's snowing.... So much for some nice fall weather. It was nice while it lasted.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-30 15:56:34	It's cold and wet outside. Glad we don't have practice today. But I don't have high hopes that the weather will be different tomorrow.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-04 00:10:10	After being out in the freezing cold and getting rained on today I'm pretty sure I'm going to get sick. Gotta love marching band.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-30 19:16:10	So the conversation between @Phillips @CavanaghAI11 and @joshledet just made my day!! 😂
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-30 22:37:09	Telling my roommates tonight that I'm moving out. Really hope it goes over well. 😥
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-30 22:42:27	@Haliib Since I transferred I got put in an empty spot not knowing my roommates. And @sarahloud15 has an open bed so I decided to take it.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-30 22:47:40	@Haliib Yeah. I'm just worried because I have to take the TV that's in the living room. But they can deal with it. Lol
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-30 22:50:53	@Haliib There's actually 4. But yeah I think they could. And I hope to move out by Friday.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-10-30 23:02:44	@Haliib Probably a little. Lol. And I'm moving into Marianist.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-06 02:48:49	I feel like a terrible person because that made me happy! I do feel kind of bad though but that totally just made my day!!! Ahhhh!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-01 20:43:26	@sarahloud15 I hope she is a good roommate!! :P
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-01 22:10:20	I'm so excited for tomorrow! I'll officially be roommates with @sarahloud15!!! 😁

55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-14 04:12:20	I need to stop worrying/stressing about this. Needing some prayers to help get me though this and to stop stressing it please!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-14 04:19:07	Maybe some sleep will help. At least for a few hours it will get my mind off of things...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-14 05:47:22	@ScottyMcCreery I would guess it would be considered morning. I'm majoring in Criminal Justice so I'm sure I could find the answer for you 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-09 18:10:03	Day 9- I am thankful that I am a military brat and have been able to live in many different places in the US and even one foreign country.

55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-18 04:35:36	Tomorrow is going to be a long day. 😔 I'm excited for it and yet I'm not at the same time... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-18 04:36:49	Bed time. Gotta get up at like 4:30. At least I hope I can. Got five alarms set just in case! #GoodnightTwitter
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-18 10:57:37	To early to function... #Tired 😪😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-12 16:22:07	Since so many people got certain questions wrong my religion instructor added enough points that I now have a B on the test!! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-15 20:48:47	Less than one week until Thanksgiving break!! Going to be heading Arkansas to see my brother! 😃

55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-25 20:41:32	The welcoming signs into Tennessee should say something like "Welcome to Tennessee. Home State of Colton Dixon" #JustSaying @coltondixon
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-25 21:31:55	Not ready to go back to school. Can we just skip the next three weeks, automatically pass all finals, and just go to Christmas break?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-25 23:24:25	One thing I love about being
In the south is they play country music pretty much everywhere! 👍

55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-11-22 15:09:09	You know you're in the south when the free breakfast at the hotel has biscuits and gravy. 👍

55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-06 18:12:47	@Codie_ Geez. Haha. Still jealous that you are abler to get out of an exam. :P
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-07 18:22:28	I'm actually jealous of people taking exams this week. If Dayton had exams this week I would have gone home yesterday.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-04 01:31:29	Watch another episode of Glee on Hulu or do something productive like study do finals? Another episode of Glee it is!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-04 04:58:05	Talking about it helped. It's going to take time to not worry/stress at all. Wish I hadn't gotten myself into this mess in the first place.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-07 00:08:39	Excellent workout today!! #ohyes 😊👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-07 01:06:28	Just saw a clip of the one girl who sang A Man's World on X-Factor. It was good but I would much rather hear @joshledet sing it any day!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-07 22:49:22	There are rain deer on campus for Christmas on Campus!! I really want to go pet one!!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-08 01:39:50	It's 8:30 and I feel exhausted. 😔 I haven't even done anything to make me feel this tired. Should probably go to bed early.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-04 05:05:57	I am ready for break. To be done with the semester and hopefully away from this stress.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-04 18:57:29	I get excited thinking about Christmas break. Than I remember there are still two days of classes and that I have five finals next week. 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-04 18:29:42	@ScottyMcCreery LOVED IT!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-08 04:21:39	I suddenly feel wide awake now. 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-07 02:14:21	Glee!! 😁😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-07 18:20:58	I still need to do Christmas shopping. Haven't done any. Guess I know what I'm doing when I go home for break. 😜
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-06 01:07:05	I would have an instructor that has a test the last day of classes as well as a final next week... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-09 05:01:13	Tired of having this feeling. I'm getting better but sometimes I just can't get it off my mind. Really hoping I can just stop all together.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-09 05:13:29	I know deep down it's not true but my brain keeps telling me other wise. I want to be rid of these negative thoughts once and for all... 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-09 05:33:36	With some strength, encouragement, and a few small life style changes I will get rid of these thoughts one way or another!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-09 17:20:43	Sleeping in after a long busy day feels amazing! Plus sleep helps clear my mind.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-08 17:03:22	Long day of pep band today. Gotta double header today. Women's games this afternoon and Men's game tonight. #GoDaytonFlyers
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-09 22:18:33	Have actually gotten some studying done this afternoon!! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-06 18:17:07	Done with classes for the semester!! 😁 Now if only I was done with finals....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-09 23:44:28	A lot of my pictures have disappeared. And it's all the ones from instagram. Are you no longer able to post pictures on here from instagram?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 03:05:36	"Deb you have such a pretty face. You should be on a Christmas card." #elf
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-13 18:03:57	Just one more exam left!!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-13 19:16:19	Last exam in fifteen minutes. #leggo
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-13 20:37:45	Officially done with this semester!!! 😃😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-13 20:40:36	@jjewelblujay I think I did well on them! Good luck on the rest of yours! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-13 20:43:54	@jjewelblujay Thanks! :) And that's good! I won't know for a little while how I did. Not until grades are posted.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-13 20:49:45	@jjewelblujay yup. Hopefully it won't take to long to get posted.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-07 17:14:50	Yay for no classes today and being able to sleep in!! Christmas on Campus later today!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-11 20:50:52	Two exams down. Three to go! Break is so close I can taste it! Two of my harder exams tomorrow so I gotta get to studying. #blah
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-08 17:32:52	Women's team is playing Michigan State today. I have double the reason to boo them. Being a Flyer fan and a Michigan fan.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 17:39:00	It's exam week! #bringiton #leggo
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 19:11:45	Sociology exam in twenty minutes. 😳 Hoping I pass...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-14 01:28:42	The first thing I did when I got home was look under the tree to see what presents were mine. My inner child couldn't resist! 😝😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-14 02:28:06	Nothing else matters because I'm done with this semester and I'm officially on Christmas break!!!! 🎅🎄
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-11 22:12:11	Two commercials in less than an hour that had @Phillips' song Home playing in it! :D
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 21:08:19	One exam down! Four more to go!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 21:53:12	@CavanaghAI11 Yuck! I don't like the dentist either.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-08 23:32:15	Game number two. So tired. 😞Don't really want to go. Oh well. Hoping for a win!!! #GoDaytonFlyers
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-09 03:50:58	Two victories in one day! Women beat Michigan State and Men beat Miami! It's a great day to be a Flyer! http://t.co/uE7Vadpb
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-14 16:41:10	It sickness me to read about the shooting at the elementary school in CT. I just don't understand how someone can shoot innocent people.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 02:14:54	Watching Elf! Don't even care that it's the second time I've watched it this weekend!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 02:27:34	"You did it! Congratulations, worlds best cup of coffee. Good job everyone. It was great meeting you!" #elf
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 02:32:16	"What's a Christmas gram? I want one!" #elf
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 02:36:05	"SANTA! Oh my god! Santa here? I know him! I know him!" #elf
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 02:41:23	"Dad!? Hi! It's me buddy! Dad! Dad! DAD!" #elf
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 02:44:46	"You sit on a throne of lies" #elf
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 02:48:53	"I thought we could make a ginger bread house. Eat cookie dough. Go ice skating and maybe even hold hands." #elf
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 02:52:15	"We elves try to stick to the four main food groups. Candy. Candy corn. Candy-canes. And syrup." #elf
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 03:00:21	"Ow! Son of a nutcracker!" #elf
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 03:06:48	"Buddy the elf. What's your favorite color?" #elf
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 03:16:50	"He's an angry elf." #elf
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 03:18:47	"I'm sorry I ruined your lives and crammed elven cookies into the VCR." #elf
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-14 18:58:13	@Codie_ Haha. I would still have one left but I was able to take it early. :P
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-14 19:28:16	@Codie_ That's weird. Lol. But I have pep band camp tonight and tomorrow so I'm not completely on break just yet.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-12 04:18:35	Ugh.. I hate stress eating because I keep eating and yet still feel hungry and self control is out the window when I'm stressed. 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-12 04:30:09	I hate having things on my mind. But I don't know who to talk to it about that would understand and who could help me.. 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-12 04:35:08	I wish I didn't care about this so much. Life would be a lot easier if I didn't care so much. How did I get my self into this mess?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-12 04:48:39	Wondering if I should still be studying. But I'm tried and if I don't know it now I won't before 8am tomorrow... So I guess that is a no.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-12 05:21:22	I'll be home in less than 48 hours. Maybe than I can work on not being stressed about this because I know parents will help me get over it.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-12 05:45:51	Took some meds to help me sleep and I think they're kicking in. #GoodnightTwitter
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-10 05:17:57	Time for bed. Gotta get up in the morning and do a bit of studying before my first final.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-11 04:45:18	Free coffee and doughnuts tonight! 😜
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-11 04:46:07	@gramofthehill If I can go I totally would wear red!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-12 12:40:57	8am math exam. #bringiton
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-12 12:41:16	Blah. To early to be up. Need some coffee.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-12 14:33:23	Feeling pretty confident that I did good on my math final!! And now I am done with math FOREVER!! 😁 Just two more exams left!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-15 00:04:49	Nice day of relaxing. But now to start pep band camp part 1! #leggo
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-15 03:35:59	It's breaking my heart to watch the news about what happened in CT today. My thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-11 07:36:44	I can't fall asleep. For the second night in a row... 😞😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-12 16:45:15	@ScottyMcCreery Don't you just love studying for finals? Haha ;P
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-12 17:12:02	@ErikaVanPelt Happy Birthday!!! I hope you have a wonderful day!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-15 05:59:48	@coltondixon Just thought I would drop by and say that's you're amazing and that I love you! I'm super excited for your album! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-12 20:19:44	Just one more exam tomorrow and I will be done!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😁

55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-15 16:04:13	Pep band camp part 1 day two! #leggo
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-12 21:59:43	I think it's time for a nap!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-15 20:15:02	Sitting in the car and Home comes on the radio. I try to fangirl about @Phillips with my friend but I for get she isn't as big of a fan.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-12 23:06:10	Short power naps are the best! They give you enough energy to finish the rest of the day.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-12 23:07:31	In less than twenty four hours I will be done with this semester an I will be at home relaxing! #Excited 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-13 01:16:49	What's up with tumblr today? It's been down all afternoon.. 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-13 01:27:48	Before I go workout I usually feel lazy and have to force myself to go do it. But then I feel amazing after words! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-15 21:38:06	It's so cold in this building.... 👎
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-15 23:50:06	My chops are really worn out and the game hasn't even started yet.... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-15 23:56:34	I love the intro for the UD Men's and Women's basketball games! Gives me chills every time!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-13 03:12:48	Think I ate a little to much fruit earlier. Not that it's bad to have a lot of fruit. Just not a good idea to have that much at once. #blah
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-16 01:34:59	@KatieVanKeuren has gone gangster....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-16 01:49:55	The guy next to me has been really obnoxious the whole game... #annoyed 😡
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-16 02:09:33	Another Flyer victory!!! #GoDaytonFlyers http://t.co/CTO4RRWd
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-16 05:42:51	Girl talk with my mom always makes everything better!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-16 20:38:01	Going to see Breaking Dawn part 2... Finally! 😁😜
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-16 23:20:48	That moment while watching Breaking Dawn Part 2 when... THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN THE BOOK!! 😱
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-16 17:04:42	I am the way God made me and I need to learn to fully accept that and not let society influence that.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-16 17:09:53	Society is so wrong when telling girls how thin they need to be or the clothes they have to wear, etc. Everyone is different! Remember that!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-17 22:58:45	Got all my Christmas shipping done! 👍 Except for stuff for my mom for Christmas/ her birthday but I'm going with my dad to do that later.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-17 19:48:32	Time to get a little Christmas shopping done. And by a little a little I mean all of it. 😜🎄
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-18 15:14:47	Is Christmas really only a week away? This year went by really fast... 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-18 15:33:49	@coltondixon would tweet about winning tickets to a show in Columbus when I'm not at home and cant't get a picture of me in holiday sprit. 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-19 20:00:08	Just found out my brother won't be able to come for Christmas... :(
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-19 21:04:08	It's freezing in my house... 😖👎
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-20 22:45:34	When ever I feel like I'm making progress the negative thoughts always come back... :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-20 23:06:38	My brain needs to shut up. I know deep down that these thoughts aren't true. If my brain would shut up I would truly believe it. #stressed
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-21 02:26:30	SCOTTY!!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-21 15:09:00	Snow!!! It's about time! 😁😜 http://t.co/V033hB02

55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-19 02:40:40	It's 9:30 and I'm tired. I'm getting old...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-19 14:51:00	So excited to go to my first Dayton basketball game tonight where I don't have to play with the pep band!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-21 22:35:48	The worst battles are in your one mind. Trying to beat the negative thoughts. Sometimes they win but if I keep fighting I will defeat them!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-22 04:35:23	But at least I'm not stressing over a guy. 😝 That might actually be worse than this. Haha
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-22 15:48:06	I hate how I can to sleep stressed. But I love how I can wake up and not worry about it. Hoping I wont stress about it today!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-22 16:09:25	Time for some flyer basketball!!! 🏀 #GoDaytonFlyers
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-19 17:27:40	Forgetting you have an appointment and being reminded about it forty five minutes before it starts.....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-20 00:09:58	Every time I see people talking during the National Anthem I want to smack them. It so disrespectful. 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-22 23:04:41	@ScottyMcCreery If you do transfer from NC State what school would you go to?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-21 00:04:47	My thoughts change so quickly. I wish they would stay positive like they are now. I need to stop letting society influence me.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-22 17:04:41	Don't know what happened this semester. Didn't do very well. I think I may have screwed up my chances of doing what I wanted this semester 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-22 17:18:40	Thinking about all that I have this semester waiting until next might actually be better. Otherwise my grades may slip again.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-22 17:19:21	And it isn't the end of the world if I have to wait. As long as I can do it that's all that matters!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-22 23:03:31	@ScottyMcCreery Favorite part of the Holidays??

55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-23 04:33:25	And here comes the late night stress and worry.. :(
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-22 04:37:03	Tired now. Off to bed. Sleep usually helps me de-stress. Hoping that I won't worry so much tomorrow.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-23 19:55:25	Every time I look at both of my tweets from @ScottyMcCreery I smile like an idiot. But I can't help it because it makes me happy! 😊

55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-23 15:49:44	One year ago today was the day we had to put my dog down. Hard to believe it's been a year without her already...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-23 15:56:04	The Christmas ornament I got this year! I wonder if @coltondixon would like it! Haha 😏😁 #batman http://t.co/sx0vZx7E
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-22 00:38:42	So glad that my brother and his fiancé will be here later tonight! 😊 Just wish my other brother could join us as well. 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-22 03:45:59	I wish I had never gotten my self into this. I always feel like I over eat when I know I don't. And I exercise.. What is my problem?... :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-22 04:34:32	I go one day where I don't worry about it to the next where I do. I need to not think about it anymore. It's a stupid thing to stress about.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-24 01:35:35	Music is so powerful! Huge thanks to @Phillips for singing this song because it has helped me out so much lately! http://t.co/6wmE4KLO

55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-24 21:41:58	The snow here would come tomorrow night/ Wednesday morning when I'm flying out of Dayton. 😠😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-25 03:19:31	@ScottyMcCreery And we love you too Scotty!!! 😊☺

55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-25 17:43:20	@ScottyMcCreery Merry Christmas Scotty!! I hope you have a great day!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-25 20:12:38	Realizing that I haven't packed at all and I leave for Texas in like 15 hours. Haha
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-25 20:19:59	So much good food! I'm so full now!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-25 20:54:43	Heavy snow is supposed to start coming in late tonight. Praying that it doesn't effect my flight tomorrow morning.. 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-25 21:44:47	My brother and his fiancé had to leave early because of the possible bad weather coming in.. :/ Hope they have a safe trip back.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-25 21:57:46	Got @adamlambert's album Trespassing for Christmas!! 😁👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-26 16:10:31	I hate this stupid snow. I can leave for Texas now until Friday. I would almost be there if this stupid storm hadn't come in. 😢😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-26 18:18:46	Going to try and make today a good day. But that's going to be difficult because all I can think about is how I could be in Texas now. 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-26 18:33:59	Gee thanks for making me feel guilty.. You just made my mood worse. Can I go back to bed and just not face the world today?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-27 23:14:23	Really? You're seriously getting mad because you don't agree with what the directions say... Like really...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-27 23:21:20	Calm down. Like seriously. You have no reason to get mad over this....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-27 23:42:57	I try to get my input in a everyone just gets even more angry. Guess I'll just shut up now. 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-28 10:34:09	Blah.. I hate flying. I have flown so many times it isn't even funny and yet I still get scared every time... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-28 11:46:42	Wheels up! ✈
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-28 20:33:06	In the car with my BFFs dad about to call my other best fiends boyfriend when You Are by @coltondixon came on the radio. I almost screamed.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-25 23:32:27	I hate that the snow is supposed to come tomorrow. Possibly messing up my travel plans and once I do leave I won't be able to enjoy it. 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-26 01:32:13	Please please please let all the snow come AFTER I fly out. I really don't want to be delayed..
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-26 03:58:38	I was having a good day until my flight out of Dayton was canceled. 😢 Hoping I can get a knew one...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-26 21:59:35	In a little bit better mood. But still bummed that I'm not in Texas yet.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-26 23:00:01	I get annoyed when I have one simple request and people still don't do what I ask... 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-29 00:51:18	@ScottyMcCreery I'm good Scotty! How are you? :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-27 01:12:31	I hate those moods where your somewhat in a good mood but at the same time you're not... :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-27 02:01:20	It's freezing in my house....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-27 02:22:42	#ScottyRockedOur2012 We love you @ScottyMcCreery!!!! 😊💙
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-27 03:01:35	Elf is on!!! Day has been made! I seriously can watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-29 21:27:52	"Don't pay no mind to the demons they fill you with fear."
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-29 23:09:45	My mom just texted to tell me my @ScottyMcCreery blanket came!! 😃 To bad I'm in Texas and the blanket is back in Ohio.. 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-30 00:35:49	Reading the paper. Drinking coffee. And listening to @Phillips. I feel like such an adult but it's quit relaxing. 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-27 03:45:47	Going to finish watching Elf than go to bed. Gotta get plenty of sleep tonight since I won't get a whole lot tomorrow night.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-30 06:18:17	@ScottyMcCreery Good night Scotty!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-30 06:39:29	@ScottyMcCreery Love it!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-30 07:20:45	@TimUrbanMusic Good night Tim!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-30 14:17:47	Not even 8:30 and I'm already up and have taken a shower! I really must be getting old since it's not as difficult getting up early anymore.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-27 18:41:06	@SchylerDixon Morning Schyler! Hope you have a wonderful day!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-31 22:23:08	I like food but I don't want to get fat. Oh well, it's the last day of the year. Might as well not care about it today. 😜
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-30 20:23:17	Blah.. I feel like I ate to much bread.. Now I want to go work it off at the gym... :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-30 20:26:29	One thing I hate about traveling is not being able to workout. Gonna have to drag my friends to the gym when we get back to San Antonio.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-30 22:57:22	@MikeMGarner Wohoo!! Got Pats!!! That's my team!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-01 02:04:15	And self control is out the window tonight. I have eaten so much.... 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-31 02:26:20	Seriously feeling forever alone right now.... 😞😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-31 02:44:56	Feeling sleepy but I can't lay down because my part of the bed is being currently occupied.... 😣

55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-28 09:24:48	To early to be up. I hate early morning flights... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-01 06:22:07	I ate waaaaaaay to much tonight. 😣 But there was so much good food.... Need to go to the gym ASAP!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-28 15:18:42	What up Dallas!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-28 15:56:34	When I'm in an airport I'm on mission to get to where I need to be. So either walk faster or get out of my way. #IHateSlowWalkers
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-28 16:37:35	Airplanes were not built for tall people. #TallPeopleProblems
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-28 18:19:47	And I made it to San Antonio! Two days later than expected though.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-01 18:37:31	Come on Michigan! Get your game together!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-01 18:44:36	Back hurts from sleeping on a futon last night.... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-01 18:51:10	Finaly!! #GoBlue
55453630	AprilKathleen	2012-12-31 16:34:19	Heading back to San Antonio today! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-01 21:45:10	😢 Well at least Michigan put up a fight.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-01 21:46:57	@Haliib You're just now finding out I'm a Michigan fan? Hahaha :P
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-01 22:32:37	I love it when @air1radio plays @coltondixon!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-02 02:39:02	I have eaten so much I the last two days. Why is there so much good food this time of year? I feel so fat right now.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-02 02:41:47	Note to self: Don't over stuff myself the next few days. I think I ate like three days worth of food in the last two days. #NotCool
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-02 04:09:58	Must not think about all the calories I have eaten the last two days. Just have to not do it again! And just work my butt off at the gym.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-03 23:19:37	Had coffee. Now I have more energy!! 👍☕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-04 05:15:25	Watching Mean Girls! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-04 06:40:03	"She doesn't even go here!" #meangirls
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-02 16:26:52	Can't start my day without coffee!! ☕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-02 16:39:57	Haven't been to the gym in almost a week. 😳 Gotta get back to it! Hopefully my friends are still willing to go!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-04 18:30:42	I've said it before and I'll it agin: I can't start my day off right without some coffee!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-04 18:45:59	I'm so sad that Kansas State lost yesterday... 😔 They only lost two games. So close to an undefeated season.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-03 00:13:17	Le Miserables was incredible!!! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-03 05:37:28	@ScottyMcCreery Yay! I'm glad you feel better!!!! 😃
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-06 00:43:31	Gotta love San Antonio traffic.... NOT!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-07 19:18:19	I think I might be catching a cold. 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-07 20:02:48	Wheels up! ✈
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-06 17:48:19	Nothing better then sweet tea!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-10 22:52:59	Every time I cough I feel like someone is taking a razor to my throat...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-11 01:20:18	I can already tell I'm starting to lose my voice.  And with a basketball game this weekend it's just going to make it worse.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-11 03:00:45	@Haliib True. But games are no fun if you already have no voice. Lol
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-12 00:33:27	@TimUrbanMusic Yes! Love the idea!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-12 03:31:28	Not ready for this to be the last weekend before classes start. It even sucks more that I'm sick... 😣

55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-12 19:01:52	You haven't experienced anything until you've been to a Flyer basketball game! There is no other college basketball atmosphere like it!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-11 14:18:58	Feeling worse today... 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-11 14:32:41	Great... I woke up with a slight fever....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-11 15:05:29	@flymbal12 Thanks!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-11 15:07:42	Watching Home and Family on the Hallmark channel just because @coltondixon is on it! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-11 16:03:43	Yay!!! @coltondixon is about to perform!!! 😃😃😃😃
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-11 16:08:49	Not feeling so good today but seeing @coltondixon and @WJaredMartin on my TV puts a smile on my face and makes me feel better!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-11 16:52:42	Getting to see @coltondixon perform twice this morning was amazing!! He never fails to put a smile on my face!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-13 00:26:44	Not ready to go back to school just yet. I've loved being home. But then again I'll be home next weekend since my brother is coming home. 😝
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-13 00:27:56	@KenziLewis @schylerdixon Awwww!! Love it!! You both are so pretty!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-08 15:04:20	Sick the last week of break. Fantastic... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-08 15:49:18	I was just offered the chance to be trip chair again for my marching band!! 😊I'm glad they think I did a good enough job to do it again!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-13 02:30:45	My brother is coming home at the end of the week! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-08 22:20:31	Opsss.... 😓 So much for that.. :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-09 00:18:00	I will not let today set me back! When trying to reach a goal here will be good days and bad, but eventually you will get there! And I will!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-11 20:31:53	18 days until #amessenger!!!  @coltondixon
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-11 20:32:50	Yay for new phone cover!! #batman http://t.co/bhWkvXDf
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-06 21:53:09	Last day in Texas. 😔 But I am excited to be heading home! Just wish my visit could have been longer.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-09 03:27:08	Blah. I hate being sick. It makes me feel tired all day. Probably going to go to bed soon.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-09 03:28:19	My goal for tomorrow is to not let what I did today bother me and to continue to work towards my goal! I hope it ends up being a good day!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-13 21:51:56	Dang rain. I wanted to go for a walk today since I didn't got the the gym. I would have gone sooner but the meds I took made me sleepy.. :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-13 23:35:59	I don't want to go back to school yet. 😢 I want to stay at home and be on break longer. The only good thing will be seeing friends.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-09 14:58:10	@SchylerDixon Happy Birthday!! I hope you have a fantastic day!! 😊🎉🎈
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-07 03:32:16	I feel like a ate a lot today but I really didn't. But I do feel like I ate more than I should have a few times on this trip...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-07 03:36:11	Back to my usual workout routine when I get back home. Once I get back to it maybe I won't feel bad about all the stuff I've eaten lately.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-07 03:44:06	I have realized that traveling isn't the best idea when you're trying to get into healthy eating habits. Oh well. I had fun in Texas!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-14 02:48:37	I took a nice hot shower. Had an apple for a quick snack and now I feel a bit better. 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-12 17:27:48	Tip off in an hour and a half! Goooooo Dayton Flyers!! #BeatButler
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-09 16:22:45	Guess what come out in 20 days? @coltondixon's #amessenger!!! Are you as excited as I am? I suggest you go pick up a copy when it comes out!

55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-14 04:23:33	Bed time. Yay for meds that make you sleepy! Haha #GoodnightTwitter
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-14 16:11:40	Being sick on the first day of class just make is that much worse.. 😣 Is it the weekend yet?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-13 16:18:06	Classes haven't even started yet and I'm already counting down the weeks until summer! 16 weeks!! Haha 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-13 16:27:48	I feel better for the most part but my head is stuffed up today and it's making me feel drained...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-09 20:23:14	I hate being sick. I feel so drained today.. 😪
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-09 21:29:24	@coltondixon @markschultz Me too!! Love that song!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-09 21:49:08	It's going to cost me $414.25 for text books this semester. 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-14 16:47:00	Off to my second class.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-07 17:41:10	@coltondixon I am!!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-07 18:16:13	Peace out San Antonio! Until next time.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-07 19:00:07	@SchylerDixon Awww. 😨 I hope you feel better!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-07 22:13:43	Back in Dayton!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-13 17:08:41	"Don't pay no mind to the demons they fill you with fear."
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-13 18:32:44	Not ready to go back to school. Plus I'm worried being at school will make my goals of working on self control/cutting back sugar harder. 😓
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-13 18:38:34	Dang you sugary food and tasting so good and making me want to eat you. Stop being so good so I can cut back on my sugar intake!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-09 23:11:39	Happy Birthday @SchylerDixon!!! Hope you had a fantastic day!! 😊❤🎉🎁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-15 15:55:01	Hoping that today goes better then yesterday!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-15 15:56:27	2 weeks until #amessenger!! And you can pre order it now on iTunes!! :D @coltondixon
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-10 02:39:44	@coltondixon  @anniecog Cuties!!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-10 03:15:15	Looks like it's going to another early night for me. Not feeling so good.. :/ This cold is kicking my butt.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-10 03:39:45	Today was much better than yesterday! More days like this and I know reaching my goal will be so much easier! 😃
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-10 03:57:11	One last Happy Birthday wish to @SchylerDixon!! Hope it was a great day!! 😃🎉
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-15 15:58:39	Go preorder @coltondixon's album #amessenger!! Seriously go do it NOW!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-15 16:21:20	Just listened to the preview of #amessenger and I LOVED it!! I am so proud of @coltondixon!!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-15 16:22:50	Can't wait until Friday! My brother is coming home! Now I just need to make it through the rest of the week until then....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-15 16:24:47	I've had my coffee and now I'm ready to take on the rest if the day! 👍☕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-14 16:10:48	I already miss getting up and not having to worry about going to class. Blah...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-14 20:53:19	Concert band in less than an hour! The only class I've been excited about! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-14 21:05:07	I am so over this cold. I wish I could be at home, curled up on the couch watching TV, and not have to worry about class.. 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-14 22:43:32	I keep going back a forth between feeling better to feel bad to feeling better again. This is not how I want to feel the first week...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-14 22:59:18	@ColtonLoveDixon Thanks! You too! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-15 02:03:32	Today was just ehh.. It went by really slow. 😔 I really just want it to be the weekend already.. 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-15 02:10:53	Even though today was just okay on the up side I do feel like I did a good job with working towards my goals. :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-10 17:45:56	19 days until #amessenger!!!! @coltondixon
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-10 18:16:33	Second half of pep band camp starts today. 👎 Going to try and make it through it even though I feel like death.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-08 00:17:51	I just ate a lot. But then agin I have eaten next to nothing today.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-08 01:38:13	Must. Stop. Eating. But my body needs the energy. This is why I hate traveling... I end stuffing myself when I finally can finally eat.. :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-08 02:09:28	Bed time soon. Sleeping helps clear my mind. I can start fresh tomorrow. Now that I'm home I feel like I can properly start my resolutions.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-08 02:59:42	Not feeling so well. Some I'm going to cover up with my @ScottyMcCreery blanket, drink my tea, then head to bed early.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-08 03:11:12	#HaylorBreakUpSongTitles Want to listen to one? @TimUrbanMusic wrote one! Go check it out on YouTube! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-15 20:17:11	I want to take a nap. But I have class in about an hour. Blah...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-15 23:27:28	Welp... Idol starts tomorrow. I am excited but at the same time it'll take a lot to top seasons 10 and 11. If that's even possible. 😜
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-16 03:27:13	Today went by a little faster. But I get the feeling that tomorrow will be a long day... 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-16 03:29:58	Icy Hot is my best friend right now! My back has been killing me all evening.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-16 16:20:53	Feeling pretty blah today....😔
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-16 17:11:48	Ate a late breakfast and now I feel a lot better' 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-16 19:44:47	I am ridding the struggle bus today... 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-18 00:52:34	Idol in ten minutes!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-20 19:13:43	Good thing I'm working on cutting back sugar and not calories now. Bar food isn't really on the lower calorie side. But  it's so good! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-20 19:21:44	And it's snowing.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-17 02:57:27	An awesome win tonight by the women's basketball team!! Go Flyers! http://t.co/rntisHe4
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-17 04:16:37	If that really was @SchylerDixon in that clip tonight (and I'm pretty sure it was) then I already know who my favorite is!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-20 21:03:41	A cappuccino from Starbucks was just the energy kick I needed! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-20 21:49:45	Come on! We're so close to getting him in the lead!! Vote vote vote for @ScottyMcCreery!! http://t.co/Wc9cvjVE
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-20 23:54:37	Nice weekend in Michigan with my brother and his fiancé! Now back to Ohio. But no classes tomorrow!! Yay!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-21 00:24:41	He's in the lead!! Come on McCreerians!! We need to keep @ScottyMcCreery in the lead!! VOTE!! http://t.co/Wc9cvjVE
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-21 00:50:29	I knew if I posted something on Facebook supporting the Patriots I would catch some crap. Oh well. I have the right to support my team! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-21 00:52:23	TOUCHDOWN PATRIOTS!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-21 00:55:26	If the @patriots win tonight and if @ScottyMcCreery wins the next round of the taste of country bowl I will be very happy!! 😃
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-21 02:15:32	Let's keep @ScottyMcCreery in the lead! We can do it McCreerians!! Vote!!! http://t.co/Wc9cvjVE

55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-17 16:11:48	I enjoy not having class until noon on Tuesday and Thursday!! 😁👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-17 16:22:02	So glad it's Thursday! Just have to make it through today and part of tomorrow then I get to go home and my brother will be home tomorrow!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-17 16:24:02	Get to @SchylerDixon audition on Idol tonight! I'm so happy she tired out again! 😊 She was very sneaky not telling her fans about it! 😜
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-21 03:52:24	I hate when you travel and when you get home all you want to do us eat...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-21 03:54:13	Gotta get back on track tomorrow!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-17 16:59:39	Time for class. But since I only have two classes today I'm not going to complain. 😜
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-17 19:44:34	Hitting up the gym between classes! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-21 04:41:49	Looks like I'm going have to eat way less sugar this week to make up for my splurge tonight....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-18 01:08:25	Please show @SchylerDixon's audition before I have to go my meeting at 9!! Please!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-18 01:31:19	Come on! I want to see @SchylerDixon!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-18 03:00:12	Even though they didn't show her audition I already have my favorite. And her name is @SchylerDixon!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-08 22:34:23	I guess I need to dig deeper to find the strength. I know I have it. I just need to find it. And once I do I'll finally be happy with myself
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-09 00:13:43	As always girl talk with my mom makes me feel better!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-18 04:56:40	I'm trying to sleep but @ScottyMcCreery keeps tweeting and it's making my phone go off!! Haha 😜
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-18 05:07:13	If @ScottyMcCreery's fist headlining tour does not come to Ohio I will cry. Hoping that they will announce at least one stop in Ohio!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-18 14:39:38	Workout this morning kicked my butt. I guess since I'm still sick getting up and working out first thing in the morning isn't a good idea. 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-18 14:41:47	My brother will be home today! Then headed to Michigan tomorrow to see my other brother and his fiancé! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-18 15:05:38	I seriously feel like I'm going to die... 😣

55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-22 03:25:18	@ScottyMcCreery How excited are you to be going on your fist headlining tour??😃
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-22 03:59:00	I don't want to go back to classes tomorrow.. 😔
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-22 16:58:23	Is it Friday yet?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-22 20:58:22	Today has been okay so far. I wish it was over though. I'm tired and I don't feel like doing anything else.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-22 22:03:32	Why am I so tired? I wish the day was over so I could go to bed... 😔
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-22 22:05:41	On the upside I just got out of class forty minutes early!! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-22 22:39:34	Okay McCreerians let's vote for Scotty!! We have to get him to win again!! @ScottyMcCreery http://t.co/UFe78bxw
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-18 17:00:07	I am so over this week. And I am so over this cold. This has been the worst first week of classes ever....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-18 17:49:50	Just one more class and I'm done!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-18 18:00:35	My back is killing me. It hurst to the point where it's difficult to walk.. 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-19 00:54:37	Defiantly going to bed early tonight. It's only 8 and I already feel like I could sleep for the rest of the night.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-24 21:27:40	Had an excellent workout this afternoon! I feel amazing now! 👍😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-19 04:40:00	My own bed!! So much more comfortable then the bed in my dorm!! #GoodnightTwitter 💤💤
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-23 16:34:34	It's so cold. I don't want to go back outside to walk to class.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-23 16:56:42	Guess who has tickets to see @Phillips on May 16? This girl right here!!! #excited 😃😄😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-23 17:04:23	@jenn_wendling @phillips Clark State University in Springfield, OH.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-22 15:36:36	Don't want to go back to class today.. But I just need to make it to Friday then I'll be home again for the weekend!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-25 14:59:58	Yay for walking to class while it's snowing....... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-25 17:00:36	"Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done." Philippians 4:6
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-25 17:05:03	People it's just snow. Unless you drive you have no excuse to not be in class. Suck it up and walk in it like the rest of us.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-24 00:22:01	The men are on fire tonight! #GoDaytonFlyers
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-25 23:47:15	The tickets to see @Phillips came in the mail today!!!! I can't wait!!! 😃 #Excited http://t.co/pZw80YL8
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-24 01:21:24	Seriously you're in college. GROW UP and stop acting like an [insert bad word here]! 😡
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-26 03:08:29	A nice cup of tea before bed! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-24 02:59:47	And the men's basketball team wins tonight!! #GoDaytonFlyers http://t.co/3A1CUhE5
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-19 21:24:32	Freezing... 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-24 16:05:57	Can't watch Idol tonight because I have a meeting. Boo! 👎
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-24 16:59:54	Today is going to be a good day! I can feel it! And I am determined to make it happen!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-26 18:10:43	I think I may have lost a few pounds. Its not much but if it's a result of cutting back sugar then it's just more motivation to keep going!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-20 01:12:51	Just had Indian food for the first time. It was sooooo good! But now I'm really full. 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-26 20:28:06	I have a headache and if I play anything above the staff on my piccolo it feels like my head is going explode. 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-20 03:42:50	Seriously? What did I do? #annoyed #pissed 😡😡
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-26 23:36:31	And the men's basketball team wins again!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-27 02:00:11	I just ate so much. Good thing I hadn't eaten much else today.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-27 02:38:13	Why would you post pictures on Facebook of you consuming alcohol if you're not 21?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-27 03:02:58	Busy weekend of pep band! Men's game today and women's game tomorrow.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-27 03:03:08	The men won today! Up next the women vs. UMASS tomorrow. Go Flyers!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-27 03:48:39	I've preordered #amessenger by @coltondixon. Have you? If not then I highly suggest you go do it right now!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-27 03:50:09	It still feels like my stomach is going to explode. 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-27 05:21:35	Bed time. Gotta get up tomorrow to support our lady flyers! #GoodnightTwitter 💤💤
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-27 16:34:38	It's game day! Let's go lady flyers!! #GoDaytonFlyers
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-29 21:34:46	That moment when you realize you forgot to study for the quiz in your next class. Oops.... 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 00:54:21	I wish I could have worked out today.. :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 01:06:09	I feel like sick now. I can't believe how much I just ate. I hate my self when I do this. I really need to work harder on self control.  😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 01:26:05	All I want to do is workout right now. That's been the best stress reliever for me lately. But I can't until tomorrow....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 02:40:11	Since I can't work out right now sleep will be the next best stress reliever. And then it's off to the gym first thing in the
morning!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 04:35:23	A little late posting this but another fanatic game by the lady flyers today! Both men and women won this weekend! It's great to be a flyer!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 04:42:35	"Don't pay no mind to the demons they fill you with fear."
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 05:03:33	Sleep time. Sleep helps me get rid of stress. Starting fresh tomorrow and changing the way I approach certain things.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 05:06:27	"If at first you don't succeed try try again." Realizing that my first approach didn't work and now I'm going to try a different way!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-30 16:29:07	Good luck to the UD Men's Basketball team as they take on Xavier tonight!! #BeatX
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 15:20:57	Starting fresh today and changing the way I'm approaching things. Sometimes we need to try more then on way before we find the solution.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 15:22:01	“@coltondixon: Tomorrow.  You're only a day away.” I'm so excited!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 16:55:31	One of the hardest things to do is to not let what happened yesterday bother you today. That is on major thing I need to work on.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 18:41:43	Why does this class drag on?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 19:25:57	I hate how I have to be stuck at school for most of the time while my brother is home. But weekends are better then nothing.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 19:43:02	Today is just a meh kind of day. :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 20:11:14	Hoping my copy of @coltondixon's album comes today. That will make this day turn around. I'll have to beg my mom to bring it up to campus.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-31 01:57:47	One of my friends on Facebook posted a video from my youth group when I lived in England. It made me realize how much I miss it.. 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-31 02:59:26	Ahhhhh they're playing @Phillips at the end of Idol!!!!!! 😁😃
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-28 22:02:27	My @coltondixon CD and signed poster came today!! But I have to wait until tomorrow to get it because my mom can't bring it until then.. :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-31 04:03:40	This game is way to close for comfort. COME ON FLYERS!!! #BEATX
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-29 01:47:58	Messengers are proud of Colton.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-29 01:55:15	I looked exactly how a felt today: A hot mess. 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-29 01:56:10	@coltondixon I could not be more pound of you!! I love you so much!!! &lt;3
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-29 02:03:03	Getting my copy of @coltondixon's CD tomorrow!! I'm so excited!!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-29 03:11:57	Go follow @TimUrbanMusic so he can get to 38k!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-31 17:00:40	My brother leaves tomorrow. 😔 I feel like I barely got to see him since I've been at school. Going home tonight to see him before he leaves.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-01 04:17:37	@AnnieCog @coltondixon Oh my gosh!! You guys are too cute!!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-01 00:32:31	Lol at people who didn't realize @coltondixon's album came out two days ago. 😂
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-29 15:53:35	I can know hold @coltondixon's CD in my hand!!! 😍 http://t.co/ZiiNeSGb
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-01-31 02:35:03	Oh my goodness. The guy auditioning on Idol right now just blew me away. 😱
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-02 16:42:48	It was in the 60's earlier this week and today it's snowing. Yup. Gotta love Ohio weather. 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-02 18:35:56	I was going to go shopping today to get a dress for formal but the weather is to bad to got out... #annoyed 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-02 23:44:24	Can I have a relationship like @coltondixon an @AnnieCog someday please? ☺
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-01 03:00:08	@coltondixon Scars! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-01 13:56:07	I'm freezing. And I haven't even gone outside yet. 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-01 16:26:15	Well today was the first time I was locked out of my room. Guess there's a first time for everything.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-05 20:53:33	@AnnieCog @coltondixon And the cutest couple award goes to Colton and Annie!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-03 01:06:45	Some how my phone deleted all my contacts.... #pissed #annoyed 😡😡😡😡
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-03 03:33:44	Just found this and it made me cry. I really miss my doggie. 💔😢 http://t.co/7lHuvsmH
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-01 16:29:45	@Skylar_Laine Happy Birthday!! I hope you have a fantastic day!!! 🎉🎁😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-06 03:21:46	I really need to stop comparing myself to other people. It's not as bad as it used to be, but I still find myself doing it sometimes... :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-06 04:34:48	And Michigan beat Ohio State in over time!!! #GoBlue
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-04 00:05:46	Can tomorrow not be Monday?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-06 14:17:22	When you wake up from a dream and it takes you a minute to get back to reality and realize it was just a dream...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-06 16:57:33	Thanks for the short notice athletics... 😒😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-02 22:59:55	Seeing @ScottyMcCreery tweet about his tour makes me sad because he isn't coming to Ohio. 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-03 17:02:33	Come on ladies!! You can beat Richmond! #DaytonWBB #GoDaytonFlyers
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-03 21:23:03	The puppy bowl!! I think I might die of cuteness!! 😄😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-04 03:10:17	So I'm really not looking forward to this week. I have a feeling it's going to be a long one.. 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-04 03:29:42	Going to be good to be back at the gym tomorrow. Although I do enjoy being lazy and not always going on the weekends.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-06 23:57:18	Almost game time! #LetsGoFlyers
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-07 00:16:18	@coltondixon If only I were in San Antonio right now... :(
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-07 03:17:41	That was a close game but we won!! #GoDaytonFlyers
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-04 03:21:11	When ever I'm home I don't get tired until later. But when I'm back in my dorm I get tired at like 10...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-04 03:34:32	Alrighty. I think it's time to lay down. I'm suddenly feeling really tired...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-04 04:17:26	I've started to look up inspirational quotes whenever I'm feeling down. I always seem to find the perfect ones to make me feel better.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-04 04:53:00	Related to my last tweet. I fell victim to stressing about body image. But I'm getting over that now! I'm learning to accept myself!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-04 04:50:06	I'm sick of seeing tips on how to "flatten your belly" and similar stuff every where I look. No wonder young women struggle with image.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-04 04:56:23	And on that note I should probably try to go to sleep. I said I was going to lay down like an hour ago. 😜 #GoodnightTwitter
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-07 15:27:57	Women's basketball team plays Xavier tonight! #GoDaytonFlyers #BeatX 🏀
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-07 21:22:53	Excited to watch the @DaytonWBball take on Xavier tonight!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-07 21:37:33	I'm sleepy. I wish I could take a nap.. 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-07 22:32:52	I hate leaving class early because I feel like everyone is awkwardly staring at me as I walk out..... 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-05 16:01:18	I love not having class until noon! 😁 But I hate that I have to go until 9:00 on Tuesdays... 👎
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-05 03:46:17	Well today went better then I thought it would! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-05 05:01:11	When someone sends you a text that says "are you up?" you automatically think they're going to tell you bad news like someone died..... 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-08 02:05:52	And the women's basketball team beat Xavier tonight!! http://t.co/5g3tqTKs
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-05 16:51:53	Riding the struggle bus this morning. 🚌😠👎
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-08 14:17:10	I don't want to get out of bed and go to class... 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-09 00:18:36	Making dinner and listening to @coltondixon!!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-09 02:34:19	Might be a little early but I started looking at graduate schools that have a Social Work program. So far I'm looking at eight schools.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-09 03:39:50	Can't tell if I feel full from so much water or from eating. Probably water since I just chugged a bunch.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-09 03:57:18	Nicholas Sparks: Forever setting women's expectations for men high.  And an expert at making those same women cry.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-09 04:13:15	There's nothing better than laughing so hard you cry!! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-09 13:08:19	To early to be up on a Saturday... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-09 16:57:14	@AI12Retweet I wanna know!! :D
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-11 16:23:43	Can it be mid term break yet? Ugh.. Just two more weeks...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-10 23:27:18	Went for a walk with my dad and now I'm in a better mood! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-11 01:04:48	Didn't do my history homework and I'm trying to convince myself it's fine and I won't fail with this missing assignment.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-11 01:41:12	Can tomorrow not be Monday? Weekends are way to short... :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-11 02:26:21	Valentine's day is this week. Another reminder that I don't have a boyfriend and that I'm going to be a cat lady. I dislike this holiday. 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-13 05:57:57	Going to Philadelphia in 3 weeks to cheer on the women's basketball team at the A-10 tournament with the pep band. Second year in a row! 😁🏀
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-11 13:31:36	I really hope this is a good week and that it goes by fast.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-14 01:34:22	@SchylerDixon So sorry that you got cut. You don't need Idol. You're still amazing!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-14 21:07:16	My excuses for stuffing my face this afternoon is its valentines day and I don't have a valentine. But I worked out after so it's all good!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-14 21:45:48	I over analyze a situation and think it was worse then it probably was. It's a bad habit I'm over coming but one I still do sometimes.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-12 20:13:44	Another great workout this afternoon!! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-15 01:05:49	@Angiekmiller just killed it! She is amazing!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-15 01:09:03	@Phillips Oh my gosh!!!!!! I can't wait!! :D
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-15 01:16:26	Seriously. People like this made it through but Schyler didn't? 😡
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-15 05:02:36	Should probably be going to bed. #GoodnightTwitter 💤💤
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-13 01:34:53	My back is killing me... 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-15 14:56:57	So glad it's Friday. But I have a really busy weekend....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-13 14:55:04	It was a lot colder out this morning then I thought... 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-15 20:53:35	It was 50 degrees yesterday and it's snowing today.... 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-15 20:56:46	Time for drumline practice! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-13 18:52:17	@sarahloud15 Well I guess I can watch the second hour then. Since the game starts at 7 and Idol starts at 8! :D
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-13 19:44:43	Please keep my sociology teacher and her family in your prayers. Her father is in the hospital and she is having a rough time coping.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 04:23:12	I always tell myself I will try harder next time. Sometimes I do. Sometimes I don't.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 04:25:10	I've hit that point where I'm teetering between moving on to the next step and completely failing. I can't tell which way I'm leaning. :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-13 20:56:55	Was finally able to order a cross neck less like @ScottyMcCreery's!! His website finally got more and they weren't sold out yet!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-13 23:00:28	Thirty minutes left then I'm done for the day!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-14 01:53:14	I'm upset that @SchylerDixon was sent home. But I know this is not the end for her. She will do amazing things!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 04:52:25	I really need to stop over analyzing things. And I need to stop expecting immediate results. That's what makes this so much harder.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 04:53:38	I have seen some results and I need to accept that it's better then none at all and that in time I will see more.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 05:27:21	I need to find a way to get over this one. I will NOT let my self back track at this point. If it kills me I will get over this road block.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 05:32:18	Talking to my mom always helps. It may not solve the problem right at this moment but I know with her help I will find a solution! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 05:40:41	@SarahHurlburt Thank you!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 05:49:11	Just wasted a dollar on an app that I have to have IOS 6 or higher to use. You couldn't have told me that before I payed for it? 👎 Oh well.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 05:51:08	I want to have a new emoji app. But I can't find one that works. Any suggestions? And one that doesn't require IOS 6?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 05:57:01	@coltondixon Why do you have to do one when it's almost 1am? I need to get up early and now I won't sleep!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 05:58:50	Must stay awake. Must finally get a tweet from @coltondixon
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 05:59:34	@coltondixon Hey guess what? I love you and you are a huge inspiration to me!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 06:00:16	@SarahHurlburt Love you too! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 06:01:29	@coltondixon I'm tired so I don't know what to ask you. So I'll just say that I love you so much!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 06:05:29	I have never gotten a tweet @coltondixon. Will tonight be the night?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 06:16:07	@coltondixon I'm so tired I don't know what to ask you! So just know that you mean so much to me!!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 06:16:54	@SarahHurlburt Yeah. I saw him on the idol tour twice over the summer.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 06:18:57	@SarahHurlburt Haha. Good point. :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 14:18:13	Up early. Ugh... It's game day!! Go Flyers! #BEATX
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 14:31:10	It's defiantly a coffee kind of morning. Oh wait. That's every morning. 😜☕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 15:53:20	One thing I need to start is doing is have positive thought in the morning. Because it'll start the day off the right way!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 15:54:46	Game day! Then POD formal tonight!! Sorry negative thoughts you will have to take a back seat today! It's going to be a good day! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-11 20:32:55	Almost forgot that it's #BEATX week!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-12 00:27:10	My tummy hurts.... 😔
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-17 05:00:08	Formal was a lot of fun!! It was just what I needed!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-17 05:00:41	@Angiekmiller Happy Birthday!!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-10 00:10:36	A little coffee was just the energy boost I needed! 👍☕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 20:26:19	Flyers win!!!! It's 3:30pm and Xavier still sucks!!! http://t.co/X3c4wX4R
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-18 19:26:45	@DaytonWBball is ranked 14th in the nation!! Congratulations ladies and coach Jabir!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-18 23:03:25	#IWishICouldMeet @ScottyMcCreery. Every time I've tried to meet him it hasn't worked out. 😢 But someday I will!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-19 00:59:17	I'm thinking about studying abroad in England during summer of 2014!! 😁 🇬🇧
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-19 06:34:03	Been a long but good day. #GoodNightTwitter
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-20 21:31:39	So sleepy right now. Thankfully practice is only an hour today.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-13 16:29:59	Two more classes and then rehearsal. Boo! 👎But on the up side there is no game tonight so I can watch American Idol!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-13 17:00:22	I hate my back... 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-10 20:21:29	Zero motivation to do any work.... But I need to.. :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-10 22:04:31	Just kind in an ehhh kind of mood today. Not sure why though. 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-10 23:19:14	Cutting up an onion and my eyes are watering like crazy.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-14 16:19:30	Happy singles awareness day... I mean valentines day! 😜
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-14 17:00:14	Single for 20 valentines days. I think it's a record. Oh well. When I do find the one I won't need a certain day to tell him I love him.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-19 16:36:53	Yes! No practice tonight!! Which means I only have two classes!!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-14 23:35:32	My instructor forgot to give the quiz out at the end of class today so it's postponed until the next class. Which is Tuesday! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-19 21:52:05	I've been really off this week. Just need to tell myself that one week won't kill me. Just need to find a way to get passed this road block.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-16 22:51:52	When you're all dressed up and you get a complement from a guy! Best feeling ever!! ☺
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-19 21:53:32	I've also been really stressed. Maybe that's why I've gone off track. Maybe I need to find more ways to relax to help me get back on track.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-19 22:42:24	Going off track is party of the journey. You just have to be determined to get back on. Starting now am! No excuses. It's never to late.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-21 23:35:32	Wow! Tomorrow is Friday. This week has actually gone by really fast! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-21 23:37:19	@Angiekmiller Congratulations!! I'm so happy you made it!! Defiantly going to be voting for you! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-20 01:38:09	I've been such a fatty tonight. Worst I have down on a long time. But since I'm trying new ways I decided to just let go today. #OhWell
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-20 01:39:44	No more of this after today! Starting fresh tomorrow with ten times more dedication and determination.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-18 00:16:49	Concert went really well! Ended up talking with my parents for a while after. Overall another great day!! 😄👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-22 01:30:15	This guy tries to hard. He over does it when he performs. If he toned it way down he might actually be good.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-22 02:57:32	Really? It has to come down to these two? They were my two favorite of the night. 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-22 03:02:14	I'm happy that Devin made it but sad that Johnny didn't.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-18 02:40:19	There is a point where you might as well just give in and just try to start fresh the next day. I really need to get
over this road block :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-18 02:51:50	I know in order to find the correct way to do things we have to stumble and fall a few times first but it's so discouraging sometimes.... 😞😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-18 03:31:18	Go follow the beautiful @JessicaESanchez!! Help her get to 1 million!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-18 04:23:27	Except for going off track a little tonight this weekend was great!! And I know in time I will get passed this road block!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-20 15:00:28	Today's a new day! And good things will happen! Today is going to be a good day!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-20 15:01:16	Starting today I will have ten times more determination! No more wondering when I will get passed this road block. It starts NOW!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-20 15:05:32	I need to remember to start the day off with positive thoughts. Because then that puts me in a good mood and sets me up for a good day! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-18 05:56:33	Life will push you down at times. I used just give up when that happened. But now I refuse to give up. I WILL get passed this no matter what
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-18 05:59:20	I've come to far to give up now. I feel guilty when I go off track but I know I'll  feel so much worse then that if I completely give up.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-18 14:57:30	On the struggle bus already this morning. 😣 I just want to go the gym and work off all this negative energy..
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-22 16:40:58	Just one more class. Then drumline. Although I do kind of wish it was canceled this week so I could be done after my next class.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-22 16:59:35	#SongsThatMakeMeCry Clear As Day by @ScottyMcCreery
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-21 02:47:44	YES!!!!! @Angiekmiller made it through!!!!! 😊☺
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-22 22:18:50	So I have friends that go to Liberty University where Colton will be tonight... 😢 Needless to say I'm jealous.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-23 05:15:23	I think I about died when I saw @WJaredMartin dancing in the harlem shake video. 😂
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-23 14:11:03	Get in the car and the first thing my dad does is puts in @Phillips CD!! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-23 16:04:19	I seriously die every time I see @WJaredMartin in the harlem shake video. He has some serious dance moves. 😂
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-23 04:26:22	This time I mean it!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-23 19:24:02	I dropped my phone last night and it cracked my phone case. Sad day. 👎
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-23 19:31:26	@Haliib Very true! Lol
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-25 22:38:41	So sleepy. I wish I could take a nap. 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-26 00:11:17	@EbenOfficial Me maybe? 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-26 01:55:53	So my brother, his fiancée, and her parents get to go to Mexico. I'm jealous.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-23 22:48:09	Potentially have the chance of seeing @ScottyMcCreery in May. Crossing my fingers that it works out!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-23 23:34:00	Why yes I did just go to Walmart to get a second copy of @coltondixon's CD just for the bonus track. #IRegretNothing 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-26 04:03:04	@DaytonWBball is now ranked 12 in the nation!! Go Flyers!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-24 04:14:37	Starting is always the hardest part. But I can't keep putting it off. I've got to do this! It's time to dig down way deep and just do it!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-24 04:20:25	My dad is upstairs listening to @coltondixon!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-24 05:34:56	I'm going to have to push myself a lot harder then I thought. But one way or another I will do this!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-24 05:47:58	I feel so close. Like it's just around the corner. I just have to dig down deep and push my self to get around that corner.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-24 15:19:06	Did not sleep well at all last night....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-24 15:29:29	Are you kidding me you have to be 21 to see @ScottyMcCreery where I was thinking about going? I cannot believe this.... 😡
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-24 16:09:23	I'm really just about to give up. I'm never going to meet @ScottyMcCreery. No matter what I do it just doesn't seem to happen.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-24 18:02:20	I am just not having it today. #NotAGoodDay 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-24 18:23:30	😡😠😢😖😞😒 Basically sums up how I feel today.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-24 19:18:21	Maybe it's because I'm just in a bad mood but Temple's coach is rubbing me the wrong way...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-26 21:18:02	Don't want to go to class. I want to take a nap. But it's almost break. I can make it until then!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-26 21:48:45	This is the worst time of day to have class. It's so hard to concentrate... 😞😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-26 23:34:16	Pep band practice... 😣👎
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-26 23:35:16	@KenziLewis Gorgeous girl!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-27 02:02:04	So glad practice is over!! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-27 02:04:52	Dance Moms is such a dumb show. Yet it's really addicting to watch. 😝
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-25 00:35:09	Weekends go by way to fast. 😖 But at least there are only there days this week then it's midterm break!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-25 04:23:40	@sarahloud15 seems to be really excited about her mac n cheese.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-25 04:46:00	Ahhh!! I just love Jennifer Lawrence!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-27 19:33:53	I hate getting shots.... 😔
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-27 20:11:02	No better way to kick off the start of break then by getting two shots.... #NotFun
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-25 18:20:00	Gym time!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-03 01:53:15	@coltondixon @rhapsody What is your favorite thing to do on the tour bus? #ColtonRhap
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-03 01:58:59	Elf is on!!! I don't care that it's March. I will watch this movie any time of the year!!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-03 14:11:39	I need my coffee this morning.....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-03 15:05:38	Out to breakfast for my dad's birthday!!! Happy birthday to the best dad!! 😊🎉
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-28 01:31:31	The news said a girl they interviewed is the only Ohioan to make the top 24 on AI. Ever heard of @crystalbowersox and @EbenOfficial?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-28 19:42:47	Ran 4.11 miles in 45 min on the elliptical today and not on a low  resistance either! Maybe I will be able to do this 5K I'm signing up for!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-05 14:25:16	Been a while since I've been to the gym in the morning. Usually go in the afternoon. #EarlyMorningWorkout 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-05 16:12:18	Can it be Thursday yet? Actually more like Friday morning. I want to leave for Philadelphia already!!!! #excited
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-05 16:15:35	Messengers and all season 11 fan bases. Pray for @skoutlaw1992 and her family. God brought her home last night.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-05 16:57:34	Time for my English mid term.... 👎
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-02-28 22:37:11	Time for afternoon coffee!! ☕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-01 01:59:48	I don't feel good yet all I want to do is eat. Usually when I feel sick I can't eat. This doesn't make sense.... 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-01 02:00:58	And eating healthy today has gone down the tube. Oh well. I don't feel so good so I sort of don't care. But only sort of... 😣😰
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-01 02:41:06	Headache... 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-01 02:46:47	Yay yay yay!!!! @lazaromusic made it!!!!!!!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-01 03:05:27	@lazaromusic I loved it!! Congratulations!! I'm so happy you made it!!!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-01 06:06:11	I thought about going to bed at like ten because I had a headache. And here I am three hours later just now getting to bed... #OhWell
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-05 20:58:47	Yay for dentist appointment... Not... 👎😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-05 21:00:14	@DaytonWBball are ranked 11th in the nation!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-06 00:43:18	Two more days. Just two more days.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-06 03:10:24	I hope classes are canceled tomorrow. But I hope the gym stays open. I feel off if I don't get in my workout.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-06 06:00:09	When your mom and her friend leave sarcastic comments to one of your friends and you're unsure if you should apologize to your friend or not
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-06 14:59:31	No snow day. And UD didn't open until 10. Didn't do me any good since my fist class is at 10. 👎
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-06 15:54:51	I walk across campus in the cold just to be in my first class for 15 minutes. Then have to walk back across campus to get back to my room. 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-06 19:59:25	I always feel great after working out!! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-07 04:22:33	This is so frustrating and stressing. And stressing about it makes it worse... 😖😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-07 05:15:09	I guess maybe to the constant up and down shows that I'm making some improvement because I know when I have fallen off track.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-07 05:16:53	And when I look at how my habits where a year ago in some areas it is better. I just need to work harder to change the others.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-02 04:04:22	When I was little I used to hate putting on my pajamas. Now I want to put them on as soon as I'm done going out in public for the day.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-02 05:37:31	@devinpdexter Happy Birthday!!! :D
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-02 15:38:13	My dad is upstairs listening to @ScottyMcCreery!!! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-03 23:36:55	@DaytonWBball went 14-0 this season in the A-10!!! Good job ladies! Can't wait to go cheer them on in Philadelphia with the Flyer Pep band.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-04 02:37:39	14-0 in the A-10. 26-1 overall!! Great job ladies!! Proud to be a Flyer!!! http://t.co/PeQaXhnKXC

55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-04 13:09:03	Can break not be over? Because that would be great.....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-04 21:43:25	This is the worst time of day to have class. #tired 😔
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-05 00:14:49	I really love how nice it was outside today!! Felt like spring! 😄🌸
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-07 06:32:05	Everything always seems so much worse at night.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-07 06:37:06	Beating myself up doesn't help the situation. Letting it go is the better choice. It's not easy but to do it's what needs to be done.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-07 15:52:32	Stressful night sets up for a long bad day. But I'm determined to not let that happen!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-07 15:55:05	I need to not concentrate on things I've done and wish I hadn't. I have to stop living in the past. I can't move forward living in the past.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-07 16:02:34	@coltondixon @WJaredMartin @DavidDitrich @devinpdexter and @EAdrums are all in Ohio tonight and I can't see them. I'm going to go cry now. 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-09 18:55:56	@DaytonWBball win!!! Good job ladies!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-09 22:57:43	Tournament season is so stressful.... Gotta love college Basketball... 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-09 23:22:50	Thank goodness Fordham won!! Now the men are headed to the A-10 tournament!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-11 16:12:15	Great great weekend!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-11 16:13:35	@TimUrbanMusic This is just one of the many reasons why I think you're amazing!!  :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-07 19:40:12	Skipping my morning coffee and having tea instead was a bad idea. I feel off now. Not doing that again.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-07 19:59:40	Is @SchylerDixon going to be at this show tonight? If so that makes me more upset that it's only a few hours from me and I can't go. #sadday
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-07 22:05:00	I'm so need for this weekend. Going to Philadelphia, spending it with friends, and cheering on @DaytonWBball will make for a perfect time!

55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-12 00:46:04	I don't want to study.... 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-08 10:39:26	To early to be up. But yet I'm wide awake right now. I'll probably end up crashing on the bus later.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-12 18:06:52	Woodwinds and our bus driver Keith in Philly!! http://t.co/A7lOdwkM99
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-12 18:13:49	We are the flyer pep band!! http://t.co/b748wizKHw
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-12 22:21:35	I hate cravings. I've gotten good at ignoring them. Except when it's that time of the month. And lately they've been bad..... 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-10 06:41:11	I am so sleepy. Not looking forward to getting up early.... 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-10 12:37:57	Too early.... 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-13 19:14:36	It needs to be Monday because I really want to know what seed @DaytonWBball get, where they're going, and who they're playing.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-14 00:20:10	Nope sorry. This is no where near as good as Scotty. Scotty did WAY better. #justsayin
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-14 00:21:03	She wasn't bad. I just liked Scotty's performance better.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-14 00:22:39	Sign that our bus driver made for the front of the bus this past weekend. 😃👍 http://t.co/7g93qf5AEY
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-14 01:12:15	@LazaroAI12 is so adorable!! I love him!!! 😃😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-14 02:46:02	And that's why I don't text first....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-14 02:54:27	Well at least I tried. And on that note I'm going to bed.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-14 03:32:05	So much for sleep. To much on my mind all of a sudden... :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-14 03:47:32	Confused...... May be over thinking things because it's late.. But I'm still confused... :/ #ugh
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-14 05:18:13	And this is why I need to talk to another girl about this.... And not a guy..... :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-14 05:36:48	That talk helped me feel better.. NOT. Still confused and don't know what the heck is going on.....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-10 21:23:34	No matter what I will always support @DaytonWBball!! Once a flyer always a flyer!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-11 06:29:01	Back in Dayton. Time to go pass out and sleep for like a week.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-14 15:55:55	I'm in much much better mood then I was last night! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-09 05:24:48	I barely eat fast food but this weekend I have to since I'm traveling. It doesn't keep me full for long. It sucks. I feel unhealthy. 😖😞😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-09 14:58:04	It's game day!! Time to go cheer on @DaytonWBball with the @FPBupdates!!! #GoDaytonFlyers
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-14 20:34:06	I can't handle this. Come on Dayton. I don't understand why all of a sudden with so little time left you let yourselves fall further behind.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-14 20:43:09	Can't. Handle. This. I'm going to have a heart attack. 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-15 00:39:13	PHILLIP!!!!!!! 😁😄
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-15 00:41:26	Realizing that the last time Phillip was performing on this stage I was crying my eyes out because I so happy he won!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-15 20:41:57	The amount of food I can eat sometimes is amazing. Lol. Gotta get back eating healthy ASAP!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-16 00:40:49	Apparently I'm running sectionals on Wednesday.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-18 13:54:46	Can I please go back to sleep? 😴
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-18 13:57:54	It's a struggle bus morning... 🚌
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-16 02:02:58	@sarahloud15 I know. I was confused by that.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-16 02:37:07	@AI12Retweet thanks! :D
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-16 03:15:41	@MikeMGarner Any chance there will be any Ohio shows added to Weekend Road Trip? :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-15 00:43:12	4 million?? Ahhhh. I could not be more proud of him!!!!!! 😊

55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-21 03:34:41	@LazaroAI12 You're amazing!! Don't let it get to you! You have an amazing talent and will do great things with it!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-21 03:38:48	@devinpdexter Don't deny it! We know you did! :P
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-20 13:09:26	Need more sleep. Thank goodness for coffee! 👍☕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-22 04:09:03	So glad @AngieAI12 @LazaroAI12 and @DevinAI12 were all safe tonight!!! 😀
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-23 03:16:16	When you realize the basketball from @ScottyMcCreery's school (NC state) was two buses in front of you at the airport tonight in Dayton.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-23 03:27:13	Called it. But at least I found out sooner rather then later.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-22 16:00:08	Guess who is finally going to get to meet @ScottyMcCreery in June? This girl right here!!! 😁😄 #excited
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-23 05:42:57	Can't sleep. Traveling always messes up my sleeping cycle. Even if it was just a few hours travel time and we didn't change time zones. 😫
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-23 13:15:24	Spending the day in NYC!!! ❤😁👍

55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-01 03:34:43	Do we really need videos of Kevin Ware getting hurt? It was horrible enough watching it the first time. Why would you want to see it again?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-01 17:35:41	One of my close friends from high school just revealed that her and her hubby are having a baby girl!! Super excited for them!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-01 20:28:03	Have to do an interview for section leader now because so many people want the position. As if I didn't have enough to do already...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-28 00:58:24	I can't believe how amazing the New York trip was!! One of the best trips ever!!! 😊❤
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-28 01:17:27	American Idol time. 😜 #MotownThrowdown

55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-03-28 17:39:32	Slept in until noon. 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-02 15:59:02	I'm going to be pretty much living in the library today. Busy busy day. #BringItOn #leggo
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-02 20:38:50	Why am I just now finding out that @KrisAllen is going to be in Dayton this Friday?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-02 22:41:47	Library trip take two.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-05 18:56:03	Crisis averted.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-05 22:14:07	Dropped my cymbal at practice and it fell on my ankle now I have lovely red bump. 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-04 22:00:03	Down side to listening to Classical music with headphones is constantly changing to volume so you can hear the piece or so you don't go deaf
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-06 04:12:58	And @sarahloud15 just threw the remote behind the bed....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-05 15:35:06	I strongly dislike making phone calls.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-07 18:58:06	I'm so upset that I can't watch the men's national championship game tomorrow because I have to perform at celebration of the arts. 😩
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-07 01:14:48	Almost game time! #GoBlue #FinalFour
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-09 02:38:28	I hate getting missed calls from numbers I don't know..... 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-08 20:12:08	Been here for almost two hours and we still haven't rehearsed yet.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-09 17:05:32	I've almost fallen asleep in this class several times today...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-09 17:47:06	It's going to take me forever to finish this paper if I keep miss spelling every other word.....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-09 19:15:21	My mom asked me if I had heard @ScottyMcCreery new single. Is that question really necessary?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-09 20:13:08	Interview over. Now it's time to be paranoid until I find out if I get section leader.

55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-10 01:36:24	There needs to be a show called Band Moms.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-10 01:36:37	@sarahloud15 @dancemoms I agree!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-10 21:24:56	iMessage why aren't you working? 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-10 22:40:59	Felt like my lips were swelling at the end of practice so that was making it difficult to play.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-12 13:17:09	Why does your bed have to become the most comfortable and warmest thing in the world when you actually have to try and get up?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-11 00:51:12	It would start raining after I'm outside and didn't bringing a jacket....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-11 00:53:48	@Truby_Brian I had one earlier. I just forgot it this time.

55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-12 16:37:05	I would be the person that has a soda explode all over me in the middle of class...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-12 19:10:27	Well then... #frustrated #annoyed 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-10 16:33:09	I really do have the back of an old person. I probably should stop putting off going to the doctor.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-10 16:36:15	@Truby_Brian Agreed.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-10 17:01:25	The men's basketball players are the only people I can pass on campus and feel short.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-11 17:34:58	4:30 class is canceled!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-16 18:29:28	One month until the @Phillips concert!!

55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-18 20:02:12	I don't wanna go to class... 😕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-18 20:43:20	Looks like I'm actually going to be done with exams on the Monday of exam week instead of Tuesday!! I'm perfectly fine with this!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-18 16:02:22	The whole no class thing yesterday has really thrown off my week. It doesn't feel like Thursday. 😩
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-19 16:06:19	@gramofthehill @anniecog @coltondixon Yay!! I'm so glad you finally got a picture with Colton!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-19 13:57:29	A bombing and a shooting all in the same week booth in the city where my cousin lives... 😕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-19 16:00:45	80 degrees yesterday. 40 degrees today. Really Ohio?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-19 16:21:54	I get ripped apart by my peers on how I did for my presentation but my instructor gives me a B. And the point of my peers opinion was?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-19 17:52:40	I have less then 150 dollars left to spend on food before the end of the semester! I have less then two weeks. Time to start wasting money!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-19 18:32:24	Totally almost did a face plant on the floor while trying to get off my bed. My desk chair isn't the best step stool.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-22 22:19:54	Let me just smash my fingers right before a concert where I have to hold onto cymbals... 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-22 23:46:20	Percussion concert tonight! #leggo http://t.co/GBbyuzytWg
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-23 04:18:38	Have to be up uber early for a doctors appointment tomorrow.... 👎😑
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-19 16:06:56	@Truby_Brian True story. But it's been moved inside.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-19 16:10:14	@Truby_Brian Yeah. Kind of defeats the purpose of a picnic if its inside.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-19 16:19:55	@gramofthehill @anniecog @coltondixon you're welcome!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-21 17:05:21	Final concert this afternoon! 😬 #leggo
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-23 16:58:13	Spent three hours at the hospital for one appointment....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-21 23:29:41	Major food baby right now.... 😩 But dinner was delicious. 😋
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-23 21:38:13	I hate allergies. And the constant changing weather is making them worse. 😕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-24 17:19:21	Starting physical therapy today.....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-25 16:00:52	Having a sneezing fit in class..... 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-26 13:57:22	Last day if classes!! #Finally
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-28 17:16:33	Time to be productive today. Even I have to be taped down to a chair I need to get work done.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-25 22:51:35	I need to try and be productive at some point before the day is over.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-28 23:28:49	My brain is dead..... 😕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-29 00:51:28	People....... 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-26 15:57:38	Last class of the semester!!!!! 😁👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-30 18:32:56	Officially done with my sophomore year of college!! How am I halfway done with college? Where has the time gone?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-30 18:36:13	@Truby_Brian I see how it is. 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-27 01:51:43	I hate my back.....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-27 02:33:29	My boyfriend is the best!! @Truby_Brian  😊💐 http://t.co/ktOmKR0jtK
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-01 20:16:04	Thanks a lot St. John's for charging me multiple times for things I bought at the NCAA women's tournament.... 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-01 22:58:21	@Truby_Brian @flymbal12 I got charged twice for the shirt and pin I bought at the game when we were in NY.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-01 23:00:05	@Truby_Brian @flymbal12 Yeah. And we still haven't gotten a hold of someone at St. John's yet.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-01 23:00:38	@flymbal12 Yeah. But had to leave a message and they haven't called back yet.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-30 22:18:10	An there is no one at the desk so I can't check in.... 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-30 22:52:51	@Truby_Brian I have no clue. Probably because there aren't a lot of people checking in right now.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-04-30 23:40:24	And I can't find my batman sunglasses.... 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-02 03:12:43	My brother wants to watch Sinister.... Looks like I want be sleeping tonight.... 😥
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 14:45:02	You know there is something wrong when you walk outside in May in Arkansas and freeze....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-02 05:50:24	I've come to a conclusion. I think I'm allergic to Ohio.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-02 05:55:33	@Truby_Brian Haha. It's actually more like I'm probably allergic to a certain kind of pollen that's in Ohio.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-02 05:59:01	@Truby_Brian Hahaha. That's gotta be it!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-02 06:02:45	@Truby_Brian I understand them every once in a while!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 19:27:20	I don't understand. Did someone take a bite out of this or what? http://t.co/4VzQllnjEf
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-02 17:58:24	Oh yeah!! #yum http://t.co/OHL0AnzaTP
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-02 18:37:11	@Truby_Brian When are you not hungry? Haha
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-02 18:53:51	My brother and I have both gotten calls from numbers we don't know within the last twenty minutes. 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-01 16:58:24	So tired. Did not sleep well at all last night.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-01 18:43:40	My whole family is probably judging me for watching Dance Moms right now. #idontcare
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 20:06:47	New shades. 👓😛 http://t.co/Lio6MjAZTN
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 20:45:25	I never knew the goldfish crackers actually had names. http://t.co/ifw6v02xw5
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 20:59:20	Just passed a car where the guy driving was jamming out to what ever music he was listening to. It was pretty amusing.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 21:40:36	"Don't pay no mind to the demons they fill you with fear." Seeing @Phillips in less than two weeks!! #excited
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 00:26:36	David Cook!! 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 23:06:45	Suddenly not feeling to good... 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 00:34:19	This is painful to watch. They just destroyed the Charleston (and not in a good way).... 😑
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 01:34:51	This would be my band director from high school.. 😂 #ohdear http://t.co/oHs81mMeW1
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-04 00:00:11	It still hasn't fully hit me that I'm half way done with college. I think I'm in denial.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-04 00:37:46	I hate being on the high way when it's down poring. It makes me nervous even if I'm not the one driving.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 02:47:06	I love how it smells after in rains in the summer time!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 03:00:44	I'm going to blame my brother when I can't sleep tonight..... :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 03:19:00	Not five minutes in and I was creeped out.....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 03:55:15	My parents just insulted my major... #ouch
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 04:29:00	My dad just pointed out that it's perfect camping weather. Now I want to go camping.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 04:30:40	@Truby_Brian Awesome!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 05:14:15	It's supposed to snow. In Arkansas. In May. Thankfully it's not the part I'm in but still.....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-04 01:44:54	I feel like a zombie...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-04 02:43:31	I was excited to see that I had a final grade posted and that it was an A. Then I saw it was just pep band.....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-04 04:17:26	Finally......
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-04 04:59:34	Finally able to sleep in a bed and not on a couch! And I'll be back in my own bed to tomorrow!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 05:18:03	It's obvious I have out grown my scary movie phase... Probably going to have trouble falling asleep.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-03 05:29:34	Oh the jokes my family makes this late. 😂
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-05 00:04:42	Finally back home in Dayton after a very long, but pretty good, week!! Finally starting to feel like summer break.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-04 22:17:37	Finally home!!! 😊
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-04 22:41:52	And they're pretty much dead... http://t.co/S3sGQkcJoa
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-05 03:27:48	First time being in my own bed in over a month. If feels wonderful!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-06 21:45:12	How I'm spending part of my afternoon. Breaking out the old music I played in high school. #memories http://t.co/lV8Oei7OWc
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-07 00:06:05	"You usually find what you're looking for, the moment you stop looking for it."
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-05 16:10:17	Congratulations to all University of Dayton graduates!! Once a flyer always a flyer! #flyerfaithful
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-07 19:45:07	My mom was taking a survey but she didn't want to write down the real names of our family so I had her put my name down as Josephine.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-06 02:51:41	@stevi_nic_k I know we don't talk all that much but I'm here if you need anything! Even if it's just to vent.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-09 21:05:52	*Sigh* My mom can bring up the most awkward things sometime... But that's what moms are best at sometimes. Haha
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-10 01:05:19	Well then.......
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-07 21:11:54	I don't understand why I randomly have trouble breathing sometimes when I'm even not doing anything to make me short of breath.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-07 21:50:07	It feels like there is a bunch of extra weight sitting on my chest.... #notgood
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-08 18:57:15	My legs are sore after I have trouble sleeping the night before. Probably form all the wired positions I lay in trying to get comfortable.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-08 01:23:45	I'm freezing. I shouldn't be this cold in May....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-08 02:25:08	I'm suddenly starting to feel like an adult. How can I make this stop?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-08 20:24:19	It is dangerous for me to go into a pet store.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-08 20:48:35	@KenziLewis Happy Birthday!!' Hope you have a fantastic day!! 😃
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-08 21:54:24	My dad has more of my senior pictures in his office then he does for both of my brothers. Does this mean I'm his favorite? 😜😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-08 23:59:47	Home just in time for Idol!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-09 00:45:17	And cue the tears while watching home town visits.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-09 01:25:42	Can I just go give @KreeAI12 a hug?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-07 16:08:43	#sadday 😞 But at least it's going to be rescheduled. http://t.co/7FR5eDoU3j
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-10 20:05:40	Watching Four Weddings and seeing some of the budgets I'm pretty sure my dad would have a heart attack if my wedding cost that much.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-09 04:37:03	@KenziLewis Happy Birthday girl!! I hope you have a wonderful day!! 😃💜
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-10 21:43:44	My phone has doing all sorts of funky things.... 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-10 21:56:08	@Truby_Brian Yeah... I blame yours 😜
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-10 22:02:08	@Truby_Brian I was only kidding! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-10 22:58:37	Good news: I still get to see Phillip Phillips in concert. Bad News: I have to wait until November… http://t.co/TkIZ10ggZ6
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-11 01:05:37	I walk outside for less than five minutes and my hair turns into a giant ball of frizz... 😒😑
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-09 16:04:53	When your phone goes off in your hand because of an Amber Alert and is scares you so bad you almost throw it across the room... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-11 21:55:32	Mother's Day shopping complete. Nothing like doing it the day before.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-12 00:10:58	When I found this the Ohio State one was on top. But it's okay, I fixed it! 😛 http://t.co/Gcy69RsZnC
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-12 00:49:56	Summer storm is on its way. http://t.co/jYTJDkSPXi
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-12 02:42:00	I kind of want to throw my phone out a window right now.... 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-12 03:57:05	I almost died when I saw this one. #bandhumor http://t.co/NcLD4JiDnQ
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-13 16:31:24	The perks of playing the flute! 👍 http://t.co/LQLZOrJT3F
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-15 22:05:17	I hate when I step outside and I get attached by something flying....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-15 23:03:18	Watching Man V. Food when you're hungry is a bad idea... #ineedfood
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-16 05:19:49	It's after 1am and I'm wide awake. So now I probably won't be getting up earlier than I have been like I was going to try an do.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-13 20:11:55	I've seen my last name spelled wrong. But my first name. Now that's a new one http://t.co/wWU0Sp10wI
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-12 17:51:14	I think my parents enjoy pointing out that the only person I text is my boyfriend. I have such a big social life....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-13 22:36:40	Can I get a new back please? 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-13 23:02:29	@TimUrbanMusic You're amazing!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-13 23:07:43	@TimUrbanMusic You're welcome!! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-13 23:11:47	@Truby_Brian Yes. Yes you are! :P
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-13 23:14:33	@Truby_Brian Kidding! I like it too.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-13 23:31:07	I just found out that my brother doesn't like the movie Elf. 😳 This is not okay...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-14 00:06:05	Dang @kelliepickler has some serious moves!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-12 18:48:10	Haha. More band humor.
#bandhumor http://t.co/9c9Uo11wUi
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-12 18:53:44	Having to explain band jokes to my parents... Only if my brothers were here, they would understand them.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-17 01:45:29	@KrisAllen will forever have to greatest reaction to winning Idol.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-17 02:10:25	Better not be another storm tonight... I can't do another night with little sleep.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-12 20:26:56	My friend who is a senior just said this is the last time she'll be doing homework on the weekend. Hahahahahahaha. Wait until college starts
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-12 21:50:18	I think my phone is sick... I see a trip to the Verizon store in the near future.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-13 00:15:34	Picked up my phone charger and the cord was in the shape of a heart (well somewhat anyways). 👍 http://t.co/q6Ly0RFQQz
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-14 03:36:21	Down side to being the last one awake is I think every noise I hear is someone breaking in and they're going to murder me..... 😳😫
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-17 22:09:36	Whenever I have to use a big knife I'm afraid I'm going to severely cut myself.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-14 19:25:57	Yup. It's true. Haha http://t.co/dHguhQJFVl
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-17 22:27:47	So the assistant band director from my high school is moving. Even though I graduated tow years ago this is upsetting news... :(
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-18 00:46:13	"When I was haunted and alone with this baggage on my back dragging me down, you set me free." Great song 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-16 22:34:34	I'm in a really weird mood today... 😕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-18 01:53:12	Sarcasm: Something my parents don't understand.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-13 15:28:37	My mom read the menu for my brother's rehearsal dinner for his wedding. Guess who's going to be a total fatty that weekend....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-14 21:09:34	I still have a bump on my ankle where I dropped my cymbal on it over a month ago... #lovely 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-14 23:03:46	My back is on fire.... 😳😔
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-18 17:32:04	It's a struggle bus kind of day. 🚌
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-17 00:39:08	Geez Nikki please try and contain your excitement...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-17 00:46:51	I think there should be subtitles with this performance. #justsayin
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-15 00:28:53	Near death moment number two for the day: Hiccuping and almost chocking on my gum.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-15 01:11:12	There is this guy on Instagram that doesn't follow me but he keeps liking my pictures.... #creepedout 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-15 01:12:43	Oh and to add to it there not even my newer pictures. So that means he's creeping on my pictures...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-19 16:02:38	I finally figured out how to describe my dancing style. I dance like Mr. Bean.....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-21 23:45:18	Mushu is pretty much my favorite character in Mulan.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-20 20:54:59	Yay for new phone cover! And a new tank top that came in the mail today as well!! 😁👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-18 20:09:48	Gorgeous!! 😍 http://t.co/eaoRJ9MqwX
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-22 23:26:44	That moment when something on TV is so annoying you want to throw a giant rock at your TV to make it shut up rather than pressing mute.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-23 00:47:12	You know you're home alone when you keep replaying a cat video on YouTube because it's funny and nobody is home to judge you.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-20 23:58:32	Saw a video of a dog winning during the scene in The Lion Kong when Mufasa dies. I'm 20 and respond the same way. I cry every time.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-21 02:01:37	What would someone want to be a storm chaser? It's so dangerous.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-19 00:01:34	It's warm outside and I'm freezing. This makes no sense.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-21 02:06:34	@Truby_Brian Maybe to you. Haha. Not for someone like me.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-21 02:14:32	@Truby_Brian Can't I do something a little less crazy first? You know ease into it? Haha
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-21 02:17:38	@Truby_Brian @cedarpoint Haha. Okay. I think I can do that!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-21 02:18:20	@KatieVanKeuren @Truby_Brian Haha. Sounds like a plan!!!

55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-23 19:32:41	When your mom starts humming one of the songs you played in marching band last season and before you know it your singing the whole show.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-23 22:57:00	I have a bunch of random scratches on my leg and I have no idea how they got there....

55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-24 02:29:37	@Truby_Brian One of the brides on the show forgot to bring her grooms ring to the wedding.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-24 02:32:43	@Truby_Brian Yeah. And I thought I was forgetful.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2013-05-25 21:51:24	I was just about to fall asleep and then my mom decides to poke me scaring me and now I'm wide awake. So much for a nap. #ohwell

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-02-18 19:22:03	I send a text and it goes right away but then another can take several minutes to deliver. Or it doesn't send and I don't notice at first. 😔

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-03-24 18:34:04	I need a nap. 😴😴
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-03-24 21:48:55	I wish I could nap but I need to be productive. The struggle is real. Guess I'll be responsible so I can reduce my stress level.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-03-24 23:13:45	If I could go a day without back pain that would be great. But at least it's a stiff feeling not verses the stabbing pain I've been having.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-03-24 23:16:20	“@PupsPorn: Whatcha readin? ~ http://t.co/dXTjsngK1A” I'd be ok with having this study buddy! 😊🐶

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-03-30 19:38:55	I dislike my back. Ugh. But at least it's more of an uncomfortable stiffness right now and now the stabbing sharp pain I've been having.

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-04 19:16:24	Might kill someone today. Not really since it's illegal but the lack of communication from my group is pissing me off. Group projects suck.😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-02 15:01:20	You know you're tired when someone walks by and the umbrella they're carrying looks like a dog out of the corner of your eye. Hahaha 😳😜

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-07 22:43:13	Hurts to sit. Hurts to stand. And hurts to walk. Upper thigh is the worst place to pull a muscle. 😢😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-09 23:35:18	Been getting a lot of random follows lately.... Just a bit creepy...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-10 13:19:39	Not sure if chirping birds first thing after waking up are annoying or soothing. Hmmm...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-10 13:27:30	The smell of coffee in the AM!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-10 13:55:27	That sad moment when your flowers are slowing dying...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-13 20:05:09	Turns on oven and the whole main floor feels like a oven...  #itsgettinghotinhere 😐😲
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-13 21:05:32	It might snow on Tuesday.. You've got be to kidding me. 😒 But at least it's not tomorrow. But still....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-13 00:08:49	What up with all the follows from people I don't know/tweet nothing similar to them. How the heck do you find me out millions on this site?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-13 01:05:42	“@LifeLimits: Be strong, for it may be stormy now, but it can't rain forever.” Need to remember that #truth

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-11 14:42:00	Done with the last lab! Don't even care anymore that we started like 15 minutes late. No more getting up at 6:45am on Fridays! 😁👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-11 14:57:51	And in two out of my three remaining classes are presentations. Not presenting in either today so I just have to sit a watch.

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-11 16:14:42	Dig this weather!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-14 00:39:13	When this group project is done and presented tomorrow I will be so happy. I dislike doing group projects.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-11 18:00:06	Almost done! But considering this class is just presentations it shouldn't be to bad. 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-10 22:35:51	Happy national siblings day to my big brothers Mike and Chris!! Also throw back to when we lived in a… http://t.co/EmmTgURyZQ
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-15 21:37:41	Left side of my face is still numb. If feels swollen like I got punched. I hate having to get fillings. :(
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-18 18:13:19	That awkward moment when you discover your pants don't have front pockets..... #really #stupid 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-20 16:19:35	Happy Easter!! He is risen!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-25 13:26:06	Yay! Almost done! :D
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-23 13:22:36	Nervous... 😑
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-27 23:21:20	Seriously? How does that even happen? 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-28 00:04:40	No motivation right now.... #badday :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-28 23:11:57	Almost to the end. Just a few more days. #almostthere
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-28 23:28:54	Feel sick to my stomach now... Not a good show to watch after eating...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-01 13:28:19	T-minus five hours......
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-01 17:47:22	Words of wisdom from my mother before my final: When in doubt mark C.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-01 20:50:44	It's a bit to chilly to have the back door open. #freezing 😮
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-01 23:42:24	New laptop needed. Switching to digital photography and this one won't cut it. Plus mine dies after being unplugged for 15 minutes or less.😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-29 19:25:08	TV host: My little brother is a piccolo.
Me: Well duh it's a flute.
Contestant: uhh.. Trombone. Uhhh... Trumpet 
Me: *face palm* Seriously?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-04-30 21:57:50	Bunny rabbit that's been living under the deck. 🐰 http://t.co/jXMBHLyhqi
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-03 01:00:41	And I'm done!!! Honestly didn't think I could make it to the end of the semester when it first started but I did!!! :D
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-04 21:21:35	Holy crap that was hot..... :(
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-04 21:29:18	Mindlessly looking through Facebook and Twitter over and over when you're bored... Yup...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-04 21:33:39	When random pages tweet you and say you have won a prize and to click on the link.... Yeah no... I'm not stupid enough to do that.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-04 22:07:44	If I drop one more thing..... 😤 #StruggleBus
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-03 13:48:29	Can my room pick a comfortable temp? I either wake up freezing or hot....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-04 21:42:58	My face feels funny now 😕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-07 16:35:03	Getting nervous..... 😫😰
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-08 23:32:42	I need food! #hungry 😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-10 00:14:11	I should have super vision while I'm cooking/baking. The worst injury I've had is burning myself but I have way to many close calls. Haha 😮😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-10 00:45:52	Back pain... #notcool
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-08 23:57:46	I might kill someone if I don't eat soon. I hate waiting.... #annoyed 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-12 16:30:14	Well then... What a great day this is Turing out to be.... Not.... 😠😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-12 17:04:30	I should eat but the thought of food makes me want to puke... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-11 20:45:21	Well then... :( #crappymood #strugglebus
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-13 20:17:51	Burning up getting into my car this afternoon.... 😓 But at least it cools down quickly. 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-12 17:58:51	I really wish I wasn't home alone right now... Feeling really lonely 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-12 22:09:08	Driving home from filling up my car and there is a random toilet on the side of the road. #classy
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-12 00:42:43	Blaaaahh. It's one of those days... :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-12 02:17:45	Almost stabbing yourself in the eye with a fork..... Yep... 😑
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-13 00:08:43	That awkward moment when you put clothes in the dyer and realize an hour later you didn't start it. Sad part is this isn't the first time. 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-11 00:56:34	Lazy days are nice but I really hope I get a job soon or I will die of boredom. So far had one interview and still applying to other places.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-14 21:19:14	Not liking this bad weather when I'm by myself. Actually this kind of weather makes my anxiety spike even if I'm not alone... 😐😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-17 00:43:58	It's May. It shouldn't be cold enough to have the heat on. 😑
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-17 01:58:06	Love the Chevrolet commercial with military families being reunited! So heart warming. 😊❤️💛
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-16 23:28:01	I need food! #hungry
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-15 23:12:38	Watching a TV show about sweets is not a good idea while I'm hungry.... 😯
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-18 19:50:15	Pet peeve of mine is when I ask someone to help me and they say "one minute" and more than an hour later they still haven't helped. 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-18 01:54:06	Talking wedding plans with my best friend. Holy crap she's greeting married in August. 😳😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-16 13:49:30	Freezing.... 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-16 14:02:36	Today is already slowly turning into another struggle bus day......
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-18 00:55:52	Six hour phone call with my mom. Next best thing to her being here when I need someone to talk to. ❤️💜
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-19 18:33:56	Could my laptop take any longer to start up? 😒 Every time I use it something happens that reminds me I really need a new one ASAP!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-19 03:50:34	Fingers crossed that my copy of @Phillips new album comes tomorrow like Amazon said it would. #BehindTheLight
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-20 19:53:08	My signed copy of @Phillips new album came today! Also got one for my dad! 👍 #BehindTheLight http://t.co/BUIeeADOtl
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-24 19:40:43	Maybe if I did a better job of cleaning I wouldn't freak out about it so much when people come over. 😞 Hope I do better with my own place.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-23 18:06:23	@Little__Leesha I wanted to cry when I saw those pictures 😢
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-25 01:34:13	"She doesn't even go here!" #MeanGirls
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-27 01:21:46	To finish of dinner just had homemade blueberry cheese cake! #yum #fatty #iregretnothing 😋😋
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-29 14:45:44	Been having really strange/realistic dreams at night lately...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-29 21:57:07	My high school's graduation is tonight. The kids that are graduating were freshman when I was a senior. I'm feeling really old.... 😳😕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-31 02:32:26	Sorry for all the retweets. Actually I'm not hahaha. I'm just really bored. 😶
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-31 16:03:23	Great..... 😢😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-05-31 17:28:23	Nervous nervous nervous. Job interview in an hour. 😦😮😬
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-01 00:12:22	Bored and feeling meh... Not a good combo.. 😕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-01 20:29:57	That's cool.... #merp #annoyed #ugh 😕😒😞
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-01 20:43:43	And today went downhill fast...... 😶😑
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-01 21:05:20	I thought naps were supposed to fix bad moods... Not make them worse. 😢😣 #blaaah
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-01 22:19:57	That depressing moment when you want to cuddle but your cuddle buddy isn't here....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-03 00:43:28	You can always rely on Whose Line is it Anyway for a good dirty joke. Hahahaha 😂
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-03 18:49:10	Stressed. Anxious. #merp 😐
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-03 01:07:36	I seriously need a job soon or I'm going to go insane sitting around bored out of my mind all summer. Praying something works out soon.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-03 23:10:03	It's just one of those days.... #merp :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-03 21:18:44	Well that was more painful/difficult than it should have been. I hate running into issues involving computers... #annoyed 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-07 16:09:57	Maybe it's just me but I think getting married a week after you graduate high school is just a bit to young. #justsayin
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-07 00:02:03	@hannuhbbyz I will bake you a cake if you come to Ohio! :)
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-10 13:59:39	Me: I'll just close my eyes for a few minutes before I get up. *wakes up 20 minutes later* #opps #ohwell
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-11 16:20:46	Go away rain no one likes you.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-11 18:14:04	When I call someplace I would appreciate it if I could be connected to some place where I can speak to a person and not a recording.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-12 13:48:59	*Yawns* #sleepy
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-13 13:36:58	My mind says get up but my bed says no. #struggle
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-10 23:15:27	Every time I see someone say they got a job I get a little more depressed that I'm having trouble getting one. 😕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-13 00:26:12	Fingers hurt. A down side to getting warts frozen off. On the up side I didn't almost pass out because of the pain like the first time.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-13 01:30:54	Trying to figure out things involving electronic devices on my own never works in my favor. 😕😟
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-13 01:46:48	You know you're bored when you mindlessly scroll through Facebook and Twitter.......
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-13 23:42:08	Can I have a new back please? 😔
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-14 01:27:18	Was going to get my dad tickets to see @Phillips for Father's Day. But turns out he already has something to do that night. #dangit
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-13 02:15:47	To that point of boredom where I'm making dying whale noises....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-16 03:00:33	Spurs win!!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-15 00:40:28	Traveling makes me so sleepy. 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-15 00:42:29	Also bad service is annoying. Not as bad as I remember but still...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-18 18:22:33	Still worn out from traveling yesterday.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-17 22:38:06	Ready to be home.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-19 20:04:58	I'm 21 and watching Arthur. #iregretnothing
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-20 19:23:56	That freaky storm earlier.... 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-20 20:33:50	Momentarily thought I heard tornado sirens....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-19 18:34:28	Cloudy then sunny and back to cloudy. Make up your mind Ohio.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-21 00:18:52	Feeling hungry but up until dinner the thought of food made me feel kinda nauseated. So now I'm really freaking hungry. #ineedfood
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-19 13:26:09	Lookin like another rainy day today.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-21 13:29:12	Why is my room this chilly in the summer time?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-19 23:47:29	Argh...... 😑😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-21 13:34:20	For a smart phone my phone can be pretty dumb a lot of the time.  😜
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-21 13:51:32	Taking off an icy hot patch is like ripping off a giant band aid on your back. #ouch
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-24 01:05:44	Getting my wisdom teeth out tomorrow. Not excited at all. 😢😫
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-20 13:26:06	I've got that major bed head going on this morning. 😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-26 02:39:35	More discomfort/swelling today than I did yesterday. Still nothing to unbearable but still not fun. But was able to eat soft food today! 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-26 16:35:23	Wish I had the energy to do something at least semi productive today. I can only lay around the house not doing much for so long...
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-24 22:39:57	Whatever my mom made for dinner smells delicious. But of course I can't eat it. 👎 #wisdomteethprobs
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-27 01:27:16	I feel like I've been hit by a train. Worst I have felt since I got my wisdom teeth out (minus the first few hours). #blah 😩
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-25 02:18:03	I've had very little appetite today (yay nausea). But if could eat anything besides soft/liquids I would probably suddenly be starving.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-25 13:21:19	Well I survived day one of my wisdom teething being out. Nothing was actually as bad as I thought it would be!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-29 15:20:11	Jaw pain is the worst.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-27 13:26:10	Hoping I feel better today then I did yesterday.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-28 23:35:19	Thunder storm and I'm home alone. 😩😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-28 00:16:17	Finally getting a semi normal appetite back! Just stinks that I'm still limited to what I can eat.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-28 16:28:03	Swelling has gone down a lot! Yay!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-30 23:41:58	That awkward moment when you see a typo on a picture you posted several hoes ago and you can't delete it because people already liked it. 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-30 15:40:18	First cup of coffee in a week! 👍☕️
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-30 15:52:59	I feel a cleaning spree coming on today.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-30 17:13:16	Apartment researching. #funstuff
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-30 17:43:27	No more chipmunk checks! Yay! 😁 http://t.co/sPydXk158S
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-01 22:19:00	Well then.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-29 20:30:07	Reached my breaking point. I haven't been up to doing much since my surgery but now that I'm feeling better I can't stand sitting around. 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-06-30 19:19:29	Sigh.... 😑
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-03 01:46:18	Yay for new laptop! 😃
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-02 13:31:28	Brain says get up but body says no.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-04 16:39:47	Loving the weather!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-03 15:27:32	Perfect weather today. As long as it doesn't rain again.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-03 18:46:09	And it's cloudy again. #boo 👎
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-03 20:27:27	Why is it so chilly today? It's July.... #OhioWeather
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-06 20:42:10	I turn on lights because it's cloudy. Then shortly after the sun decides it wants to come back out.... 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-07 00:56:07	Everything is riding my last nerve today... #annoyed 😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-09 02:02:54	How to buy college text books:
1. Find all books needed
2. Add up total price
3. Cry
4. Buy anyway because you need them
#collegeproblems 😔
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-09 14:35:51	I don't need any more conformation emails for my order reminding me of how much I spent on text books. One was painful enough to look at. 👎😩
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-09 18:46:36	Guess it's time to be productive.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-11 22:37:04	iTunes is one giant pain....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-12 00:01:51	I am so beyond done with iTunes. #annoyed #iTunessucks 😡
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-10 14:14:54	Awkwardly liking something you didn't intend to and unliking it as fast as possible... 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-13 02:33:17	What a day. Long but good.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-10 19:45:32	Waiting to get a reply to an email you didn't really want to have to send in the first place.... 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-12 13:58:16	Sleepy... 😴
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-10 23:34:49	Those text books that require you to buy a binder to keep it together... #really
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-13 21:58:37	Bored. 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-15 00:53:30	Wise words from Full House. 👍
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-15 14:35:24	Loving this weather today!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-15 20:44:53	Where did the sun go?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-15 22:13:00	Why hello there back pain. You have not been missed. 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-16 00:29:00	You know you're a klutz when you trip over a blanket and almost do a face plant on the floor. Hahaha #mylife #strugglebus
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-14 15:35:34	Didn't set an alarm hoping to sleep in/wake up feeling refreshed. But waking up every 2-3 hours all night made that difficult. #stilltired 😴
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-16 21:38:11	Deciding what furniture and other stuff I need for my apartment makes me excited and stressed all at once. 😣😁
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-17 00:01:12	Back pain and slight jaw pain. Merp :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-16 20:56:51	Strange that it's this cool in July. But I'm not going to complain.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-17 01:17:04	I always start a load of laundry and then several hours later I remember to put it in the dryer.... 😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-14 23:19:04	In coming storm+ civil defense sirens= my anxiety going through the roof. :'(
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-17 01:51:32	When there's a bug crawling on the screen of your iPad and you almost drop it...... 😒😒😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-15 00:13:23	So much to do before I move. 😧

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-18 14:35:12	Yay for coffee.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-21 17:09:43	You know you're a klutz when you can trip up a flight of stairs....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-21 18:23:27	Cuddling with Snickers, and then she ditches me and goes over to my mom. #sadface 😕🐱
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-21 21:20:12	Kitty in a box. 😊🐱 http://t.co/BhQXnQR0Zy
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-21 23:44:40	Finally getting some kitty cuddle time.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-22 19:22:46	Snickers and Shadow playing together is one of the cutest things. 😀🐱
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-22 14:29:26	Shadow meows because he wants attention. Freaks out if you try to hold him. Then meows as soon as you put him down.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-22 23:37:31	Play time. http://t.co/hVULLY29XT
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-23 14:28:45	*yawns* #sleepy 💤💤
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-23 14:34:40	The kittens are really chill this morning.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-23 17:19:35	Snickers is sitting behind me and it sounds like there is a motor running next to my head.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-25 14:30:06	Awww. Five days ago they wouldn't go near each other and now this. 😀🐱 http://t.co/pSVCUCtgzt
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-26 23:51:17	Shadow just about pushed Snickers down the stairs... 😳

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-29 14:35:09	These cats are so energetic this morning. More than they normally are.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-30 15:48:16	Kitty's have been pretty chill this morning. Less rambunctious then yesterday.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-01 00:26:59	I think my mom is having a bit to much fun teasing the cats.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-07-31 20:26:18	One minute they're play fighting the next they're sleeping next to each other in the same chair. #cats 🐱
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-03 01:22:50	The places these cats get into sometimes.....

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-04 00:40:21	We've lost each cat at least once today. The places they can squeeze into amazes me sometimes....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-01 15:50:15	Lots left to do before I begin moving next weekend.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-04 19:24:13	Snickers has the cutest little kitty sneezes. 😊

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-05 22:00:49	Ummm.... Why would you want a red wedding dress?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-03 20:08:23	Problems of having a dark haired cat: Not being able to find him when he hides in dark places.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-07 15:32:38	Catching a cold a week before I travel to Texas for my best friend's weeding. Of course.. Hopefully will be better by then. 😷👎

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-08 15:02:16	So much left to do before tomorrow. Eek. 😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-08 18:12:28	Apparently it's national cat day. So happy Cat Day to these little kitties. 😀🐱 http://t.co/jgLsPIWtHW
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-12 01:48:05	We have plenty of cats toys yet Snickers and Shadow are perfectly content playing with a cloths pin on the kitchen floor. Haha. 😂🐱
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-12 14:29:56	Snickers likes to carry around this little ball that has a feather attached to it and it is the cutest thing when she does it!! ☺️🐱

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-25 01:09:14	It kills me when Snickers walks around my apartment meowing like she's looking for Shadow.  😭  Glad they'll see each other on Tuesday.

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-30 01:43:07	I suddenly really want smores.  Or fryo. Why must I crave things I can't easily have right now?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-30 01:59:04	I've had the same people come to my door three times today.  I don't  have your phone so go away.  Maybe you should keep better track of it.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-30 02:01:09	And it kind of makes me a bit freaked out that they keep coming back when I already said no twice.  Ignored them this time but still....  :/
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-08-30 03:08:39	Anxiety is up tonight...  😐😰

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-09-06 02:32:46	Finally I'm not dying because the AC is fixed and it's no longer 85 degrees in here.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-09-06 02:51:27	Snickers likes to attack my feet as I walk by.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-09-06 21:35:35	Yay Dayton one their first football game!  Sad I'm not there but I'm still a Flyer at heart!  #goflyers

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-09-08 15:35:15	I think my cat is on something this morning.  She's been running around like crazy since I woke up....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-09-09 11:33:56	I either get to my first class ridiculously early or in just barely enough time.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-09-13 01:35:35	Putting socks on cats.  I know it's kinda mean but it was perry hysterical.  😂😂😂

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-11-13 03:16:22	Spotting a spider in the shower.  Then screaming bloody murder when it almost falls on you.  😩 😢?

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-11-22 21:29:17	I'm either getting sick,  I'm stressed, or lunch isn't sitting well (probably lunch)  but either way I feel like I might puke.. 😭😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-11-22 22:03:45	Yay for crap drivers that almost cause accidents...  At least he had the decency to apologize.

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-11-30 02:11:25	Bad idea to look at good tweets.  #hungry
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-11-29 17:24:06	Pardon the language but Michigan's offense needs to get their shit together for this game.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-12-05 02:48:59	Accidentally falling asleep at 9pm.... Yeah bad idea 😖
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-12-05 03:27:49	Being so bored you find d yourself stairing at the ceiling.....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-12-07 22:26:10	Study for finals or snuggle with my kitty and take a nap? Snuggle and nap it is! #finalsweek
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-12-07 02:34:20	Is the new trend for football jerseys a crop top or do they just not bother to ever pull it down?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-12-06 18:35:51	Yep I'm totally that person that just stole a spot from someone who was waiting for it.  Sorry about that.  Actually I'm not.  #imajerk
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-12-09 21:16:07	Glad that test is done.  Just not sure how I feel about it.  😐

55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-12-21 04:46:41	One minute I'm slap happy,  the next I feel like I could pass out.  😴
55453630	AprilKathleen	2014-12-29 16:35:23	You know you have a cat when you can't shower alone.  #catownerproblems 🐱
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-03 16:01:54	And so the struggles begin. #srugglebus
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-03 16:23:39	"And the lights will flicker on and off." Seriously stop....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-03 18:40:30	People become serious a-holes when they're driving in the rain. 😠😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-05 22:57:36	Why do College texts books cost so much?  😩😣 #collegeproblems
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-06 05:35:43	@catsofinstagram Snickers (on the bottom) and Shadow (on top)  are best friends.  They love wresting with each other. http://t.co/UVMmLZRA9t
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-07 16:51:35	After last night everytime I hear anything that sounds like a knock I freak out a little
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-08 06:33:16	No. Just no. 😐😩 #babyitscoldoutside http://t.co/X9WisNCh1Q
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-09 02:51:42	When the cat scratches you and it still burns several hours later. 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-10 06:08:27	This cat better settle down and not keep me up half the night again. 😠😳
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-10 16:21:25	Feel like death 😐
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-10 03:39:29	My sweet baby girl napping. 😍😘😺💜 #cat #adorable http://t.co/mtkQZvFCix
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-13 14:04:20	Having a panic attack because you can't find the cat... 😳😩
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-13 16:52:47	So this makes two classes I am forced to learn how to use a mac...  😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-13 16:56:50	That moment when you actually know somebody in your class.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-13 21:01:05	My apartment is either really hot or really cold. No in between... 😑
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-13 22:13:44	Trying to take a nap because I'm bored and it's not working... 😐
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-14 18:36:29	I can finally breathe through my nose!!
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-15 17:15:26	Why do I even buy my cat toys?  She seems perfectly fine entertaining her self with things that aren't toys. #catownerproblems
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-16 15:59:08	The struggle of trying to snuggle with my cat.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-15 19:02:43	Go to the store and top thing on list is coffee. Do shopping and get home before you realize you forgot coffee. 😑
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-19 02:12:33	I think it's time for a new dresser when the bottom of a draw falls out when putting clothes away.  😑
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-19 17:24:14	Over the last few days I have grown a strong hatred for taking abstract photos.......
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-25 20:27:15	When the cat tries to walk across your keyboard when you're doing homework. 😑 #catownerproblems
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-25 21:31:08	Heats on, I'm under two blankets, and yet I'm still freezing....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-26 02:47:45	Made my cat a twitter account. Go follow @Queen_Snickers! 😀😺
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-24 18:46:21	That agonizing moment when you have to pee and the bathroom is out of order. 😣😫
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-25 02:13:50	Glad to see that the Womens and Mens teams both won today!  No matter where I go I will forever and always be a flyer! #GoDaytonFlyers
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-26 17:10:31	I hate people..... 😠😣😐
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-01-26 17:19:49	I hate driving in the snow. Especially when cities suck at clearing roads. 😣😠
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-02-01 21:26:42	Thanks AT&amp;T. Because you don't have the Hallmark channel I can't watch the kitten bowl. 😩 😢?
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-02-01 23:31:59	And it begins. #GoPats #SuperBowlXLIX
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-02-08 21:46:14	2.5-3 hours later and I'm done with all homework for today. 😐
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-02-11 17:57:36	Watching the Child Genius and realizing kids 10+ years younger than you are smarter than you.  😐
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-02-16 20:36:02	Zero motivation to do homework today. 😐😩
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-02-23 19:45:23	Finishing a paper then collapsing on the ground... 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-02-23 21:38:58	It's a constant battle with the temperature in my apartment. And with this cold weather is almost always freezing. 😣
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-02-23 22:05:25	Waiting for an email from an instructor only to realize you actually got in 6 hours ago but didn't realize it.  Sigh....
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-02-23 23:38:49	The amount of time I have drooped/nicked things over today could possibly be a new world record. #thestruggle
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-02-26 04:18:02	People from my section from marching band last year have deleted me on FB. Did leaving make them hate me? It sucks but oh well, that's life.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-02-26 15:18:15	@flymbal12 I know you don't!!  I miss you too!  💜💜
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-03-02 22:35:54	The fact that I have a 100% in my Intro to Computer Design class amazes me. I really thought this class would be a struggle.  👍😀
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-03-09 23:53:58	I feel and probably look like I've been hit by a truck. I'm so tired. 😐
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-03-09 21:31:00	It's nice to go outside and not feel like I'm going to freeze to death.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-03-11 19:20:28	I think someone loves not having the cone of shame anymore.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-03-13 15:03:20	Go crazy or go home!!  @FlyerPepBand on the Today show this morning. #GoDaytonFlyers http://t.co/pY3iNgDskK

55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-03-20 16:02:36	Why must I have a cold the day of the game? 😩😐😕
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-03-23 23:04:43	I wish food could just appear. I feel like crap and have no energy to make something for dinner.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-03-25 23:05:44	Chinese food for dinner. 😋
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-03-27 15:09:23	And it's snowing. 😩
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-03-31 16:43:42	It's 12:43 and class starts at 12 and we are still sitting waiting to start.
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-04-01 04:55:52	When the pillow you're using is flat but you can't switch with the other one because the cat is laying on it. 😑 #catownerproblems
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-04-06 13:23:55	When the cat decides to be rambunctious at 6am and you can't sleep and have to be up for a morning class in two hours. 😑😒
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-04-06 13:24:55	Waking up to find out your charger doesn't work anymore so your phone didn't charge. 😑
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-04-25 21:33:05	It's prom time! Brings back so many memories... Oh wait I neve went to prom! #iregretnothing Well mostly. ✌
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-04-26 03:24:50	Projects. Tests. Stress. Tears. No sleep. The end of the semester is near. #finals

55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-05-04 17:14:29	Oh thank you Lord I got a 98 on my final paper for my Marketing class!!! 😁🙌👍 #finalsweek #almostdone
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-05-17 05:25:04	Me: I saw a bunch of goslings this afternoon. 
@Truby_Brian: Was Ryan with them? #RyanGosling #punny
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-05-30 05:19:21	When you're neighbor is doing landry at 1:15am while you're trying to sleep and the noise through the wall keeps you awake. 😑 #apartmentlife
55453630	AprilKathleen	2015-06-07 00:20:22	When you're out shooting and get attacked by birds. #photographerproblems
