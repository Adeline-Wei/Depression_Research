558654135	dugalira	2012-10-18 17:28:22	@vikasbajaj @dugalira true. Let's see how the Indian hotels stock responds to that offer though.
558654135	dugalira	2012-10-21 06:15:54	@rajivanand @Zite  Given these views, I suspect Raghuram rajan will avoid putting pressure on the RBI  (Atleast from his end)
558654135	dugalira	2012-10-21 07:26:10	@rajivanand @dugalira thats true.
558654135	dugalira	2012-10-29 10:17:21	Back at the #RBI - will they cut rates? Technically they shouldn't with inflation above 7%.. but rate cut can't be ruled out.
558654135	dugalira	2012-10-29 10:18:50	#chidambaram's fiscal consolidation message a day ahead of RBI policy. Is he sending a message to the Gov? Possibly!
558654135	dugalira	2012-10-29 11:51:16	@mosesharding agreed sir. And today's Macro document is finely balanced so could easily go either way
558654135	dugalira	2012-10-30 11:58:58	At the end of the day at #RBI - the basic take is that the RBI did the right thing and stayed true to it's inflation fighting dharma.
558654135	dugalira	2012-10-30 12:59:20	@mosesharding FMs comments were caustic but I still think the RBI did the right thing sir..not for mkts but for Economy!
558654135	dugalira	2012-10-30 13:00:35	@BANCON2012 I agree. Can't allow 7% inflation to become the norm. RBI has to keep the focus there for now

558654135	dugalira	2012-11-02 04:07:56	@fereous @dugalira thanks! Yes I agree. Actually CRR is near historically low Levels...and that may not be a good thing?
558654135	dugalira	2012-11-07 06:38:53	The victory song: Signed, Sealed, Delivered! Good choice!
558654135	dugalira	2012-11-02 10:38:16	@QuantArt @fereous but imagine how inflation could surge if rates are brought down. thats what RBI is worried about
558654135	dugalira	2012-11-02 10:39:29	@QuantArt @fereous Well its not clear whether investment is down because of rates or because of the other bottlenecks at the govt end.
558654135	dugalira	2012-10-31 04:39:04	@thesuniljain the RBI gov seems to be guided by "real rates" again. Is making the point in all interactions. Hence cut was tough to justify
558654135	dugalira	2012-10-31 04:42:33	@shailichopra completely agree! He has stood his ground and that bodes well for the rbi's credibility
558654135	dugalira	2012-10-31 04:44:34	@fereous @mosesharding exactly! Deputy gov clearly said inflation can spiral higher if RBI moves away from anti inflationary stance
558654135	dugalira	2012-10-31 04:45:02	@fereous @mosesharding and that's a justified concern

558654135	dugalira	2012-11-30 08:37:37	India seems to have a classic goldilocks economy - not too hot, not too cold. Q2 GDP growth of 5.3% remains disappointing
558654135	dugalira	2012-11-30 08:39:29	Dr Rangarajan to NDTV - expect atleast 1% growth pick up in FY14. That will still be below trend
558654135	dugalira	2012-11-30 08:40:23	Dr Bimal Jalan to NDTV: Monetary policy needs to be pro growth right now. If directionally inflation is coming down, RBI should ease rates
558654135	dugalira	2012-11-26 10:02:56	@mosesharding that's true sir. Starting to look very uncomfortable again

558654135	dugalira	2012-11-22 09:23:44	@mosesharding that's true sir. Tough to understand why the govt doesn't give a more realistic estimate though..
558654135	dugalira	2012-11-22 09:46:23	@rajivanand haha very true! Unfortunately that seems to be the government's ONLY strategy!

558654135	dugalira	2012-11-27 04:16:10	@mosesharding Moody's was always the most positive sir. The real risk I think is from S&amp;p and I think that risk remains

558654135	dugalira	2012-12-01 09:58:54	Brilliant!  http://t.co/o5VvoUTl
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-03 10:41:42	@mosesharding true. If they adjust the medium term inflation goal, it should give more clarity on policy rates too.
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-03 10:47:33	Fitch maintains negative outlook on india. Sounds skeptical about india's ability to implement reforms

558654135	dugalira	2012-12-11 04:41:21	Is the banking bill going to be the next battle in parliament? Interesting debate expected today ..
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-11 04:42:55	FM introducing a provision to allow banks into commodity futures trading into the banking bill is strange. This is not a small/ side issue.
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-11 04:45:54	FM; RBI ok with move to allow banks into future trading. RBI has not made a public comment on this in a while but has opposed in past
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-11 04:54:44	@mosesharding I disagree on that sir. Needless element of risk for banks. And will lead to excessive  financialization of commodities.
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-11 05:17:42	@mosesharding I agree.. It is an interesting debate! Looking forward to parliament action today

558654135	dugalira	2012-12-13 03:19:48	#fed's move to link rates to an unemployment target along with inflation is truly historic. Interestingly no market reaction
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-13 03:21:32	Fed has made a bold move in giving itself targets. India too needs a debate on whether the RBI needs to set out clearer objectives
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-13 05:46:49	@mosesharding true. Toughest environment in a while and few easy solutions
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-17 05:42:37	Mid year eco review in parliament today and RBI policy tomorrow. Growth forecast may be cut in the former. Dont rule out rate cut tomorrow
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-17 08:16:49	@mosesharding think those are both best case scenario numbers sir. Reality could be slightly lower on growth, slightly higher on inflation
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-17 08:57:10	#Raghuram rajan always makes so much sense and puts things across so rationally. It's great to have him here as chief Eco advisor!
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-17 08:52:15	NDTV reports: govt to drop forwards market clause from banking bill. Bill likely to go through ... If parliament is allowed to function !

558654135	dugalira	2012-12-19 04:08:04	The banking bill has something for everyone. NBFCs gaining on hopes of a licences. Old pvt sector banks gaining on consolidation hopes.
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-19 10:51:15	@mosesharding 200 possible applicants?! hah! It's going to be q tough job for the RBI
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-19 04:14:21	For PSU banks too the banking bill gives more flexibility in capital raising
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-19 04:14:55	@mosesharding I suspect that will be a determinant in final licences being given out sir!
558654135	dugalira	2012-12-23 15:55:14	This govt just does not know how to

558654135	dugalira	2013-01-06 13:55:59	@Karthik_foodie @dugalira definition of HNI seems attached to net financial assets so would not include real estate, gold etc.
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-09 12:10:35	@rajivanand so apparently rating agencies remain relevant despite everyone questioning their credibility in the aftermath of the crisis!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-09 12:12:10	Decision to hike rail fares is an important one. Shows the govt is finding some courage from somewhere. Next stop - fuel prices
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-09 14:56:46	@rajivanand @dugalira That's true!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-10 03:35:46	@mosesharding agree sir! If the fare hike is followed by a diesel price hike - then kudos to FM!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-10 08:15:25	Cabinet briefing starts with lakes and rivers and afghan projects. Apparently we have no domestic problems to solve, issues to discuss!!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-16 03:52:50	RBI governor throws cold water on runaway hopes of steep rate cuts. Says inflation has fallen from the peak but still high!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-16 04:09:33	@shivithukral hah could be either but I suspect keeping runaway expectations in chk. Bond markets were over-stretching!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-16 04:09:58	@mosesharding I suspect that's why the comment was made sir!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-16 11:10:54	@mbahree @wsj wish they would just get on with it now. The number of times everyone has done this story!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-17 09:35:24	Diesel price "deregulation" / changes seems largely optical. FM admits it will make no difference to subsidies, then why is it being done?
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-21 14:47:02	Montek Singh ahluwalia on diesel pricing. Expects 45-50paise hikes / month, eliminating diesel subsidy in 18 months http://t.co/7FPyrn95
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-18 03:51:28	Runaway gains on oil stocks. The decision on taking bulk sales totally out of subsidy regime makes the crucial difference
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-18 04:23:48	@mosesharding sir are these levels sustainable or is this knee jerk reaction?!

558654135	dugalira	2013-01-25 16:04:46	@GulPanag @dugalira @sidpatankar fun fun evening indeed! (yes I am slow on twitter ..still!) and whoever suggested Serafina...great choice!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-27 03:24:26	Off to Hyderabad to interview Dr YV Reddy. One of the most interesting (and challenging) people to interview by far!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-27 05:13:03	@shivithukral will do for sure! He always remembers you and asks about you!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-27 05:26:56	@shivithukral haha yes part the reason for hyderabad is the paradise biryani! And now there is a counter at the airport apparently!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-30 04:57:09	#RBI: watch former governor YV Redfy discuss macro economic issues on NDTV profit at 10.30am, 1.30pm and 9.30pm.
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-30 11:15:00	@Areai51 @sidpatankar @prabhuferrari not yet. so far only for auto loans. But HDFC ltd (parent co) says home loan rates shd come down soon
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-28 05:35:16	#RBI decision awaited eagerly this week. Bankers poll suggests near consensus on 25bp cut.  Outside chance of a 50bp cut cited by a few
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-28 05:38:01	#RBI rate debate needs to account for not just growth &amp; inflation. The high current a/c deficit and low return to depositors are factor too
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-31 09:57:32	@svsrdy I don't we are facing a crisis yet.. Just some really tough problems!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-30 11:18:53	In conversation with Dr. YV Reddy, Former RBI Governor http://t.co/2UX5yuj5
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-29 03:13:07	@mosesharding your concerns resonated in the macro economic review sir!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-29 03:26:58	#RBI may surprise negatively today with no rate cut. Even if there is a rate cut, RBI guidance will dim hopes to dramatic rate cuts ahead
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-30 05:18:33	@navinsinghdalal hi. It will be uploaded on the net by the evening. Will tweet the link. Thanks!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-30 11:15:56	@sidpatankar @dugalira sid: lots of competition for auto loans..no bank wants to miss out!
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-30 11:51:25	@sidpatankar havent heard from other banks yet. IDBI has cut base rate so will benefit all loan segments. SBI likely to cut rates soon too
558654135	dugalira	2013-01-30 12:18:02	@mnshah6994 hasnt had much impact yet. Markets not sure whether more rate cuts will come through. Budget a more critical trigger

558654135	dugalira	2013-03-16 10:57:54	@shailichopra @lifetools very nice!
558654135	dugalira	2013-03-16 11:00:12	@GulPanag @karthik_foodie someday if we make it to Bangalore! Thanks for the invite!
558654135	dugalira	2013-03-21 13:06:44	@sidpatankar :( its all good!
558654135	dugalira	2013-04-04 14:32:41	Fascinating...and worrying
http://t.co/YbE8FeAPEG
558654135	dugalira	2013-05-21 18:16:02	@GulPanag @sidpatankar yes let's all do another catch up session, last time was so much fun!
558654135	dugalira	2013-05-31 05:31:31	Governor cools down market optimism over rate cuts. Market was getting ahead of itself http://t.co/yxkpZAxh7x

558654135	dugalira	2013-05-29 06:05:11	@mosesharding many thanks sir for your wishes and support
558654135	dugalira	2013-05-29 06:09:44	The rise in US yields is worth watching. Apart from the macro/market implications, it may have a bearing on External commercial borrowings
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-03 04:12:12	@mosesharding welcome back sir! Exciting markets await!
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-05 07:51:19	@aratisingh2000 lol! Love it!
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-07 08:40:54	#RBI doesn't seem to learn that saying anything on the rupee is a bad idea. Another round of selling because of Gov comments!
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-12 13:06:35	@sidpatankar @kunal_t @dugalira lol!! That's just too funny! I have to repost that!
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-11 06:37:06	#rupee falling fast towards 60/$. Seems like the RBI wants the rupee to settle at a lower level. No intervention and no panic reaction
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-11 06:51:26	@mosesharding seems like a well thought out strategy. Hopefully pressure from the govt won't start to build up
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-11 08:53:40	@chetan_bhagat why should they. It's a market. It's finding its levels based on fundamentals.  Comments do more damage than good sometimes
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-11 08:58:55	RBI blinks. Intervenes through dollar sales to prevent the rupee from falling below 59/$. That should give the falling rupee some support
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-11 09:05:54	@shaunkrish @mkk87 you won't get a confirmation since the RBI doesn't release it. Traders will give us a rough sense on quantity by EoD.
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-11 09:27:44	@shaunkrish @mkk87 you're right doesn't seem like a large intervention. But psu banks sold dollars at 58.95 kind of levels.
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-11 09:28:36	@mosesharding yes sir. RBI intervention and govt verbal intervention seems to be helping.
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-13 02:05:41	@sidpatankar  haha I'm a twitter novice as you are well aware!
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-13 07:48:30	@monikahalan and on a lighter note: as dr reddy says: why only target women buying imported gold? why not men buying imported cars! :)
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-14 06:41:03	@Karthik_foodie thank you!
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-13 12:17:47	@sandipsabharwal exactly!
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-13 12:18:35	@tonytongbram am sure the govt will gladly do that till all the rich industrialists complain!
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-20 04:51:32	@anandmahindra sir how worried are you about the change In fed policy and its impact on india and the rupee? Your thoughts would be valuable
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-20 08:01:22	Deepak Parekh to FE: the reaction today is largely being driven by speculators. Markets should calm down. fed not making any abrupt changes
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-20 08:03:11	Deepak Parekh to FE: rupee fall on account of domestic problems. Must find a way to draw in FII/FDI flows. Hot money exiting debt markets.
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-20 08:04:22	Bimal Jalan to FE: Our problems are domestic. Fed policy has no direct bearing on india. Focus on domestic issues
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-20 08:04:49	Bimal Jalan to FE: improve confidence in india as a way to draw in more capital
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-20 08:11:51	@mosesharding yes..although has some sanity returned to bond markets sir after initial panic?
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-20 14:09:50	@mnshah6994 7.38% on close today
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-26 09:30:47	RBI trying hard to defend 60 levels on the rupee. Rbi Intervention has picked up
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-26 09:49:07	@mosesharding yes sir looks like the headwinds were too strong for the RBI to defend. What's the next target you are watching sir?
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-24 06:50:38	@shailichopra stunning!
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-24 09:45:26	@shailichopra not bad so far! Lets catch up and exchange notes!
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-24 10:22:57	M&amp;M says it won't enter banking after all. After all the brouhaha over corporates in banking, we may not see many of them apply for licences
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-24 10:55:19	@boseudayan true sir. They will be very selective. But even before that the corporates / NBFCs are complaint guidelines are too tough.
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-24 10:59:55	@mosesharding very true sir. Think the fear is linked to impact on existing NBFC businesses which may be a valid concern perhaps
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-27 06:46:53	@shivithukral tell me about it. How many times and In many situations over the years have we heard that. Nothing ever changes though.
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-25 05:19:47	@rajivanand lol! The domino effect of bad roads!
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-28 04:51:49	A must read - the case for monetary tightening  http://t.co/elgnXesIuB
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-28 05:10:30	@sidpatankar sniff sniff I share the sadness :( but read in any case!! You and Your auto friends will not agree with the view though!!
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-28 05:11:13	@mosesharding I am sure a
Lot of people will differ sir but its an important view although an extreme one
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-28 07:36:11	@boseudayan That's true sir but I suspect that's one of the reasons he is urging tightening . What he doesn't address at all is growth..
558654135	dugalira	2013-06-28 07:37:21	@boseudayan couldn't agree more sir..that's the stuff that we just can't afford as an economy right now
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-05 04:44:48	Our desperation for dollars is showing! Why should the govt be commenting on HUL open offer and it's impact on rupee!
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-05 05:19:56	@MattJones2401 yes some extent of weakness is desirable and you're right that may be why they aren't intervening in a big way
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-05 05:20:52	@mosesharding absolutely sir. Their Communication strategies need an overhaul!
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-05 06:01:49	@boseudayan it's getting stranger by the minute sir and their desperation is sending the wrong message to the market.
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-05 06:14:35	@boseudayan it's intriguing why they are so reluctant to go in that direction. It's been discussed for so long but nothing happens
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-05 06:15:18	@boseudayan and now oil prices also rising thanks to Mid East tensions! Last thing we needed
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-08 04:16:42	Crude higher, rupee weaker: starting to look like the worst case scenario for us.
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-08 07:56:54	@mosesharding absolutely sir  .. It's a vicious circle and we don't seem to have a plan to break
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-08 07:57:50	@akshayjoshi yes we're just waiting to the prime minister to say "India's long term growth story is intact" :)
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-08 08:32:26	@boseudayan sir the cad in 2003-04 was a surplus of 2.3% of GDP. 2004-05 we had a deficit of 0.8% of GDP. Rupee/dollar exchange rate was 45
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-08 09:09:55	@boseudayan anytime sir. The data is stark and telling!
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-08 11:32:40	@boseudayan absolutely sir!
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-12 12:42:23	IIP contracts in may, CPI rises in June: looks dangerously like stagflation (even though policy makers hate that word)
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-12 12:47:14	India has lost nearly $9 billion in reserves in the last 3 weeks to protect rupee. About time we look for ways to ways to build reserves
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-15 15:57:14	RBI tightens domestic liquidity to tackle the rupee. LAF operations restricted, open market sales of govt bonds planned and MSF rate hiked!
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-15 15:59:32	First set of serious measures from the RBI to tackle the rupee. The question everyone will ask tomorrow - is a rate hike a real possibility?
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-15 16:10:03	@mosesharding absolutely!
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-15 16:10:29	@lv_1 lol! Good question!
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-15 16:18:17	@lv_1 that I do agree with. Having said that easy liquidity was being used to punt on the currency. To that extent this is not a bad idea
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-16 02:53:19	@lv_1 unlikely i would think
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-16 03:34:17	GDP downgrades, bank downgrades galore this morning. But I guess the good news is that the rupee has gained. You can't have it all!
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-16 05:20:48	@sanchopra20 guess its a trade off where financial stability is currently the prime objective
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-15 05:12:36	Surge of interesting deals - hostile takeover battle  for mangalore chem, kalindee rail. And now kohinoor sells stake at a huge premium
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-15 05:14:13	@mosesharding I hope we don't face a downgrade now! But S&amp;P has been eerily silent!
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-16 09:23:00	@mosesharding guess we'll have to see how the rupee plays out over the next few days.. Else this effort will be futile
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-17 05:19:02	@VetriSmv exactly! The RBI clearly didnt intend them to be temporary else would have said its adhoc. Govt seems to be doing damage control
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-17 05:19:55	@sidpatankar are you in bombay??
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-23 13:00:34	First the RBI backtracks on its gold import curbs and now they make changes to their liquidity measures! This is getting a bit embarrassing
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-24 04:31:31	@sriharij seems to be by default.
They appear to be adjusting policy as they go along
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-26 09:44:20	@sudhirtailang brilliant!
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-30 04:46:15	@MattJones2401 that's true..CPI is a more real indicator
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-30 04:37:21	The RBI has made it clear that the rupee is a policy priority. Even if they don't tighten today, the risk of tighter policy will remain
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-30 04:45:32	@visshy_it exactly! :)
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-31 07:28:00	Rupee headed towards an all time low close. RBI made a mistake in indicating a roll back of its measures this quickly.
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-30 04:38:54	While discussing interest rate differentials, RBI is referencing CPI. A subtle shift towards CPI becoming the primary inflation indicator?
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-30 05:00:29	@VetriSmv absolutely sir as long as they articulate the shift clearly rather than leave everyone guessing
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-31 14:31:11	@mosesharding congratulations sir!
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-30 08:15:57	@boseudayan yes sir as someone joked: we are a hopeful nation. We "hope" growth will pick up, we "hope"inflation/cad will fall but do little
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-31 07:29:53	RBI view against sovereign bonds is another negative for the rupee. Although that view seems like a valid one. RBI has always been reluctant
558654135	dugalira	2013-07-31 04:36:42	@soniabhaskar nice!
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-06 10:16:56	Raghuram rajan becomes RBI governor. On a day when the markets are down 500 points and the rupee is at record low.. A bit of good news!
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-14 07:27:18	The cash on apple's balance sheet can fund India's current account deficit nearly twice over!
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-14 14:26:54	And now the RBI is attacking dollar outflows. Curious to see whether this will be viewed as a first step towards capital controls?
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-14 16:53:49	@sanchopra20 I agree. They may not have restricted foreign capital outflows but the message is that such steps are not ruled out
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-14 08:10:24	@misaalmshah haha..maybe not apple in particular but he is going after luxury products!
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-14 16:53:00	@mosesharding that's a good point sir
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-15 06:45:24	@soniabhaskar that's ambitious! I would be happy with a free trip to Goa!
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-19 04:47:00	UBS: Disconnect between positioning on india (long) and view on india (bearish). At some point positions will wind down to reflect view
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-19 04:47:48	UBS: "rupee could move to 65 and even 70 can't be ruled out." Seems to headed in that direction
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-19 04:52:17	@mbahree time frame will depend on timing of qe pullback + what other half baked policies we come up with back home!
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-19 05:01:51	@mbahree may not be a one way move but that seems to be the direction for sure
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-19 05:04:06	@mbahree on a lighter note someone said to me in reference to the govt/ rupee.., "sometimes you just have to let it go" :)
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-19 05:06:13	@rhea_dh @mbahree true true I think everyone said 55-57 range for the rupee at the start of the year
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-19 05:06:36	@mbahree :) exactly
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-19 05:10:04	@mbahree @rhea_dh jumping on the bearish bandwagon I suspect
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-19 12:27:04	@mosesharding yet there seems to be little interest!
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-19 12:27:50	@mosesharding that sounds like a prudent strategy sir
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-16 04:57:40	Apart from all the domestic factors going against us, the rise in us yields isn't helping
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-16 04:54:28	Heavy selling on bonds, equities takes the rupee down to 62. Lets see what the govt/ RBI comes up with now
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-20 05:32:37	@shailichopra lol! I'm surprised Amul hasn't come up with something on the rupee
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-21 05:28:38	As we fret &amp; fume about the rupee, Krugman's take: what's all the fuss about?? http://t.co/1kClaBZWGV
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-21 06:36:40	@mbahree interesting...
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-28 04:41:47	Rupee has hit 68/$ - no other way of describing it apart from panic.
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-28 05:04:45	@mbahree sure looks like it
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-29 13:30:05	RBI gov takes a dig at FM as he leaves. Gotta love him for his sense of humor!!
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-29 13:32:24	Gov: hope FM will say"I am often frustrated by  RBI, so frustrated that want to go for a walk even if i WALK ALONE.But thank god RBI exists
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-29 13:36:36	@arungiri Arun you gotta read the speech. It's getting killed In paraphrasing!!
558654135	dugalira	2013-08-30 07:09:50	As the RBI gov said - you can't tell the market how to react. Experts and anchors need to understand that too. (Ref: PM speech)
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-02 05:18:34	This morning a whole host of fy14 GDP estimate downgrades to 4-4.5%. To all those who thought last year was the bottom - clearly not!
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-04 14:42:47	Atleast 13 new measures from the new RBI governor on day 1. Talk about making an entrance!!!
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-04 14:44:14	@VatsalaG thank you :)
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-03 04:21:47	@Nik_Inamdar nikhil on twitter! God help us all! :)
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-03 05:26:46	The pace at which news organizations are cutting staff / folding up, shows news is considered to be "discretionary spend" for media orgs
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-03 14:25:51	@rhea_dh why? Shouldn't it be bad news...
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-10 04:57:44	Power of sentiment - nifty up 500 points in 4 days. Sensex up 1400 points .Rupee up 6% from lows. Nothing has changed fundamentally
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-10 15:22:14	@mosesharding that's true sir
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-12 05:10:54	Verizon completes a $49 billion bond issue - wow! Wonder what the largest corporate bond issue in india has been...
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-17 09:34:04	@VetriSmv the govt certainly seems to follow this thought process!
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-16 05:01:04	@kaushikcbasu absolutely sir, less than 6 months ago..we thought anything below 60/$ is doomsday scenario!
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-19 16:19:43	So the Tata's will now have a airline, steel, auto, IT etc ..and also probably a bank. Sounds like a recipe for concentration risk
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-18 18:05:59	No tapering from the fed! Phew! Collective sigh of relief from the RBI?!
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-18 18:07:57	@AdityaBadami yup it's postponing the inevitable ...
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-20 03:46:21	Massive jam on the sealink early in the morning. Just what you need!
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-20 05:34:31	RBI hikes repo rate by 25bp! Cuts MSF rate by 75 Bp! Inflation concerns make a comeback!
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-20 05:48:34	As rajan said at his first press conference - not all of the measures we take will be popular with the markets. Can't say he didnt warn
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-19 14:46:54	Will aviation be the new "Corus" for the Tata group. Maybe / maybe not. But did they really need to take this risk right now?
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-23 04:53:17	@Manik_K not sure they would be right now
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-27 07:06:21	Bankers getting impatient with promoters. Equity should be hit before bank debt in restructuring: Puri of HDFC Bank http://t.co/UsNkehbT3h
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-30 04:30:26	@mbahree @bahree @lifehacks wow! Those look good!
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-30 04:32:20	@rhea_dh it was hideous to hear that kind of language
558654135	dugalira	2013-09-30 05:02:25	@boseudayan that's true sir! Maybe the business graduates should stick to management strategies rather than political strategies :)
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-02 16:08:21	@BobPisani just when emerging markets thought they had escaped the "taper" trouble coming from overseas!
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-03 08:55:03	@ForexLive what is the near term view on the dollar index ?
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-04 11:29:44	The RBI gets $5.6 bn in less than a month after announcing swap facilities! Wow! Power of smart ideas!
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-05 06:55:27	@VetriSmv @mosesharding uday Kotak is absolutely right  but as others  said - temporary fix was needed while a permanent fix is found
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-07 08:12:01	@VetriSmv a vicious cycle and strange that RBI didnt oppose it. Thought the mint editorial today was bang on
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-03 09:37:01	@Davindhanda @forexlive thanks!
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-04 13:21:02	@VetriSmv fair enough. Accretion may have been there if rbi wasn't supplying dollars to oil companies, perhaps?
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-07 14:36:30	RBI cuts MSF rate further but I suspect banks won't bring down their rates in response. Should provide some relief to the markets though..
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-07 14:37:52	RBI had said repo - MSF gap will be 100basis points. MSF has been brought  down to 9%. Will repo be taken up to 8% Over Time?
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-07 16:20:14	@sanchopra20 in one shot?! Hope not!
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-07 16:20:59	@mosesharding splitting the difference may be the most "neutral" option sir.
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-10 05:55:38	@mosesharding congrats sir!
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-10 07:16:37	IMF's lagarde to FE: india has not approached us for aid. Fund staff watching the situation. http://t.co/EdMwnJrqIN
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-10 11:58:33	@mosesharding that's true sir. Interesting development
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-08 05:27:44	@thisisrmb @mosesharding that's true!
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-09 11:22:37	Yellen is the new fed chair. Lagarde is IMF chief. And ofcourse every second Indian bank chief is a woman. Go girl power! :)
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-09 12:29:25	@pendown lol! What a pity indeed!
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-16 13:04:42	@rahulbiddappa haha I feel for them!
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-14 09:36:45	The rally in smaller banks is bizarre! If it was that easy for these banks to be acquired, the larger Indian banks would have done it by now
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-14 09:42:14	Most smaller banks rallying have fractured shareholding, making Acquisition Tough. Besides, foreign banks are not aggressively expanding
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-14 09:46:39	@visshy_it exactly! Besides they may not want to sell out either
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-14 14:29:18	@mosesharding exactly sir. My point simply was that acquisitions are not a given
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-14 16:35:34	@Me_Predictor couldn't agree more! Complete case of punting
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-14 16:36:23	@harisrasheed007 necessary but not easy in the case of banks...
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-18 09:00:49	Isn't this whole corporate india defense of KM Birla a bit OTT (over the top)...
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-18 09:43:00	China sees a pick up in growth. Chinese markets gain 0.75%, hk up 1% while Indian markets surge 2.5% - makes perfect sense (not!)
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-22 09:07:41	$ 9.6 billion in Inflows via the RBI's two swap facilities! That's more than what we would probably gotten through a sovereign bond!
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-27 15:34:19	@SreenivasanJain Certainly catches one's attention !
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-29 17:05:08	@Karthik_foodie thanks!
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-31 05:00:49	@Nik_Inamdar haha I haven't heard that one before! Love it!
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-30 18:10:05	@GulPanag @sidpatankar so fun to catch up as always!! Sid you should have been there! We'll do this again soon!
558654135	dugalira	2013-10-31 07:59:26	@Nik_Inamdar @rahulbiddappa apparently it's a term coined by unilever  - no less! God help us!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-06 09:20:22	Rupee worst performer in Asia today as debate on timing of QE tapering restarts. Shows the Indian currency remains vulnerable
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-06 09:24:04	Meantime bond market weakness, yield moving towards 8.80% interesting. Selling ahead of auction and coupon payment? Or rate expectations?
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-06 09:29:44	@sanchopra20 very true. Guess a realistic market based range will only be established once these special windows end...
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-06 09:55:36	@mosesharding ah i see ...guess it stabilises near these levels for now then
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-06 10:17:15	@mosesharding also lots of talk that oil demand is coming back into the market with psu banks buying dollars heavily today sir
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-06 10:25:18	@mosesharding that's true sir
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-06 11:16:59	@VetriSmv just checked the data.. You're right sir ., most have depreciated more or equally over the last 5 days..
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-06 11:17:39	@mosesharding hah that's true. Old habits of linking psu demand to oil demand!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-08 12:38:11	@thisisrmb true..guess its a no-win situation right now.
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-08 13:43:35	@sanchopra20 fair enough..tough to substantiate but that seems to be increasingly the impression....although your points is valid
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-08 13:55:21	@arijitbarman76 after chasing it for 5 years...they finally let go!!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-11 05:15:59	Bond yields across Asia spike. India 10-yr well above 9% China 10-year at 5-yr high, Korea, Taiwan all seeing spike in yields post US data.
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-08 12:27:42	The 10-year yield back at 9% (8.99%). Except this time it's not because of extra-ordinary measures, but rate/data expectations &amp; supplies
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-08 12:31:38	FII selling in debt has persisted. Suggests most of the FII inflows in debt was prop book money as opposed to long term investors
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-11 05:51:02	@mbahree @adamplow @davidkeo adjusting to oil demand coming back + another change in fed expectations.  Hopefully wont be a spiral lower
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-11 10:19:31	The RBI is now using cnbc to communicate with the market and talk up the rupee??! The central bank is becoming too reactive to markets!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-11 10:30:43	@mosesharding don't know but
Not sure it's a good idea for rbi to be doing this. Jalan/reddy/subbarao led RBI always maintained arms length
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-11 10:40:08	@mosesharding hah possibly but markets care about interest rates in turn!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-11 10:42:06	@MattJones2401 @mosesharding thats different. This is about being reactive to the market...which according to me has its downsides
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-09 15:34:54	"Bankers" on BBC: must watch series on the LIBOR scandal. Business tv the way it's meant to be done! Pleasure to watch!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-13 07:23:40	No massive -ve surprises in SBI Q2 - 1st quarter under new CMD. Thankfully no kitchen sinking like when Chaudhuri took over from Bhatt
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-13 08:03:02	@sanchopra20 haha thats probably true!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-13 08:46:42	ING survey shows parents nowadays give pocket money based on achievements!! I'm really glad parents of my generation never thought of that!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-13 10:12:08	@sunilbs_tweets thank you! I look forward too! :)
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-13 10:24:40	RBI finally announces liquidity injection through open market operations. Rs 8000 cr to be infused next week
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-13 10:25:57	RBI Gov to markets: Take a deep breath and examine the fundamentals :) Good advice in general!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-13 10:40:48	@MattJones2401 then he should be sending out that message to the govt rather than the markets!!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-13 10:50:25	@MattJones2401 true dat!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-14 07:03:15	@mostlyeconomics I couldn't agree more!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-18 08:42:24	@mbahree @visshy_it absolutely!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-14 17:16:28	@Nik_Inamdar As it should be! We have too many problems on our hands to be distracted by high profile but entirely unproductive visits
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-14 17:40:39	@Nik_Inamdar lol "scones &amp; cream, goblins and blyton" - love it!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-15 09:38:28	@Sherbir so nice to catch up!! :)
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-19 05:25:20	@FixedIncomeIN @INRBONDS @eyeofsiva not sure there has been any clear indication to that effect....
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-19 05:28:05	@rahulbiddappa what??????? NO!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-19 05:29:48	Shocked! sure they have other stars but cnbc without maria wont be the same! http://t.co/umc5JdFnLw
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-15 12:01:50	@KNVaidy a bit worrying to see the RBI move in that direction too...
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-19 08:45:08	@rhea_dh i know! can you imagine!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-19 08:46:00	@mosesharding @INRBONDS will be interesting to see what the coupon is....if its closer to 9% ...that'll be interesting
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-19 08:46:20	@mosesharding haha. very different league sir!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-19 08:49:31	@svkatti yup ratings have been dropping..of all business channels i guess
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-18 05:20:53	Kc Chakrabarty says we should move away from restructuring as it has led to evergreening. Can always depend on the DG for plainspeak!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-18 05:22:29	Kc Chakrabarty calls for independent monitoring of CDR cell. Banking secretary had proposed that too a few months back. May be needed now..
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-20 04:56:54	@thisisrmb @mosesharding @inrbonds end supply demand remains the same so I presume eventually even the new 10 yr will move towards 9%?
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-20 05:18:48	@thisisrmb @mosesharding @INRBONDS i tend to agree.
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-20 07:46:36	No credible numbers on extent of gold smuggling yet but have curbs just moved demand below the line?  http://t.co/u1wpEiFSqu
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-20 07:57:28	@thisisrmb true. So far the RBI gov said its not reflecting in the remittance data but it may be too early for a discernble trend to emerge
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-22 05:41:27	@rwac48 uncle that's so cute!

558654135	dugalira	2013-11-21 08:22:09	It was shocking that a MEDIA org thought they could get away with calling it an "internal matter" http://t.co/LRPDPkvGaM
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-20 09:33:03	@mosesharding :) yes sir..near impossible to get such numbers
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-21 08:27:40	@raju @ShomaChaudhury A media organisation calling something like this an "internal matter" and hoping it will go away is shocking.

558654135	dugalira	2013-11-21 10:01:09	Goldman's 12 month forecast for the Rupee is at 65/$ - lower than the 1 year forwards. Stronger exports, lower commodity prices to help

558654135	dugalira	2013-11-27 14:33:45	Not surprised to see Tata's withdraw banking application. Possibility of on-tap licences and differentiated licences could be one reason..
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-27 14:35:12	So after all that hue and cry over allowing corporates into banking...the biggest corporates (RIL, Tata, Mahindra) are not even interested!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-27 14:40:16	@rhea_dh haha good point! It seems counter-intuitive. too much regulation in banking i guess..

558654135	dugalira	2013-12-02 09:23:06	RBI raises $34 billion from swap windows at final count! probably the most successful foreign fund mop-up to date? RBI take a bow!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-02 09:24:04	RBI announces close of OMC swap window with the rupee at a 2 week high. All dollar demand back in the market since last week.
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-02 11:39:22	And now...unexpected release of Q2 CAD data from RBI -- CAD down to 1.2% of GDP. No monday blues at the central bank!
558654135	dugalira	2013-11-29 13:40:30	@john0709 @rhea_dh Haha that's very true!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-03 05:23:03	@thisisrmb Its silly..they really shouldnt be this hyper-reactive to the markets
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-03 05:28:16	@NagpalManoj and here we are hoping that foreign banks will subsidiarize and help in the financial inclusion agenda!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-03 06:20:53	@thisisrmb hardly anything. The rupee slipped some 30 paise from highs because of talk that OMCs will cover more than what they need.
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-04 05:20:57	@FixedIncomeIN @mosesharding will be interesting to see how they respond. Doubt they will be ok with call rates below repo rate for long..
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-01 07:22:31	@mojorojo Sour grapes? Or in this case..sour candy?!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-05 10:41:48	Ironic to see FII exuberance abt Modi, given that till recently US/UK (where many FIIs are domiciled) were not giving him a visa #justsayin
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-05 14:25:58	@lordludus @VetriSmv haha money doesnt always follow ideology i guess :)
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-05 14:26:46	@rhea_dh hah true dat!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-05 14:27:40	@SaanpaurSeedi yes..about a year back :)
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-06 11:41:13	Forex reserves surge $ 5 bn to $291 bn as on Nov 29! Strong swap inflows in the last couple of weeks, along with OMCs window wind-down
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-08 05:02:38	@Nik_Inamdar What an exciting election!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-08 05:39:12	@AbhinandanSekhr @arungiri What a great picture!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-08 05:43:27	@rukmini_shrini @arungiri I agree...great graphical representation on the ndtv site as always
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-08 05:36:21	@Nik_Inamdar Hahaha I couldn't agree more! I am missing watching this in a newsroom
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-08 10:03:16	WOW! What else can you say! "@ndtv: AAP has announced that Arvind has won by 22000 votes. LIVE updates here http://t.co/nEzpu1aS1D…"
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-10 05:24:19	NDF market is now 53% of all forex transactions in the rupee. But the share is much higher for other currencies http://t.co/8S8QUW8WDV
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-10 08:17:25	@mosesharding possibly sir. BIS doesnt give that break up
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-10 11:51:58	FII optimism around modi / bjp didnt just translate into equity buying. FII's also bought $207 mn in debt on Monday - highest since Sept 5
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-10 12:04:57	@mosesharding assuming these are long term investors and not punters!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-10 12:05:35	@ntdmagic i agree! this still doesnt look like the most durable of rallies (I could be wrong though)
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-10 12:15:21	@ntdmagic :) nice to know!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-11 10:20:54	@thisisrmb @IndiaToday friendly advice :)
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-11 13:20:02	@thisisrmb true
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-11 10:53:58	@Nik_Inamdar lol! too lazy to complete all the paperwork that the indian authorities would surely require!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-11 13:12:07	@visshy_it lol! exactly!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-12 13:37:26	@FixedIncomeIN @mosesharding in that case, my mistake. apologies
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-11 05:53:10	@sandipsabharwal bankers completely divided on whether this will help or hurt. Interesting to see what the RBI comes out with
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-11 05:59:26	@sandipsabharwal couldn't agree more!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-11 10:47:44	@Nik_Inamdar given ALL that has been happening here over the last few months and years...are you surprised??
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-11 11:14:25	@Nik_Inamdar lol yes! and since its a trip to mars, they may need 3 light years worth of tax returns! :D (i thought that was funny)
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-11 11:21:06	@Nik_Inamdar ROFL!!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-11 13:02:45	Raghuram Rajan: "RBI will mandate independent evaluation of large value restructuring cases" Opening a can of worms?
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-12 05:53:09	Rising tide lifts all. Stocks no one wanted to touch till a couple of months ago, up 40-80% in recent rally. http://t.co/n26N5NeaxP
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-12 05:59:39	@arjunparthasara not sure why they announced that. Call rates still below repo. So liquidity is not that stretched. In anticipation perhaps
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-12 06:29:12	So when does RBI jump in on this? Have virtual currency troubles (along with real currency troubles) hit them yet? http://t.co/DSTyId7dLI
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-12 12:11:42	@Davindhanda yea probably
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-12 12:23:16	@thisisrmb @mosesharding that's perhaps the only silver lining
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-12 16:32:04	@jhunjhunwala Lol! I wasn't born in 1978 kind sir! But even If I borrowed money before I was born, I promise to return it before die!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-12 06:45:52	@svkatti hah! you may be right. Honestly dont understand the issue well enough yet. the surge in value (and media attention!) is intriguing!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-12 12:02:41	11.24% Consumer Price Inflation! -1.8% IIP. Ouch!!!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-14 03:56:28	Happy 25th to NDTV @ndtv. By far one of the best organizations to work for and the best place of learn journalism! Miss everyone there!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-15 05:02:47	@sonaljosh wow! looking lovely Sonal!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-17 11:55:41	RBI on NPAs / Recovery: 3 sub-categories proposed Before account hits NPA. More than 60 day overdue accounts go to Joint Lenders Committee
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-17 11:58:07	RBI on NPA/Recovery: Onus seems to be on bankers to come up WiTh a quick recovery / restructuring plan. or else...accelerated provisioning!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-17 12:00:40	RBI on NPA/ Recovery: Equity holders should bear the first loss rather than debt holders. Greater pressure on equity holders
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-17 12:03:22	RBI on NPA/Recovery:  If new lender takes on 
large part of infrastructure loan and revises payment sched, wont be considered restructured
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-17 12:13:29	RBI on NPA/Recovery: stronger role for ARCs and distressed asset PE funds proposed..an area that has so far not picked up in india
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-17 12:17:43	@vednow haha! Yup this should have happened Atleast a year ago if not 2 years ago
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-17 12:18:22	@mosesharding true but Some of the infra NBFCs / private banks may have a role to play?
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-17 12:27:43	@MelissaFrakman Absolutely!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-19 03:31:35	Need for a wider probe into the FTIL saga: http://t.co/32TeuUm22C
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-22 06:28:23	@shailichopra hah! Nothing like a good scandal to inspire Amul!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-18 05:58:50	@thesuniljain wow! Think FE was pretty much the only paper arguing for no change! The vegetable price drop graphic today probably all imp!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-18 06:01:17	From FE this morning. Probably a factor in the decision not to hike rates http://t.co/pgzmehVyG0”
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-18 06:03:45	@FixedIncomeIN nope..out of town! Should have been there for this one!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-18 06:06:58	@FixedIncomeIN :) so what's the bond mkt reaction. Pause, but guidance of possible off cycle hike if inflation doesn't ease.Not comforting?
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-18 06:13:42	@shailichopra oh that's an imp comment!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-23 12:44:10	Strong demand for Indian dollar bonds probably bodes well for new issues http://t.co/4KOxKMFxw7
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-23 13:16:09	@AbhinandanSekhr @nprnews Fascinating!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-23 13:29:11	@AbhinandanSekhr Sounds interesting...will check it out for sure. Thanks!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-23 14:32:39	1/2 takeaways from RBI paper on NDF mkt: 1) in time of depreciation, NDF sets the trend for domestic markets. Justifies RBI's concerns
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-23 14:35:14	2/2 takeaways from RBI paper on NDF mkt: restrictions on domestimarket may lead to higher volumes in the NDF mkt. Hence counterproductive
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-24 11:01:05	@deepakshenoy what's interesting is that this is not reflecting in the remittances data yet. Maybe post FCNR scheme data will show
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-28 06:11:53	@GulPanag Love the return of the curls!

558654135	dugalira	2013-12-28 09:22:55	@GulPanag nice and relaxed! :)
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-26 13:50:00	@ZyFin Interesting to see this..
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-26 14:00:51	@ZyFin Tough to get that though isn't it? Hard to see where a consumption spurt would come from..
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-26 14:07:19	@mosesharding @Davindhanda @wideclops FII flows into equity and surprisingly debt have been strong this month and hence supportive?
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-26 14:17:40	With a few trading days still left for 2013, FII flows into equities are just short of $20 bn. Good for the kind if year the economy had
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-26 14:20:03	Interesting to see a nearly $1 bn inflow into debt in December. Are long term investors turning positive on Indian govt bonds again?
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-26 14:20:50	@ZyFin Will do!

558654135	dugalira	2013-12-30 11:58:33	@TusharChelsea Haha yes and I'm not sure who that observation is targeted at - the politicians or the voters?!
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-30 12:01:31	@ScrewedbyState True dat! No one is blame-free I guess
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-30 12:03:09	Food for thought: If you reduce corporate exposure limits at a time like this, how does the realignment play out? Do the new banks benefit?
558654135	dugalira	2013-12-27 16:14:45	@zerohedge There is no similarity between the India's policy on gold and bitcoins. The central bank's statement was justified and cautionary

558654135	dugalira	2014-01-02 05:45:00	@arungiri @BalakrishnanR oh yes I was totally joking!
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-02 14:31:49	@FixedIncomeIN agree. Call rates below repo again. What's behind the easy liquidity though? Weak credit growth? Fcnr money sloshing around?
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-02 14:35:22	@mosesharding why the weakness today though sir? PMI data or just heavy corporate demand?
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-02 14:39:32	@arungiri haha! I must agree with that :)
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-02 14:45:06	@sriharij @mosesharding possibly true sir

558654135	dugalira	2014-01-06 05:34:02	@thisisrmb if it comes from financiers as opposed to developers/ operators, it frees up capital at developer end to take on new projects

558654135	dugalira	2014-01-06 05:44:09	@thisisrmb Well if you view it as a zero sum game, then yes. But if you think about it as a cycle, then it perhaps keeps things moving ..no?
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-06 05:57:51	@thisisrmb Very good point. Dont have a counter point except that if assets move from weaker to stronger, allows for better implementation

558654135	dugalira	2014-01-15 04:11:36	2/2 deferring of weekly bond auction and perhaps coal India dividend also pushing yields lower along with softer inflation
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-15 04:17:55	So this means that the IMF quota reforms giving EMs more say are  stalled for now I guess? http://t.co/beZEV8BIuu
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-15 04:21:18	@MattJones2401 yes should be ..
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-15 04:34:50	@rumouranalyst @mosesharding too early to make that call in my view! just one inflation print. And Urjit Patel report could change things
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-15 11:01:16	@thisisrmb that's quite a turnaround!
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-17 05:24:40	@john0709 @rhea_dh yes that's a killer! I would be mad if that happened! :)

558654135	dugalira	2014-01-15 15:04:57	@thisisrmb that's probably true!
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-16 16:46:49	@rhea_dh Singaporeans have a reason to be unhappy?!! Oh ya, Ofcourse you have to wait 10 minutes for cabs on some days!
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-18 04:32:47	@thevirdas Seriously...bad news morning all around.
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-18 07:22:04	BBC news director on journalism today - it's a lifestyle not a job!
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-20 10:39:49	Now Maharashtra cuts power tariff by upto 20% (excluding Mumbai). The return of subsidy raj!
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-20 12:27:53	@VetriSmv And this is even before the last round of financial restructuring on power distribution companies is fully implemented!
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-20 14:53:29	@VetriSmv @sandipsabharwal come election season and they all behave irresponsibly. Some clearly worse than others though. Disappointing
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-21 05:16:17	FIIs debt inflows continue. Tally for Jan at nearly $2.8 bn. But as Mint reported most of it is in 3-month t-bills. Risk of volatility?
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-21 16:16:09	RBI proposes to adopt headline CPI as nominal anchor for monetary policy. Aims to bring CPI to 8% over 12 mths, 6% over 24 mths.
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-21 16:17:42	RBI proposes to set a CPI inflation target of 4% over the medium term, with a band of +/- 2 %
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-21 16:21:13	@visshy_it I know!
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-21 16:25:13	@visshy_it this is changing the game altogether, as opposed to just the goal posts!
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-21 17:19:29	@vineetmaloo tough to achieve though!
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-21 17:19:59	@mosesharding that scenario seems unlikely though sir!
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-24 02:27:36	Let the battle begin! FM challenges RBI's attempt to move towards inflation targeting http://t.co/9SoEuL2L7q
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-24 12:06:41	@MattJones2401 what has happened suddenly?
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-24 12:26:46	@MattJones2401 interesting. Thanks

558654135	dugalira	2014-01-26 04:58:12	@svkatti You're right...fascinating article. Thanks for passing it along.
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-25 10:21:42	Fact that India doesn't find a mention in edits on the latest emerging market meltdown, is encouraging. http://t.co/1yFFF6yEw4
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-25 10:31:04	@svkatti indeed. Maybe we are best of the worst! Just kidding
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-25 10:44:07	@thisisrmb true dat! Media attention is probably a lagging indicator in that sense :)
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-25 11:44:30	@thisisrmb those expecting appreciation are certainly being complacent in my humble opinion!
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-27 04:57:29	@thisisrmb @wideclops when they start making statements like that, you know there is trouble!
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-27 05:42:40	@svkatti hmm interesting. Barrage of negative news around Hsbc suddenly...
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-27 16:04:24	@shivithukral @anantgoenka One would assume that if it was recorded, they (congress) would have gone to great lengths to steal the tapes!

558654135	dugalira	2014-01-28 06:37:23	Govt may have issues with RBI moving to CPI based inflation targeting, but RBI's mind made up. Policy + macro review leaves no doubt.
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-28 06:39:33	Macro outlook for 2014-15: 5-6 % growth and 7.5-8.5% CPI. Hmm...hardly ideal but atleast better than 2013-14
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-28 06:48:57	Gold curbs accounted for 72% of the total decline in imports (July-dec): RBI. How, then, can the FM consider removing curbs by March?
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-28 07:16:26	RBI's urjit Patel on RBI stance: "we are neither hawks nor doves, we are owls. We remain vigilant while others are sleeping" brilliant!!!
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-28 08:08:51	@VetriSmv @pendown @FCLive haha good point! They better not translate that into Hindi!
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-28 08:09:55	@bhavinpgandhi core inflation is a part of headline inflation. Food and fuel (considered volatile) are taken out to arrive at core inflation
558654135	dugalira	2014-01-27 16:22:17	@VetriSmv lol! Must pass that along to the RBI tomorrow. Who needs interest rate hikes when women can be empowered to conquer inflation!

558654135	dugalira	2014-02-04 05:20:15	Confusing trends: stocks down, rupee steady, yields back at 8.70%. Rupee steady on RBI $ selling? Yields down on auction cancellation talk?
558654135	dugalira	2014-02-04 05:39:25	Looks like yields across the board are lower... http://t.co/s543y0Cykn
558654135	dugalira	2014-02-04 05:56:14	@Epicurused it should have been. Everyone was worried taper would mean higher rates. Maybe it's risk aversion due to the china factor..
558654135	dugalira	2014-02-05 10:26:15	Yield curve inversion steepens: 91 day t-bills cut off yield at 8.98% while 10-year bond yield at 8.70%.
558654135	dugalira	2014-02-05 10:37:28	@MattJones2401 that's the question!

558654135	dugalira	2014-02-05 10:48:41	@mosesharding @MattJones2401 ah I see..that's true
558654135	dugalira	2014-02-05 11:22:05	@mosesharding got it sir. Thank you!
558654135	dugalira	2014-02-07 06:15:11	@MattJones2401 haha his basic point seemed to be - Rajan you're a really smart guy but we are going to ignore what you have to say!
558654135	dugalira	2014-02-10 19:04:48	@eyeofsiva That's true sir. Will do!
558654135	dugalira	2014-02-12 04:42:50	@mbahree @bahree @UberFacts haha this is useful...sooner or later someone will destroy another iPhone!

558654135	dugalira	2014-02-12 13:52:22	@svkatti hah! Yes quite possibly
558654135	dugalira	2014-02-11 05:12:26	Aside to the main story: it's interesting that "currency strategists" are now giving quotes on bitcoins http://t.co/TYHM7gdaRu
558654135	dugalira	2014-02-11 05:33:34	@Epicurused yes and clearly not enough volatility to benefit from the in the major pairs these days!! (Sarcasm intended :) )

558654135	dugalira	2014-02-17 07:10:06	@FixedIncomeIN @eyeofsiva numbers look good but not much of a reaction from the bond markets. Why?
558654135	dugalira	2014-02-17 07:15:02	@eyeofsiva ah ok. Thanks sir
558654135	dugalira	2014-02-17 07:47:54	@FixedIncomeIN @eyeofsiva no belief in the RBI's ability to bring down inflation? :)
558654135	dugalira	2014-02-17 08:21:58	@eyeofsiva @FixedIncomeIN that's true. Guess they are working with the urjit Patel comm numbers

558654135	dugalira	2014-04-24 05:12:28	@bctbalaji that's true but atleast Idfc has independent licence permission...
558654135	dugalira	2014-04-24 05:27:51	@keshav555 5% is restriction without approval. Beyond 5% you need rbi approval but the RBI can choose to approve.

558654135	dugalira	2014-11-28 05:00:46	@boseudayan That seems to be emerging as the consensus theory sir! (from whatever we're reading)
558654135	dugalira	2014-11-28 05:11:47	@sumeetkhanna hmm....that wouldn't make sense....
558654135	dugalira	2014-11-28 05:54:46	@sumeetkhanna Its possible. If the market is playing on expectations of lower rates next year, then yes.

558654135	dugalira	2014-12-12 06:11:16	Raghuram Rajan: Worth debating the need for institutions like an Independent Budget Office to ensure deficits stay in control
558654135	dugalira	2014-12-12 06:12:43	Raghuram Rajan: Volker” like disinflation not for India, but Urjit Patel glide path fits us well, ensuring moderate growth as we disinflate.
558654135	dugalira	2014-12-12 06:18:36	Raghuram Rajan: Role of regulator is not to boost sensex but to ensure underlying fundamentals are sound.
558654135	dugalira	2014-12-12 06:21:41	Raghuram Rajan: Domestic-demand-led growth is notoriously difficult to manage, and typically leads to excess.

558654135	dugalira	2014-12-15 09:02:38	@MattJones2401 yes very strange. Don't see a reason for such a sharp fall...
558654135	dugalira	2014-12-15 09:13:24	Rupee falls to 62.80/$. No evidence of heavy selling on bonds or equities. Is the currency market forecasting a early rate cut?

558654135	dugalira	2015-04-07 05:47:38	RBI says policy stance remains accommodative. Developments in sectoral prices, especially food, to be watched
558654135	dugalira	2015-04-07 05:49:41	Raghuram Rajan -- base rate doesn't come in the way when rates are raised. It only seems to stand in this way when rates are cut.
558654135	dugalira	2015-04-07 05:54:37	RBI to push banks towards looking at marginal cost of funds rather than average cost of funds for computing base rate changes
558654135	dugalira	2015-04-07 05:55:59	RBI - to open up the possibility for Indian corporates to issue rupee denominated bonds overseas. Important move
558654135	dugalira	2015-04-07 06:12:05	@gchikermane @monikahalan they are the masters of convenient wisdom!
558654135	dugalira	2015-04-07 10:23:46	Stock markets may have ended flat but bond markets have clearly not liked the tone of the RBI policy. Yields up at 7.79% from 7.72%.
558654135	dugalira	2015-04-07 13:11:27	@arvindbanta love it!
558654135	dugalira	2015-04-07 13:13:24	SBI cuts base lending rate by 15 basis points to 9.85%. Pressure tactics worked
558654135	dugalira	2015-04-08 07:52:05	Was the RBI right in pushing banks to cut rates? Is there excessive cooperation among Indian banks? My take. http://t.co/byyCjPcLz9
558654135	dugalira	2015-04-08 08:00:24	@pramit_b agreed! all questions that have gone undiscussed for too long!
558654135	dugalira	2015-04-07 14:47:44	SBI, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank finally cut rates, hours after they argued that their cost of funds is yet to come down. Intra-day volte-face!
558654135	dugalira	2015-04-07 14:50:47	@monikahalan @sandipsabharwal i agree!
558654135	dugalira	2015-04-07 14:52:09	@vineetmaloo certainly hope not!

558654135	dugalira	2015-04-09 09:07:28	The markets clearly think Moody's rating outlook upgrade is a yawn. Sensex/Nifty flat. Even the rupee has given up morning gains.
558654135	dugalira	2015-04-09 09:11:40	@DNMukherjee agree. besides not sure what the report says that is not already factored in. and its not a rating upgrade yet..
