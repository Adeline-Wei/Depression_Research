564548079	legallyange	2013-04-01 20:46:42	There are several reasons why @JCCarver is the best; today's evidence is the bringing of a healthy curry when I'm too busy working to cook

564548079	legallyange	2014-01-29 22:08:16	Aqua Running involves wearing something that resembles a fat suit - best is part you feel thin when you take it off #training

564548079	legallyange	2014-02-03 23:21:25	I think it's a bit unfair to stack a debate with one sided views when all of us have thought the same as @KTHopkins #bigbenefitsrow
