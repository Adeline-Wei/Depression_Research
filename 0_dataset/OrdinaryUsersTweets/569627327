569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-06-28 17:49:21	@Jack_Jachim @Peredsticks I feel like the Celtics got the better end of the deal with the draft picks
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-06-28 17:50:34	@Jack_Jachim @Peredsticks celtics are going to get amazing picks in that draft .

569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-06-28 17:55:21	@Jack_Jachim @Peredsticks ya but everything I hear says he wants at least 2 more years
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-06-28 17:57:31	@Jack_Jachim @Peredsticks they won 49 games without pierce and garnet they just need to not choke in the first round like they did this year

569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-10-11 00:50:01	@Jack_Jachim some TV's could do lime a split screen thing so you could watch both games at once i don't know if you know how to do that.

569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-10-22 00:50:01	@Jack_Jachim who else did this?
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-10-22 00:53:56	I bELIeve in eli!
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-10-22 02:39:09	You know this is an awful game when even the announcer says both these teams are just bad
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-10-27 19:20:03	Winnings great and all but it be nice if the giants scored a touchdown or 2...or 3
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-10-25 01:12:55	I really wish I had gotten into breaking bad before it ended
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-10-31 22:06:01	This is the time of year when I see a bunch of people who I didn't even know lived in my neighborhood

569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-11-10 18:04:23	...youre kidding right ?
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-11-10 18:09:55	@Jack_Jachim its an alternative uniform that they decided to wear this year.
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-11-10 18:10:20	That's probably the most pathetic start I've ever seen.
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-11-10 18:11:01	@Jack_Jachim I think they should just wear those. They're colors are blue and white and blue and grey so why do they have grey pants.
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-11-10 18:11:22	That's almost as bad as when eli threw an interception his first pass of the year
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-11-10 18:19:28	@Jack_Jachim white pants &gt; gray pants
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-11-10 21:30:39	Feels good to have this project done.

569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-11-21 03:00:39	@Jack_Jachim I havent even watched a single Celtics game this year. I've been too busy yelling at TV during nets games.
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-11-21 03:03:13	@Jack_Jachim the nets need a break. They have just been plagued with injuries.
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-11-21 03:21:09	@Jack_Jachim they basically are taking a break. Have you seen the nets play? Its like not they're not even trying.
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-11-21 03:24:50	@Jack_Jachim its not those two. They don't play with any urgency. And the third quarter!. They suck even more in the third
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-11-21 03:28:50	@Jack_Jachim I don't.  I want the nets to do good. I was so excited for this year. And after they beat the heat I was so happy. Now this!
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-11-21 03:32:09	@Jack_Jachim I can understand the first 3. But why the spurs?
569627327	Thomas_Altilio	2013-11-21 03:35:23	@Jack_Jachim @rjachim Haha. Now I get it.
