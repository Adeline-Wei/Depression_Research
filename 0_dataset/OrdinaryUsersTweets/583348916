583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2012-07-15 12:40:58	@OpenLabIdaho how did the Seej game with raising makers turn out?
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2012-07-15 12:49:41	@CymonsGames look, another spool holder on @thingiverse. I'm telling you it's an epidemic. http://t.co/3NpFPQ3N

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2012-07-21 12:59:04	How long before we see a desktop SLS printer? 10 years? 5? Is there one out there already?
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2012-07-21 13:34:04	I really enjoy the burbles my @makerbot makes when it's printing circles. It just sounds so happy and productive. doopdedoopdeboopdeboople

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2012-07-17 16:41:57	@ironface077 I hear you... coming from a VFX/gaming background designing for #3dprinting is a totally different animal. different shortcuts

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2012-07-17 19:10:59	@3D_Innovations disagree: NURBS didn't displace polys, nor did SubDs displace NURBS. Volumetrics are just another arrow in the quiver.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2012-07-19 20:50:16	@tburtonwood you should systematically capture everything at the Art Institute.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2012-07-20 01:27:44	@tblatt @nycresistor @makerbot what's the name of your #seej clan? Tweet pix if you got em!

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2012-07-20 13:01:56	Can anyone recommend plans for an open-source DIY laser-cutter? Need to cut some hobby plywood.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2012-07-20 19:56:51	@makerbot did you come up with any new rules at the @NYCResistor tournament last night? loved the pix, great to see people playing #seej
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2012-07-20 19:59:58	@omphteliba thin walled test object is most impressive.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2012-07-26 13:48:37	I don't know enough about caseless ammo to know whether that could be #3Dprint ed with current tech. Chemists? Gunsmiths? Any ideas?

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2012-07-27 18:16:26	@Build3dprinter @codyburke970 The AR15 is a legacy of traditional machine tools-- what kind of weapon designs will #3Dprinting enable?
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2012-07-26 23:16:09	@makerbotsupport is it possible to move print heads out of the way during a paused print and then return to printing? Would be handy.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2012-07-26 23:50:04	Just bought my tickets for Maker Faire Detroit! see you there.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-05-24 22:53:46	I challenge @botObjects to print a multicolor Beast Token. @Afinia_3DPrint has done one already. http://t.co/RiN0NTZTH2 #walkthewalk

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-05-24 23:30:57	@rplumley I think a @TeslaMotors type disruptor is 10 years away, with UAV taxi services. It'll give the big carriers a jolt.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-06-28 01:29:42	So what do you think? Allen wrench or hex wrench?
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-06-26 20:17:32	@DesignMakeTeach Got one! Thanks for the rec. Here's my first try with it. http://t.co/IlCGWsG26e
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-06-26 20:25:46	@DesignMakeTeach @filabot has a recycling program. You buy ABS from them, then ship back any failed prints with prepaid postage.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-13 18:29:50	@josephflaherty I think I might give this a shot, because the method I've been using clearly isn't working.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-15 17:07:17	The #Seej Starter Set somehow found its way to @defcad Way more dangerous than a #3dprinted gun. http://t.co/c4hD4udFq5
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-16 13:46:14	@alistardean Those blew my mind when they first came out.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-16 14:03:57	@alistardean I put my first digital portfolio on a Zip disk. I think I still have the files leapfrogged over several generations of media.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-18 01:28:24	I recommend Acid Trip on @playouya. It's somewhere between Tempest and Space Harrier.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-15 12:51:28	I'm flummoxed by the IT challenge of keeping a Terran-Martian Internet reasonably up-to-date, and I don't even work in IT.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-15 12:54:31	@MDunham3D I still think 3D printing is difficult, and I arguably know what I'm doing.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-15 13:49:29	@MDunham3D Agreed. I think the problem is that too many 3d printers are being marketed as production cars.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-15 13:57:28	@MDunham3D Yeah, the tone was a little why-isn't-this-an-iPhone-yet.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-15 14:00:20	I just realized that Syrio Forel escaped and became the first Dread Pirate Roberts. IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-15 14:21:01	@printrbot from where did you source the clear PLA that shipped w/ my Simple? It's the best I've ever used.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-18 14:23:16	@Maker_Pipe @ShopBot I'm pretty excited about these. I'm good with design but not so much with hand tools. Hoping it'll bridge the gap.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-22 14:07:04	@DCZia August should be outlawed.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-23 17:19:37	@DesignMakeTeach I have despised the Dancing Baby since @tudelft had the hottest Gopher server on the planet.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-22 17:11:49	#3dprinted Yoda heads are the Dancing Baby of 2013.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-24 18:01:40	@dansinker that's the unknown known in this scenario.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-23 23:59:54	@DesignMakeTeach That photo's pretty old. I think I used a CFL which made the backdrop have some color funk.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-23 11:53:18	Used the interwebs without @AdblockPlus for the first time in years. Holy smokes that's a painful experience.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-23 14:17:07	@AdblockPlus Usually I browse all buttoned-up, but this time it was after a fresh FF reinstall. Thanks for all the work you do.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-25 14:57:40	The only problem I have with @BreakingBad_AMC is that it's making all the other episodic content on @netflix seem less shiny.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-24 17:36:00	I think the big winner from this week's Makerbot Digitizer announcement was @Matterform_labs.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-24 18:07:39	@ironface077 @Matterform_labs that's my point. I'd never even heard of these guys until the Digitizer was announced and now I want one.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-24 18:54:31	Chore wars now has the children fighting over who gets to scrub the toilet. #win
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-22 17:09:50	@makerbot Does the Digitizer output quad or triangle meshes? The gnome STL on @thingiverse is triangulated.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-08-24 22:59:48	I swear wine bottles are getting smaller.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-09-05 14:17:42	@TCP1980 Nice prints! Why did you choose these in particular for a #firstprint over the many other items on @thingiverse?
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-09-05 14:26:20	@TCP1980 @HRP_palaces I'd love to see you scan some architectural details with @autodesk 123DCatch and put it up on @thingiverse.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-09-05 15:32:17	@formlabs Something food-grade and microwave-safe, please.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-09-04 22:07:55	On reflection, I'm a little disappointed that I didn't receive @makerbot Replicator #1337 last year.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-09-08 12:40:04	@chr1sa @DonDagen I knew if I procrastinated with my Arduino projects long enough they'd add wifi to the board.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-09-04 23:27:30	@HealthJoinIn I watched that @geico ad with the camel again. You?
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-09-09 16:47:25	@MakerBlock @Enlightx @tbuser ZOMG that's some win right there.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2013-09-09 17:22:30	@JimDodsonOslo @kieranlong @eversion I hope the WASD+mouse model doesn't become the de facto standard for voxel-based modeling in 2030.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2014-09-12 18:49:44	Need a favor from someone in the UK with a #3dprinter, buyer wants one of my small designs but shipping from the US would be crazy. DM me?

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2014-09-15 17:00:47	@BrianEnigma I don't think the game is the prize. Imagine if you could have bought Mickey Mouse in 1940. That's what MS is doing.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-02-12 21:22:05	@tbuser pretty much. Some combination of infill and interior support structures
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-02-12 21:40:45	@tbuser I've been experimenting with hollowing out some models manually. I'm trying to print as quickly as possible.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-02-12 21:41:13	@tbuser I wonder if the shells on the hollows save any time vs. infill though.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-02-13 01:03:27	@TheNewHobbyist @meshmixer @tbuser It is known.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-02-12 22:32:25	@tbuser There's the rub-- this model has a 5x5cm flat roof. Must apply brain juice to this problem.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-08 15:31:59	@scifri I'm really hoping the answer is "a cow."

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-10 17:03:10	@BrianEnigma @owens_bill I like this idea a lot. Let me think on it a bit and see what I can come up with.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-10 17:16:56	@BrianEnigma Maybe try uploading a bunch of screenshots into @Autodesk123D and see if you can reverse-engineer it with photogrammetry.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-09 09:53:26	Join the conversation about Dungeon Blocks over at @3DHubs! https://t.co/0vVD5fnwtD

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-09 13:59:49	TIL Ceres used to be categorized as a full-on planet. Thanks @scifri!
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-09 14:35:47	This morning I recycled a sci-fi novel instead of donating it to keep others from suffering through it as I did. That never happens.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-09 14:48:01	@schmarty Blackout by Connie Willis. I kept reading but it never got interesting. Which is odd, because Doomsday Book is so good.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-09 14:49:53	@schmarty Plus it won Hugo and Nebula awards. I must be a philistine or something.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-10 17:51:40	@katewong @sciam Why does my cat try to trip me on the stairs every. morning.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-09 21:03:20	25 feet of fish tape and a 16 foot USB camera just showed up at the door, so goodbye productivity.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-10 00:45:41	Someone just added me to a list: "skilled programmers." One can only assume this was done ironically.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-11 10:39:45	Yesterday "Capture the Flag IRL with 3D Printing" was the most-read post at Zheng3. Spring is definitely coming.  http://t.co/4ZiXClidsK
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-11 12:18:29	@BrianEnigma @owens_bill Check your emails for a backer update. Thanks for the idea!
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-11 14:42:26	Take ten seconds to comment why you wrote that throwaway python script, because you will need it again and it's impossible to decipher.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-11 23:43:44	@cintagliata it does, and it doesn't.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-11 23:46:17	@cintagliata seriously tho I recall reading about chloroplasts harnessing the quantum properties of photons for max efficiency. Cool stuff
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-11 23:49:11	@cintagliata xanthophyll is one of the most beautiful words in the English language.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-11 23:49:46	@cintagliata secondary pigments on the mud-facing leaves of aquatic plants are a source of wonder too

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-15 22:26:44	@BrianEnigma that chariot's a bear to print. Even on a fast machine like a @typeamachines series 1 it's like a day

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-15 13:48:26	@owens_bill I never realized that the DB walls and the bloxen walls tile pretty much exactly. I must be in a design rut.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-15 14:07:11	Once @iRobot makes a snowblower I'll drop my current one like a hot potato.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-03-17 01:01:32	@GreenlanternNT @kickstarter Thanks for the mention! We're oh so close to the 50% mark with 1/2 the funding period left!

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-10 11:42:21	Think less. Do more.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-10 13:28:47	OK, Uncle Sam, check's in the mail. Please buy pizza for everyone at @NASA_Dawn with it.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-10 13:56:24	Went looking for a wayward d20 and found a dead mouse. Fun morning with the carpet cleaner ahead of me.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-10 17:03:50	When a father doesn't eat the leftover jiaozi for lunch so his son can eat them later that's some serious reverse filial piety right there.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-15 10:29:10	There seems to be a disproportionate amount of coverage of 3d printing as it relates to shoes.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-15 21:01:44	Lost in all the kerfuffle about the Falcon 9 falling over on the barge is the fact that humans can now have espresso IN SPACE.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-18 15:20:55	I have two 3d printers running simultaneously and I feel like a Captain of Industry.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-17 12:59:02	Apparently I live under a rock because I'd never heard of @MarnieTheDog until @tldr covered her. Now I see her everywhere.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-19 18:22:19	@fabricatelab In my day, a 150-polygon character was a luxury. And I had an onion tied to my belt. Which was the style at the time.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-20 13:46:58	@zipLogix mobile CSS would be a good start: very difficult to use the desktop UI on a phone. Some buttons are almost inaccessible.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-20 02:34:27	Pao trudged forward and tried to keep an empty mind. The feet hurt less with blankness, and he'd have plenty of mental stimulation soon.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-23 13:32:07	@RichRap3D @loubie_3D Yep. I think having shoddy QC did more damage than losing the support of the Open Source community ever could.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-23 13:34:24	@RichRap3D @loubie_3D OTOH there are so many good printers near that price point losing an o/s geek's recommendation could've cost sales
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-22 14:59:50	@RichRap3D @loubie_3D How much pull do we as militant open-source engineering geeks really have against a $400M investment, though?
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-22 15:03:41	@RichRap3D @loubie_3D point is MB may have lost a lot of Open Source goodwill but I don't think that's the reason they're laying off staff.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-22 15:47:50	Kinda digging @Gastropodcast.

583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-22 16:30:18	@MattStultz have you ever tried printing on Plexiglas?
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-22 17:12:14	@MattStultz I'm trying to think of a surface that I can flex post-print to pop a bunch of models off at once.
583348916	Zheng3_Jim	2015-04-22 17:20:02	@MattStultz Glad somebody smarter than me has already done the engineering work on this.
