584405873	_AdamLynch_	2014-07-11 18:13:36	@KelOhhhBrien that's why it's a delayed "break out".

584405873	_AdamLynch_	2014-07-16 14:30:22	Having a dog is sorta like having a drunk roommate. They are always asking for your food and occasionally throwing up on everything you own.
584405873	_AdamLynch_	2014-07-14 22:20:53	Serious motivational decisions need to be made in the 20 seconds between Netflix episodes

584405873	_AdamLynch_	2014-07-24 13:54:32	There's no cool way to chase a bouncing ping pong ball
584405873	_AdamLynch_	2014-07-25 15:01:16	Whenever I get low on money I start thinking really irrational, like what if I hadn't spend that $10 in 2007?
584405873	_AdamLynch_	2014-07-26 16:00:37	Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes...square, circle, thin crust, thick crust, extra toppings.

584405873	_AdamLynch_	2014-10-21 15:24:56	Plot twist: sorority girl doesn't have the best little/big ever.
584405873	_AdamLynch_	2014-11-20 16:35:02	I asked the most beautiful girl in the world out 4 years ago. And last night I asked her to marry me! She said no both times.
584405873	_AdamLynch_	2014-12-11 04:46:11	Someone snapchat me a tree. I forgot what the world looks like outside this library.
584405873	_AdamLynch_	2015-01-06 00:08:04	GUESS WHO JUST GOT ENGAGED?! I don't know, not me. Probably someone from your high school who's too young.

584405873	_AdamLynch_	2015-01-27 15:30:40	I saw a guy take a bite of Kit Kat bar without breaking it apart first. Sir, we live in a society with rules, please adhere to them.

I guess you could say this group project is getting pretty serious
584405873	_AdamLynch_	2015-03-19 11:56:18	My diet this past week can best be described as "unsupervised child at a birthday party."
584405873	_AdamLynch_	2015-04-02 14:09:16	It's _____ birthday! Let me show them how much I care by posting photos where I look great and _____ is in the corner looking ratchet!

584405873	_AdamLynch_	2015-05-04 16:46:28	I'm sick of numbers defining me. My GPA, my ACT score, my weight, my 1st degree murder convictions, my grades. These things are not who I am
584405873	_AdamLynch_	2015-05-03 20:08:25	If I pass my last final I'm going to walk out of class, jump up into the air, kick my feet back, and freeze like the ending of a 90's sitcom
584405873	_AdamLynch_	2015-05-21 14:12:43	Applying for jobs like, "What experience do you have?" "Well I was a hall monitor in 3rd grade."

584405873	_AdamLynch_	2015-06-09 14:17:17	There's only one thing better than the cutest cat in the world...any dog.
584405873	_AdamLynch_	2015-06-16 13:27:01	I feel like ironing boards are surf boards that gave up their dreams and got real jobs.
