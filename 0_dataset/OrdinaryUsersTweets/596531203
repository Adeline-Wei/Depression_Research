596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2013-08-26 02:42:35	We finally talk and agree to be friends and an hour later you're bitching about me talking to someone else? Are you serious?
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2013-08-26 02:43:48	You have how many girls trying to be with you? I promise you'll be okay without me! 😂

596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2013-10-04 07:15:52	The fact that you ALWAYS come back is kinda getting old. You wanna leave, and go to another girl, stay gone. It's simple.

596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-01-18 19:26:02	@ryan_reel @kaitieeeb @_NightHawk69 @racleanne you need to refrain from talking shit to people.

596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-22 22:29:23	@lisaaa_nicoleee we really were. I would hate us too if I were her.
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-22 22:31:41	@lisaaa_nicoleee nothing but trouble. We were the kids the parents didn't want their kids to hang out with. 😂😂
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-24 19:52:40	@AlexisAnneT well. I'm just sitting at Dylan's alone so if you find some spare time you're welcome to swing on by.
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-24 19:57:39	@AlexisAnneT Dylan's at work. Shane Shane's at work. Nikki's at work. All I got is Echo. 😔 but I ain't complaining. No school🙌😂
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-24 19:58:46	Doing all dyls chores, and cleaning his nasty room for him while he's at work. I'm literally the best gf. Js.
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-24 20:04:06	@AlexisAnneT he doesn't care about me. Cookies around. 😐 hunter just lets her roam on over and corrupt my baby.
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-24 21:10:15	@AlexisAnneT he's refusing to let me go home so I guess so😐
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-25 02:47:02	IM NOT PREGNANT for anyone in oak grove who thinks otherwise. Just saying!
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-25 03:52:48	@AlexisAnneT I've had about 15 blocked calls tonight saying I was. Now they're calling Dylan. 😂

596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-25 03:55:18	@AlexisAnneT I will 😂 they don't want to talk to you!
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-24 22:32:50	@AlexisAnneT you will see me😊😊
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-25 05:40:50	My absolute favorite thing: when we're in the bed on opposite sides and you wrap your arm around me &amp; pull me to you. It just gets me. 😍😍
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-25 08:56:10	Thank you duck season for allowing Dylan to wake everyone in the house up at 2:30 am. 😩 can't deal.

596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-27 20:22:56	How hateful can you be..
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-30 05:51:32	Leaving it all in God's hands. Everything happens for a reason, it's as simple as that 💙
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-29 09:23:52	Dylan's bout to learn. That's all I'm saying.
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-30 23:38:28	Fake. That's all.
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-11-30 23:40:18	I wish my bby felt better. I don't like going weekends without your face. 😔 @AlexisAnneT
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-12-01 18:53:51	I spend too much money on Dylan 😐 my bank account is crying right now.
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-12-01 18:57:15	Can't even explain how excited I am that thursday is my last day of school until January 12th😍

596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-12-10 04:57:39	I love face timing with Rachel, Kaylon, &amp; Waylon😊 it's so good to be able to watch him grow up even when we can't see him everyday.
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-12-11 16:58:06	Nothing bothers me more than people doing so much for someone and never getting the favor returned. It's just wrong.
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-12-10 08:18:22	Echo has his days and nights confused. He has yet to go to sleep. 😞
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2014-12-12 03:45:08	@AlexisAnneT Uhm cause you didn't say anything to me about it!

596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2015-01-10 06:36:51	I'm just not the party drinking type. If that's a problem then I'll be on my way. 👌
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2015-01-09 13:20:25	It's 7:15, I have nothing to do til after 12, and Shane Shane has me up playing trivia crack. 😒😩
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2015-01-09 18:40:10	@AlexisAnneT @girlideas 😂😂 sounds like something we'd say to the cry baby boys.

596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2015-01-14 04:47:16	I may just drop out. Be a stay at home mom with echo. Sounds like 100 times better. But Dylan on that "you need an education" bullshit. 😒
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2015-01-14 04:48:56	I think I might would study better if I was just a little tipsy. I mean I do always zone in on peoples conversations so much better drunk.

596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2015-02-19 23:58:03	People have very odd ways of showing they care about you.
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2015-02-20 01:46:58	Some things just aren't forgivable.
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2015-02-20 01:48:31	I take a lot but when I've had enough I've really had enough.

596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2015-02-20 19:29:18	"Just bc you never came to school doesn't mean your brother doesn't need to come" oh. Ok. 👌
596531203	kaitlyn_layne96	2015-02-20 23:01:15	Feeling unwanted is the worst feeling in the world.
