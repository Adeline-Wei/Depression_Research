599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-04-16 19:11:15	Once again, in debt and proud. Thanks, Bennett #BBCDebate
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-04-16 19:17:41	Yes!! Sturgeon calling both Cameron and Miliband out in one breath. Brilliant #BBCDebate
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-04-16 19:21:01	If there's not a big enough difference between Cameron and Miliband then what's the alternative with current electoral system? #BBCDebate
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-04-16 19:34:02	HE DID!! MILIBAND LAUGHED AT NIGE #BBCDebate
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-04-16 19:34:21	Just a lil giggle over slagging the audience off #BBCDebate
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-04-16 19:34:53	'The real audience are at home' - lol Farage, you're not winning my vote  #BBCDebate
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-04-16 19:36:16	Sturgeon is so sassy and fierce. Also laughing at Farage  #BBCDebate
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-04-16 19:38:50	EdM is so much more relaxed without Cameron and Clegg there. Interesting to see what happens at the next debate with just those 3 #BBCDebate
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-04-16 20:18:51	Tory witch hunt. That's what they all came for. Cameron bashing. Little bit of Miliband jokes too #BBCDebate
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-04-16 20:23:18	Miliband is so down with the young voters. 1979 is back in fashion rn, ask Topshop #BBCDebate
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-04-16 20:29:50	'David, debate me and let the people decide' - Miliband's ultimatum is right out of a rubbish high school movie #BBCDebate
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-04-16 19:14:26	Can't wait for Miliband to outright laugh at Farage. It's going to happen  #BBCDebate

599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-03 13:02:12	@LifestyleLauren it's amazing! I'm 99% all the tickets have gone though. Absolutely amazing!
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:04:46	@DomFord_ (1) I disagree. In a democracy we have a duty to educate ourselves on politics. If u don't want 2 vote 4 anyone then spoil
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:05:49	@DomFord_ (2) the ballot. Better than not voting which fuels political disengagement and just shows apathy. Nothing is achieved.
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:10:42	@DomFord_ It shows they have turned up to express that they don't want to vote for any of the candidates. It shows they're engaged and care
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:11:28	@DomFord_ imo we have a right to protect &amp; honour our democracy - the main way to do this is by voting.
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:22:09	@DomFord_ We should have a None Of the Above box like Aus &amp; all have to vote in some way or be fined. How can a gov be elected with cont
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:23:09	@DomFord_ less than a 3rd of people turning out to vote. It's not legitimate. We are privileged in a democracy and need to honour that
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:24:17	@DomFord_ yes, political education should b increased to prevent ignorance but we have a duty to inform ourselves. there's the internet.
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:25:07	@DomFord_ politicians can only be held to account by those that vote so as many people need to vote as poss
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:31:48	@DomFord_ you sound like an approaches lecture with the philosophical theory. That's life. Say the same about a dictatorship. Fight that&amp;die
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:32:10	@DomFord_ (loving this debate btw) can you tell I'm bored?
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:33:28	@DomFord_ again, the only way to increase engagement is to get more involved &amp; hold MPs to account - then change and ^turnout can happen
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:38:30	@DomFord_ correct but that won't happen as its expensive and the main parties won't pass it as it will lose them seats
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:38:48	@DomFord_ stuck w this system now so have to make the most of it
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:40:43	@DomFord_ indeed. Neither result isn't really going to be the second coming either
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:45:40	@DomFord_ lol ukip
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-05-07 16:47:38	@DomFord_ Yes but I don't believe that changing the system is realistic. None of the big 3 want it. improving education&amp;turnout will do 4now

599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-06-03 19:42:37	@endingHomelessn to take all of her past achievements from her isn't something that I support. It is not supportive of trans rights at all.
599625140	MaddyParsley	2015-06-03 20:03:57	@endingHomelessn ha lol who are you to say that Jenner is profit off being trans? Seems like a v drastic lifestyle change just to make $$$
