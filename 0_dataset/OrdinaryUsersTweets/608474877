608474877	MercTingTing	2014-08-03 19:36:54	Just got back from watching Guardians of the Galaxy! Great movie! Star studded cast! 10/10 would watch again!
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-08-04 21:07:56	@nerohkun nah. Hearthstone is dope. You just need to pay to win or grind the fuck. But I'm talking about those Facebook type games.
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-08-04 21:08:09	@nerohkun like you need some amount of friends to get awesome shit.
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-08-04 21:09:45	@nerohkun that's good, but those games on the App Store that make you need friends and shit to get good stuff is stupid.
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-08-04 21:11:39	@nerohkun but I don't have any friends in the states who play! But with hearthstone I really don't have to worry since it's a compet. game.
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-08-04 21:12:14	@nerohkun most competitive games really to pay to win. So, I'm not to worried about that. Just some of the prices are insane.
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-08-04 22:46:57	Who wants to go on a date with me? :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-08-05 00:30:16	@nerohkun It's cause he's a scruberino and it's Colin. He's a dumb.
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-08-05 16:23:21	Soooo yeah... Hyrule Warriors looks fucking boss and I want a Wii U now...
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-08-05 16:26:22	If only saving someones life in a video game can mean something IRL. Like, "I owe you one." Or something haha. That'd be fun :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-08-05 16:28:29	I remember the days where I had to wake up at 830 AM for classes. Ha... I don't miss those days...

608474877	MercTingTing	2014-08-05 04:25:31	@PissedOffBiotic The show is great! Honestly, I think it's just Chris Pratt being himself in all his roles.

608474877	MercTingTing	2014-08-22 06:09:42	Well... not just one portal gun. More than one. One for each continent honestly.

608474877	MercTingTing	2014-08-22 06:12:03	Portal guns would make life and traveling so much easier. That also include crimes... but let's just give it to those without a criminal rec

608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-19 03:26:06	I think biting your own lip hurts more than your tongue. Well, probably not. But my lip hurts tho...
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-19 03:27:06	@TheMechromancer hey pretty little lady, how do you like Borderlands TPS?
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-19 03:30:51	@TheMechromancer The Antheny conversations are hiliarious! And I love it! A lot of reviewers are bashing on it, but I think its still a
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-19 03:31:14	@TheMechromancer great game! And a bunch of aussie accents too. Love it.
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-19 03:33:57	@TheMechromancer my favorite line from Janey to Athen is, "I think you're hot. Thought I should put that out there." Janey is so smooth!
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-19 03:34:17	@TheMechromancer Probably one of my new favorite NPCs for sure!
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-19 03:39:07	I love my new wrist band. Makes me look edgy! http://t.co/V6ItBmjFsi

608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-19 03:42:14	@TheMechromancer NEVAR! THINK OF ALL THE ATHENY BABIES THEY CAN MAKE!
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-19 03:47:03	@TheMechromancer AND WHOSE THE CAPTAIN OF THAT SHIP?! JANEY WITH HER FIRST SHIPMATE, ATHENA! WITH ATHENA HOLDING HER HIPS FROM BEHIND

608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-20 01:32:23	Reason why I don't talk during League games: Most of the time, the person I'm arguing with is a dumb cunt.

608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-20 07:45:55	@ceae B...because... I like to daily videos...
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-20 07:51:36	Huh... so Dignitas is no more? Sad. I liked everyone on their team. Probably the only team that I liked where I liked every member.

608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-20 08:05:30	@nhales80 I heard Scarra might coach TSM... don't know if he was joking, but that'd be weird... imo.
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-20 08:09:18	@nhales80 yeah... I find that weird... SCARRA IS HOMELESS! ha. Still, I want these contracts to settle now so I know who to root for.
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-20 08:11:51	@nhales80 I thought they did well during LCS... Let's just hope everyone gets drafted into good teams!
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-20 08:14:19	@nhales80 ofc The Prophet will be fine! Before every game, he can tell his team if they will win or lose! Great addition to any team!
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-20 08:15:03	@nhales80 and QT and Kiwi will have a hard time. I feel like they woukd be subs.

608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-20 17:55:21	@ceae yeah! Like over the ear hole, meh... doesn't do the trick. Ear buds, people will be rood and pull them out. Over the ear, OP.
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-20 20:00:35	Can't wait to get home and be lazy... I hate wearing khaki's.... do I look like a rich boy from Bel-Air?

608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-23 00:45:18	@PerfectChaos_x True dat girlfrand also, they are a bunch of butts too. Infinity Ward was their best company to work with. MW series = bes.
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-23 00:47:26	@PerfectChaos_x BO2 was probably my favorite Treyarch game. Ghosts was true shit. But at least you have BO2. Something decent haha.

608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-23 01:38:20	@PerfectChaos_x I WAS RIGHT! I'M A GENIE! Probably tried to hide from Activision before they kill it.
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-10-23 01:43:28	@PerfectChaos_x Yeah, that's what I thought when I saw the trailer. Soldiers jumping with jet packs and shit. Been there, seen that :P

608474877	MercTingTing	2014-11-29 17:12:04	It's weird meeting new people that don't have anything in common with you. I have to open the "causal topics" folder in my head.
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-11-29 17:12:50	For example: "How about that local sports team?" "This weather, huh?" "You watch movies?" "Beer?"
608474877	MercTingTing	2014-11-29 17:13:45	Last night, I was surrounded by new people, but they were all gamers and/or otaku. THEY KNEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN I OPENED MY MOUTH

608474877	MercTingTing	2014-12-06 00:58:48	The phrase "Let it go" cannot be used without being reminded of the song from Frozen. I blame YOU specifically from making this so! YOU!

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-09 07:36:00	I miss making YouTube content :c
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-09 07:36:30	If anything, I miss editing. That was probably the best thing to come from all of it.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-09 07:37:26	Those late editing nights with a couple of drinks. Ahh... good times...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-09 07:38:20	...I want EDI back... yes, I gave her a name...

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-09 07:40:49	Due to my fucked up sleeping schedule, I think it's time for late night doodles on my phone :3
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-09 08:48:56	@TheMechromancer ahh... forgot I was still watching that... thanks for the reminder.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-09 08:59:33	Man... I wish I had an eye color that didn't fit me. Like sky blue or green. Imagine all the chicks I still won't get! Man... the life.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-09 08:50:26	I need to find my talent. I'm pretty sure it's in gaming... cause I suck at drawing and painting. I can use photoshop... but that's about it
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-09 15:57:39	@SkittlesCanFly_ why am I friends with you again?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-09 15:59:44	@SkittlesCanFly_ love is a strong word. Maybe... uh... kinda not hate you. That's better.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-09 16:02:54	@SkittlesCanFly_ .... Nope. Hue.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-11 06:20:23	Even tho, most of her characters are some bad ass chicks with an awesomeness aura.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-11 06:22:29	Glad that I'm back on tumblr. Gives me a reason to surf the net harder.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-11 10:34:50	Man... #LeagueofLegends tonight was filled with a bunch of selfish people... we won in the end, but... damn... @ceae

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-13 02:42:30	@nerohkun I was so confused when I looked and saw you only had one post haha
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-13 02:45:17	@nerohkun I skimmed through it. And you fucking would post something on your old tumblr about it. Hue. Looks professional at least.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-13 02:46:15	@nerohkun no problem. Are you going to be review more?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-13 02:51:56	@nerohkun I see. Good luck with that. Do what you do.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-13 08:39:16	I don't make one so I don't disappoint myself :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-13 03:39:20	Always been on the fence on dying my hair a unnatural color. But, my hair is so dark I would have to bleach it and shit and nah. 2 much work
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-13 03:40:07	Well, not really, but I would look weird as a blonde for a while... or with reddish hair, which i want.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-13 03:40:43	Not ginger red, like a dark red. A more red auburn color? I dunno...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-13 03:46:21	@BackupFruit love you too dad. Miss you bunches.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-14 02:56:29	@ceae I think we need one more person to do so. I'm pretty sure Cykatic is in.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-14 03:27:09	@ceae uhhhhhh.... you have more friends than I do... so... yeh...

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-13 19:30:53	Why is Starbucks the place to do work? Most of the time it's loud. Is it because you're sitting around the smell of coffee to be productive?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-13 19:35:44	My two loves http://t.co/kJd5ePZMr7

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-16 06:54:47	@PissedOffBiotic what you need to do is get to PAX East! He's gonna be there again this year. That's where i met him :D

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-16 07:00:52	@PissedOffBiotic i would've asked for a picture, but due to the amount of people that came to the table he was at, we couldn't... bastards..
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-16 07:01:19	@PissedOffBiotic but i did get his autograph tho. So, next best thing? Yeh.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-16 07:03:34	@PissedOffBiotic tyty, you will one day! Maybe NYCC! He might hop down even tho its mainly comics and some games :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-16 07:10:56	So, we got an ETA when my family can move back to our house. It's around May 1st. So, yeah. That's a date at least.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-16 07:26:49	@ceae bae, we can share. We share the bot lane together... also, it gives me a champ i can actually trade with you :p
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-16 07:53:39	@nhales80 they are the dark knights... they don't ask to be praised... or... they just don't know...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-16 07:54:52	Hmm... i want to go to a convention this year, but don't know which... Otakon for old times sake?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-16 07:55:35	@nhales80 oh thats good, i hate when they try to sell shit you don't need. I just want the fix and not some minor thing that won't fix it...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-16 07:56:21	Actually, i might try for NYCC this year! Never been and it's been awhile since I've been to the big apple. That'll be my goal!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-16 07:57:23	One thing i hate about tournament games is... the time between games... like... fuck... hurry up! Stahp talking!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-01-15 17:09:18	http://t.co/AMZoifGpM3 》What I thonk when I'm out.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-05 06:47:58	@ceae games. I know they have physical items as well, but nothing i think worth it.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-05 07:01:31	@PissedOffBiotic aren't you a nerd? So, you're just calling yourself cute and precious, huh?

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-07 03:43:36	You know you're slowly becoming an adult when you take vitamins, but brought back down to childhood because they are gummy vitamins.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-07 03:45:03	@PerfectChaos_x I'm going to buy oreos tomorrow to make you jelly. Double stuf. Reese's. Strawberry Ice Cream... mint... ew...

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-07 17:33:14	Do... you ever feel... like... you're a plastic bag? Drifting through the wind? Wanting... to start again?

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-09 18:17:45	@ceae Sucks. With time and patience, your mmr will rise! Then you'll be lifted of your curseeeee!

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-09 20:44:09	@SkittlesCanFly_ i blame @nerohkun and @FloppyHaddock
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-09 21:32:28	@SkittlesCanFly_ @nerohkun @FloppyHaddock and matt likes butts, giraffe butts!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-09 22:07:19	@FloppyHaddock @SkittlesCanFly_ @nerohkun oop, looks like all the cats died. Thanks Jack!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-09 22:21:01	@FloppyHaddock @SkittlesCanFly_ @nerohkun All in favor for hating Jack and replacing him with Colin, say aye!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-09 23:06:04	It's raining. It's pouring. Stahp it.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-09 23:08:27	I'm pretty Lee Pace is a racist. Most of his roles are racist people. LotR: Elves, Lincoln: Blacks, Pushing Daises: The Dead.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-10 01:21:28	@PerfectChaos_x Damn... I forgot to buy them this weekend... i just had doritos laying about... SHAREEEE!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-10 01:29:53	@PerfectChaos_x WTF?! Those are individually sleeved! Didn't know they came in those. I only see the fully packaged ones with 3 rows!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-10 01:34:08	@PerfectChaos_x it's like you bought a package of oreos but picked out the flavors... that sounds awesome... Oreos, get on that!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-09 13:34:55	Despite my weekend ofany losses, i still had fun duoing with @ceae . Naut-vir bot lane op. Hue.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-11 02:08:03	Lost Girl is kind of a modern Buffy...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-10 05:02:47	.@ceae we have to take this to bot lane. http://t.co/NyDM3VgWrA
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-11 21:58:31	@PissedOffBiotic it's because you're awesome and pretty! Awe-retty! Or... Presome! Or Pretty Awesome!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-11 22:00:48	I hope i don't smell... my school had a sewage issue and half of the school, the half i work in, smelled like shit.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-11 22:09:34	..the headless student on the swings... http://t.co/Q0LhoIYbGb
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-11 22:13:24	@PissedOffBiotic /hugglez don't cri bb.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-11 22:35:39	I wish i was talented in some field. Like, i feel like I'm pretty good at video games. I guess that's a start.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-12 00:04:37	Time to take off my pants and watch Parks and Rec! #Relaxed #TreatYoSelf
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-10 06:04:37	@ceae i guess. It's more themed i guess. Trying to put the lore back together haha.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-10 06:27:21	@ceae YEAH! But, we're limited because of your limited champ pool. But we can make it work!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-10 06:32:56	@ceae I'm just saying! We can do it, but we have to pick and choose. Like, Sivir Nasus. She helped him reclaim Shurima. Even tho thats new.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-12 08:14:29	@ceae fo sho best ADC in da world (not really, but you're my favorite one to lane with)  I'll be on forever trying to climb the ranks!

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-12 06:45:40	.@ceae http://t.co/0TmrbH5FY4 the ones for jungle and support are rood &gt;:c
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-12 06:59:59	@ceae they make us look like slaves and servants! Racist rito! &gt;:c
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-12 07:03:16	@ceae ...guess whose not hooking and snaring your lane now... /goes on strike hue
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-12 07:27:31	@ceae also, you up for some league Saturday night?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-12 20:32:54	Valentine's is coming up and I'm going to spend it watching something on Netflix and play video games... alone... in the dark...eating candy
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-10 18:18:51	Huh... I guess weed dealers are using job search sites now... http://t.co/IjE5hwbz1N
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-11 21:09:35	I need to cut my hair and take like five showers because of a "shitty" day at work. Amirite?! http://t.co/c0ikG1OiJO

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-13 19:53:40	This is why i love Valentine's Day: FREE CANDY BITCHES! http://t.co/RcXGMeXngQ
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-13 22:32:29	Wtf? These GRE questions ate stupid and don't make sense. Fuck youuuuuuuu!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-13 20:42:34	I forget its Friday the 13th today. Ah well. I got free candy.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-13 20:43:22	So, you wants to have a skype date tomorrow night? ;D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-13 20:47:36	Maybe i should go out on Valentine's day and pick up some ladiessss... nah... i rather sit home and be alone :') [dying inside]
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 04:23:00	@PerfectChaos_x True. They had great models for every character. Let's just hope they make Sonic Boom better instead of family friendly.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 04:23:38	@PerfectChaos_x i mean, Sonic is always family friendly, but i mean, don't make it all sunshine and butterflies.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 04:31:31	@PerfectChaos_x That gimmick was interesting. It's a nice way to bring a lot of the roster back. We can have a Chaos team with Silver.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 04:36:43	@PerfectChaos_x who is this silver? Why you bringing up things that don't exist Stace?! You cray. Next order of business! Make Charmy less
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 04:36:51	@PerfectChaos_x annoying sounding!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 05:36:40	@PerfectChaos_x I had it. Don't know where it is now. Probably lent it to a friend long ago. Anyways any plays for Valentine's day in Whales
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 05:38:41	@PerfectChaos_x Aww poir you. /pat pat. Your twitter activity has been off since you've been coupled imo. But that can be many things. But..
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 05:39:27	@PerfectChaos_x WELCOME BACK TO THE SINGLES CLUBBBBB! We've got ice cream and bon bons and cookies! And a bunch of RomCom Moviessss! 😄
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 05:41:11	@PerfectChaos_x that's how it always starts off... in movies anyways. Then your best friend, me, cheers you up with fun facts like a SNAPPLE
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-13 21:02:07	@PissedOffBiotic NO! HAPPY VALENTINE! ACCEPT MAH LUV! ♡♡♡♡♡
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-13 21:03:15	@PissedOffBiotic My first accepted Valentine... uh... you're fired. /walks away
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-13 21:06:54	I wish @FloppyHaddock would come to the states and whisk me away to the UK with his muscles and... nah... nevermind.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-13 21:08:00	This is what i think about heart shaped cookies! Take that cookie! http://t.co/VBiPV3OdCP
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-13 21:12:19	@ceae ...don't know if it's becayse of thr card or its because it's from me :c
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-13 21:29:13	@FloppyHaddock ...your profile pic... why are you holding an apple... this is why Jack.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 03:17:41	@PerfectChaos_x i just wish they either: Go back to their roots or make another Battle Adventure game. WITH MOAR CHAO'S!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 01:06:13	@PerfectChaos_x frack no... i only find regular ones i see on a daily basis... maybe i need to try better stores...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 01:07:20	...i spent 2 hours studying math, JUST MATH, problems for the GREs... i hate math... i hate words... i hate school bullshit...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 01:21:21	@PerfectChaos_x I get me some for myself for Valentine's day :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 02:13:08	@PerfectChaos_x Ooo, nice! A classic. But a better on is Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric. Best Sonic game. Tee hee.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 02:24:19	@PerfectChaos_x it's baddddddd. I wat hed BSC play it... i almost died just watching it...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 17:05:39	Happy Valentine's Day everybody! I luv u all! ლ(|||⌒εー|||)ლ
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 23:06:56	Then all of sudden, Elsa decided to fuck up Berryville. http://t.co/GIFV2Tsd5g
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 04:38:57	@PerfectChaos_x *cough* replace charmy with Mighty *cough* apparently, he was supposed to be Sonic. Model wise. I read up on why he never
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 05:57:17	.@ceae kinda realized that today is Valentine's Day... so, if you have plans with your boo thang tonight i won't be mad if you didn't play 😁
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 03:24:20	@PerfectChaos_x ...that never existed. No! I just want one good Sonic game... just one... remake Chaoix, i don't care... just make it good!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 03:40:14	@PerfectChaos_x that's a good point. Maybe patience is the answer when dealing with Sega. I'm assume we're in for another Sonic Boom game.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 03:50:43	@PerfectChaos_x do you think they'll ever revert back to old sonic or Adventure's sonic?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 04:39:44	@PerfectChaos_x there. Someone in sega who made him apparently left and took the rights.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 04:40:27	@PerfectChaos_x 😞 i think you're seeing things...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 04:44:41	@PerfectChaos_x Maybe you can see in alternate dimensions where this... Sonic 06 and Crisis City existed... Yer a hairy wizard....
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 05:21:36	@PerfectChaos_x when did it not glitch out? Ugh... makes Superman 64 Game of the Year. Nah. That game is worse... but sonic 06 is near.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 05:26:16	@PerfectChaos_x level? It was more like going through the 15 or whatever rings of hell. I don't think i ever saw Lex Luthor.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 05:31:16	@PerfectChaos_x i think that game alone is the true relic of being a kid growing up in the 90s with an N64 and not breaking everything u own
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 06:00:54	@ceae So, it's a date then? Cool. So i won't be too alone this weekend :D unless you're playing other games, which is cool too!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-15 08:04:14	Why am I still up? Blarg... time to watch more YouTube videos till I sleep.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-14 22:05:03	Hope everyone's Valentine's Day, both coupled and single, is going great!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-15 20:13:13	MercTingTing just deleted bitches 10/2/5 as Lulu on Summoner's Rift #LeagueOfLegends http://t.co/3GwF9ht2ZH @ceae

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-18 07:21:24	Kalista is so weird to play after the whole passive nerf or change. I haven't tried her since she's always goddamned banned. But yeh...

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-19 06:22:08	I feel like there's a difference between CoD and LoL trolling. It might just be the community that's the difference.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-19 23:34:00	@ceae so bad that it's good! Just accept the tasteful punniness of my puns.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-19 07:03:03	Seeing some twitter drama... let's watch.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-19 07:16:19	Don't know if true or not... I'll research it later. Too late to think.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-19 07:52:00	It's weird to see people from high school adding me on Facebook. I just look at them on my friend requests.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-19 07:57:38	People be mad when I pick Top Crank in norms. Goddamn. It's not srs tiem! #LeagueofLegends

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-20 04:57:19	Public schools around me are closed, but my school is open like a boss! More time it's open, the more money I make. I ain't mad.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-20 05:01:25	@PissedOffBiotic HA! Look at all these people looking for people but are really specific! http://t.co/ByJ2Hbo0iR
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-20 05:17:15	Blehh.... I forget most of my shows have a dating arc and it makes me cri inside :(
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-20 05:18:27	But then, I realize I can do whatever I want without anyone telling me I can't! Except for the CAHPS! But yeh.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-20 18:52:02	Who wants to snuggle with me? :3

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-21 09:56:52	Okay. League'd out. Time to go sleep and wake up in the butt crack of dawn :D Goodbye sleep schedule.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-21 09:57:08	It's so late, I forgot how to spell schedule... Thanks Google.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-21 07:00:47	Having a low Facebook friend count makes me feel good :3
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-21 07:02:39	@TheMechromancer Burn him.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-21 07:03:39	I should keep a protractor on me at all times. So, when chicks as why I have it, I just wink and tell them...

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-21 15:57:29	My hair is frozen...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-21 17:23:13	Dragonborn came on my phone and i basically jizzed my pants cause it felt i was in Skyrim.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-21 07:27:39	I'm not one for pick-up lines. I can make bad ones, but I never use it for myself because I'm repulsive :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-24 06:34:41	@ceae Sink cleaning is always atrocious. Everything you left in there sits and becomes smelly bacteria and ew.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-24 06:36:48	@ceae Oh shit son! Tell me the eta so I can figure out what game mode I should play.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-02-24 06:51:29	@PerfectChaos_xo Honestly, knowing him, he'd nod and smile and hug you and say, "OKAY!" In his cheery voice.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-01 03:38:27	Also, being the only psych major and over analyzing everyone's behavior is concerning me. Especially, the one friend who is off a long relat

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-01 05:02:52	I feel like I need to be more abrasive. Not too abrasive. Like, April Ludgate abrasive.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-01 05:03:04	Or Ron Swanson.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-01 05:03:15	I wish I was Ron Swanson.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-01 06:20:19	@PerfectChaos_xo that's my reason. Mark does it some times, but not enuf for me to hate him.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-01 07:03:52	@PerfectChaos_xo or really foreign. Mark is exotic. Like papaya.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-01 07:08:33	@PerfectChaos_xo teeth that shines as bright as a 1000 suns.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-03 05:02:38	Sitting over a vent is godlike. Until it gets too hot and it starts burning your ass....

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-04 21:28:57	@PissedOffBiotic we live exciting working lives. And the east coast might as well be fucking Winterfell. WINTER IS COMING AND IT'S STAYING
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-04 21:32:02	@PissedOffBiotic srsly... i used to be tan... I miss my summer glow... i forget what the sun looks like. How much snow you getting friend?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-04 21:51:06	I'm so jealoud of those going to PAX East :c i just didn't have money to go this year and a buddy to go with...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-04 22:06:02	@ceae ...i just read that you were... now i feel like a dick... thanks tina QnQ
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-04 22:27:31	Learning Spanish and German... Germab is fucking hardddddddddd. So many harsh vowels.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-04 22:50:36	@ceae are... are you dead...? IS THIS THE SPIRIT OF TINA?! Or is this QT? It'd be cool if it was QT. Or Meow. It'll make more sense.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-04 23:51:29	@PissedOffBiotic about the same :/ during these times of constant snow is when i wish i lived on the West coast... beautiful beaches and sun
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-04 23:53:24	@PissedOffBiotic i adore cold weather cause it makes me sleep better, but I like to go out sometimes. Not much, but enuf where i don't feel

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-05 00:12:11	@PissedOffBiotic That is a good amount of time to be out. But i have to endure it when my friends want me to come out to a bar. I hate bars.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-05 00:12:29	@ceae You're a cat.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-05 00:13:45	@PissedOffBiotic jfc, the prices are stupid. I can by a six pack for one drink at a bar. If i don't have to pay, I'm good. I only like fruit
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-05 00:14:36	@PissedOffBiotic fruity drinks or mixed drinks. Like hard cider or something mixed and sweet. Dats how i roll. /swag on 8)
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-05 00:37:26	@PissedOffBiotic that's why Happy Hour is a Maker send. The only time of the day where drinking a lot doesn't murder my wallet.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-05 00:38:15	There it is fellas, no school tomorrow cause of the snow. I made no money last month and now this month...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-05 01:01:52	@PissedOffBiotic i suggest you do if you can get off work before 5. That's when they usually do it. Or go out on ladies night.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-05 01:06:39	@PissedOffBiotic you could also meet potential mates! Other than those on Okc. I feel that quality is lacking there or it maybe my area...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-05 01:14:49	@PissedOffBiotic from your results, i don't blame you. But i know a girl as pretty as you will find your SO! Whether it be man, woman, asari
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-05 07:24:09	@ceae hm... Not impressive. If ALL your stats werr higher than your team, then i would be. Singed beat you in Assists!

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-05 07:57:31	Whoa... phone updated... everything feels... weirdddddd
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-05 07:58:21	@ceae cause dat lulu is a bitchhhhhhh. I would've run in with you and lagged and died! #WeQueueTogetherWeDieTogetherWellMaybeIJustDie
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-05 08:00:06	Makes me happy to see BSC play Cave Story! One of my favorite games :3
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-05 21:56:45	Too much snow... https://t.co/zyTzVbo4dy
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-05 23:50:37	Too many people at PAX East and I'm not one of them QnQ
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-03 22:15:48	Thought a kid at work yell, "NOBODY CAN DEFEAT THIS NIGGA!" but he said "mega..."
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-07 06:59:50	Staying off twitter till the PAX East Hype dwindles... :'(
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-06 09:22:30	Ugh, played with the worst TF in ARAM. BADDDDDDD. @ceae
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-06 09:53:21	@ceae More like I played Tanks every ARAM since no one knows how to tank, including you.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-08 02:35:06	Has twitter calmed down from PAX East hype? Is it safe to come out now? QwQ
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-08 03:46:58	Going with that Taric Jungle! Let's do this! #LeagueOfLegends
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-08 04:30:41	MercTingTing just went 6/4/17 as Taric on Summoner's Rift #LeagueOfLegends http://t.co/39SXZW5A91 @ceae Just. Armor. Baby.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-08 17:06:28	@PerfectChaos_xo look. Nothing :c http://t.co/CELIqfivIW
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-08 17:08:44	@PerfectChaos_xo you know how many productive things that won't be done? Haha
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-08 17:17:50	@PerfectChaos_xo you right, you right. So, when you gonna move to the states roomie? :3 l0l
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-08 17:21:10	@PerfectChaos_xo yes, cause "stalking with love" sounds better than "stalking with the intent to hug them until they are yours."
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-08 20:08:16	I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/YjFoMXCdVR DBZ- Vegeta's SSJ Theme Extended
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-08 22:00:55	It was nice talking to @FloppyHaddock @nerohkun @LordVenomania and others :3

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-09 18:57:59	I have "Rock the Dragon" as my ringtone right now. I feel epic when i reply back to texts.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-09 19:03:56	@BackupFruit I'm not on that level yet. I can go only to Kaioken x2 :/
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-09 20:47:52	Don't let me get in my zone.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-10 22:02:15	So, my friends are making a new (probably short) film. This should be interesting.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-10 22:12:54	Hopefully everything goes smoothly this time...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-11 11:27:22	Day 1 of shooting: ...I barely got sleep and i woke up way before I liked... just like the good ol' days. Just need coffee or crack...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-11 11:59:26	I like when places yell out numbers and when my order number is called, it's like I won something.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-11 12:48:12	Day 1 of shooting: Meth trailer! http://t.co/nNH1ZUROHv
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-13 06:59:54	It's @ceae 's turn to play Bard. Let's just get this out of the way and say I'm the better Bard ;D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-13 07:59:43	TAKING A NAP AT 10 PM IS THE WORST THING EVER! I'M AWAKE MOTHAFUCKA!

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-12 22:17:43	"Shake It Off" is probably the only Taylor Swift song that I can tolerate and enjoy. It's not a bad song.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-14 18:15:40	Dear @ceae, I'm going to use Brad one more time (probably more than that) with you :3
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-14 18:16:15	Stopping by the house today to remember all the stuff i don't have anymore :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-14 18:17:08	@PerfectChaos_x ahh okay.  But i thought it was a requirement for all Batman's to never smile and speak all rough.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-14 18:24:20	@ceae /hug you won't. I've learned how to Brad better now :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-13 20:12:40	.@ceae have i told you how much i hate Montecristo's face and sense of fashion? If i didn't,  it's more than the universe can handle.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-13 20:19:10	@ceae he tries to be. He's like a korean weeaboo. I don't know a proper term, but if i could make one, I'd just use his name.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-15 18:12:58	@ceae Nah, it's not that bad. At least there aren't any Geth attacking... OMIGAWD RUN!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-15 20:39:12	That moment where I wonder, "Why am I following this person?"

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-15 22:18:54	@ceae why is that a question? It's amazing.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-16 17:40:49	Dear Nintendo,

Please return Mario Party into its friend breaking glory. That's all I ask.

Love, Merc TingTing ♡
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-15 22:55:50	@ceae she's somewhat better. You should try her when you get the chance. The small buff where her orbs are faster is a big thing.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-15 23:41:02	Ha, I love looking through people's Facebook pictures. Especially the girls, they have the same exact look every time.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-15 23:42:07	Like, they superimposed their head to each picture. Variation is a thing.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-15 23:42:52	And don't try to flip the image to "make it look different." I'm no stupid dumb!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-16 19:08:25	@nerohkun you finally got that "dick in ear" syndrome fixed eh? Nice.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-16 19:10:16	@nerohkun I guess that's how the saying goes, "Two peepees make hearing better."
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-16 19:11:20	I wish i could pick out all my twitter friends out and live with them. It would be an awesome sitcom. Like big bang, but less bad.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-16 19:13:35	Most of the people i like on here are mainly nerdy and live in many fandoms. Then i would put a person who isn't as nerd buy hot. Man and wo
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-16 19:14:52	@nerohkun @FloppyHaddock Papa Jack? Nah, Mama Jack! He'll have his chicken face from Minecraft.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-16 19:18:14	Like, it would like that shitty show "King of the Nerds" but like, everyone is awesome and not a bad representation of nerds and geeks.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-16 19:20:24	@FloppyHaddock @nerohkun I want meatloaf! Also, Matt is bein' a lil' cunt mama!

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-19 21:27:20	One of my students asked if there was another level in this game I made up, I replied, "Maybe there is, maybe there isn't. Maybe you should-
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-19 21:27:49	"Go in your car and go home." Almost told the kid, "Maybe you should go fuck yourself."
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-21 03:33:28	Tonight was a fun night. Remet new people and met new people! I'm becoming a Social Sam! Or... butterfly. Or dragon. Yep. Dragon.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-22 07:50:17	@ceae I'm sorry we lost our ARAM. But we won our norms game with flying colors :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-22 08:04:35	@ceae idk. We always get a bunch of dumbs in ARAM. But we also dominate bot lane! (I'm Lilith, you're Maya) http://t.co/9qmH8p4Wgy
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-22 18:02:11	It's been a good long while since I've been to the Cheesecake Factory. Place is packed. All i know is that I'm  getting some cheesecake!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-22 18:19:41	I would hate to work at the Cheesecake Factory, but also love it cause Cheesecake!

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-22 19:33:58	My hair got complimented by a woman today. I never get compliments. What is the world coming to...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-22 19:35:00	Also, what do you say to that? Just "thanks?" I wanted to say something smooth, but the only thing I could think of, "I like your face."
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-22 19:35:19	She was cute.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-20 21:55:13	Had a dliemma where I go hang out with friends I knew for years or hang out with at my coworkers place with random people who game. Sooooooo

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-23 17:50:22	@PerfectChaos_x Your hubby is in the hospital. You probably know, but thought I should tell you.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-23 17:50:53	.@YouTube @LindseyStirling this is amazing!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-23 17:53:20	I'm tired... I took a power nap and then I realized I had to be responsible today... QnQ

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-24 23:30:05	@ceae new teemo skin coming out. Omega Squad Teemo i think. Rito had a special thing on their website.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-23 00:21:02	@PerfectChaos_x I ate it. Well, half. But it was still good. :3
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-23 17:52:37	@PerfectChaos_x Why is he in the hospital? Do you know? Or is it for that intestine thing...?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-23 17:54:05	@PerfectChaos_x ahh okay. Just making sure it wasn't anything else. For your sake haha. And you outside? Oooo. How's the sunlight?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-23 17:55:34	@PerfectChaos_x Oreos in general are worth the pain. Have fun with those! Don't eat them all in one place!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-24 18:14:20	So many reboots and sequels coming out the woodwork. Good god.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-24 18:25:20	I didn't expect Bloodborne to do that well. Now I have another game to purchase when I get my PS4.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-24 18:26:20	@nhales80 I wonder if they will release during URF mode season. Then you can be sure that you'll get Teemo in every game.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-24 20:56:41	Holy shit. This new Pokémon set is going to be sick. The new stadium card is awesome. Able to have 8 benched Pokémon instead of 5!

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 18:06:04	Why do most notary publics look miserable? I want my notary public to be like Gerry-Larry-Terry-Gary Gergich!

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 21:25:56	Had a 6 or 7 year old student go white girl wasted rage moments ago. That shit was funny.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 22:14:55	@nerohkun @FloppyHaddock nah. You move here. I'm here.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 22:16:20	@LordVenomania I would move to Canadia, but they don't have much when it comes to gaming and cons.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 22:17:42	@LordVenomania ... You cheatin on me boy?!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 22:21:49	@LordVenomania is she a native or a brit?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 22:26:52	@LordVenomania whoa. She's lost. Why the fuck she all the way up there? Ah well. Congrats? I dunno. You're a meanie for cheating on me.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 22:27:31	@ceae yoooo, you gonna be busy this weekend?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 22:39:28	@LordVenomania it is. I don't blame her. Is she hot?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 22:44:43	So, I might be getting my computer back this friday. I know I might now, I'm pretty sure I'm not, but at least there's a chance!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 22:45:32	Then I can play Dragon Age Inquisition and all the games I bought via Steam sale! Imma be a busy beetle!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 23:18:16	"@moobeat: 3/25 #PBE Update: Omega Squad Teemo http://t.co/YaUUy5zJGj http://t.co/22d7OY5AfC" @ceae
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 23:36:26	@ceae Sweet! We can do epic League stuff! :D and I might get my computer this friday or next!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 23:36:49	@ceae unless you're doing irl stuff with other people, then I understand.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 23:47:42	I miss playing Guild Wars 2 :/ never beat end game cause everyone else did haha...ha... :'c
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 23:49:14	@PissedOffBiotic this is why we shouldn't put random ass people on television.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 23:56:50	@PissedOffBiotic True. But it's mainly uh... A&amp;E's (or whatever network) for giving them a limelight. Yeah freedom of speech and all that
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 23:57:10	@PissedOffBiotic but it gave them a bigger voice than need be.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 23:58:15	@PissedOffBiotic at least they're not on television anymore. So that's one less bad show on the air. :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-25 23:59:56	Spring break for my school is next week. Probably gonna finish off some stuff on my Netflix Q and hopefully game :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 00:01:00	@PissedOffBiotic I'm pretty sure they are after the whole homophobic speech that same bigot gave at some rally. Why can't people get along.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 00:04:23	@PissedOffBiotic At my school, I try to give everyone there that being LGBT isn't a problem. I'm pretty open about my sexuality. I've
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 00:04:58	@PissedOffBiotic complimented men on how handsome and hot they are and my students seem to have a problem with it. I'm not gay, but I know
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 00:05:24	@PissedOffBiotic i know what great art looks like.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 00:11:02	@PissedOffBiotic Yeah. Thats why most MANLY MEN still call other dudes "faggots" or use "gay" as insults. I'm glad most of my guy friends
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 00:11:13	@PissedOffBiotic are more understanding.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 00:18:44	@PissedOffBiotic yeah, it's getting there. Here's to hoping that it gets better in less than 5 years. I doubt it because of that DuckDynasty
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 00:19:09	@PissedOffBiotic guy continually giving out his hate speeches and making the news about it.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 00:25:50	@PissedOffBiotic society hasn't changed much when it comes to gender roles. Once we break that mold, that generation can lead the way.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 00:34:40	I want my computer... QnQ
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 00:36:30	Uhh.   Maybe i should stop talking about my computer since I'm getting a bunch of random ass tech bot accounts following me...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 00:36:39	I'm pretty sure they are...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 00:44:13	What the fucking shit! Fuck off! http://t.co/UMr4UJc2dq

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 20:33:11	I feel like I should replay all the Dragon Age's to give my mind a refresher.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 20:34:35	This is all because I might get my computer tomorrow... It's been so long since I actually gamed. Other than the occasional LoL and Clash.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 20:34:50	I feel like those don't really suffice my gaming needs.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 20:35:33	Like how a salad can be substituted as a meal. Fuck that!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 20:36:53	Now I'm hungry... and I want sushi...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 20:38:01	Omg. Sushi cake!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 20:39:21	I want this as my birthday cake. You other motherfuckers can your fluffy shit. http://t.co/LCF6uTq8f3
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 20:39:48	I want some unagi on that bish doe. Other than that, I'll eat it all up!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-26 21:21:22	My spring break just started baby!!! To start it off, a mile around the nearby pond-marsh-swamp thingy!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-27 23:14:41	@PerfectChaos_x Yes you do. MOVE HERE! :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-27 23:18:53	@PerfectChaos_x well if you do, I'll have a castle of oreos waiting for your arrival! Hsha
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-27 03:18:06	Might give Infinite Crisis a shot. Just gonna spam Harley Quinn tho.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-27 16:38:04	I listen to @katyperry to feel happy :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-28 03:07:04	I would like to dedicate my Kalista win to @C9Sneaky Your streams help me channel my inner butthole.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-31 17:48:51	But I guess I could use some vitamin D.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-03-31 17:49:50	And fresh unfiltered air.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-05 11:14:48	Why do I have to wake up at this ungodly hour to go to a GODLY building and pretend to be nice to people?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-05 11:15:39	This is when I wish a giant rift would open destroying the church and me able to go back to sleep. QwQ

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-05 12:42:18	I don't like going to church. Everyone is a mindless zombie stand and kneeling in a some what unison. Sp00ky.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-03 06:43:26	...Angry that I can't buy Dragon Age Inquisition...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-03 06:50:51	Why can't steam and Origin be friends and put their shit together? I'm tired of having two providers... It's like having two sets of parents
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-03 06:59:18	Contacting EA support... Nice...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-03 07:02:14	@PerfectChaos_x Dayummmmmmmm. You look LIKE THE SUN! :D

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-03 07:10:17	I keep forgetting that my security answers... they're fucking stupid..
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-03 07:12:21	@TheMechromancer I would gladly do so! I'm Asian, so it's in our blood to give GREAT massages! I've gotten compliments of them as well. :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-03 07:14:42	So... Some jackass tried to buy shit on my Origin account... making me unable to buy Dragon Age Inquisition... Fucking asshole.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-03 07:16:40	QnQ I have to wait longer to get Dragon Age Inquisition...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-03 07:18:01	I wouldn't be having this probably if I was a console guy, but it's $30 bucks on origin... &gt;.&gt;;
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-03 07:24:03	@PissedOffBiotic REWATCH THEM AGAIN!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-03 07:24:37	I should talk to these Origin Support team more often. Give dem coupon codesssssss!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-03 07:26:37	Jeez... I think it was all worth it? Got a 15% discount code and I know someone tried to buy FIFA on my account. Awesome.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-08 19:20:36	Damn I'm cute when I'm sad. https://t.co/WFcOfIzVhX
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-08 19:21:54	@PerfectChaos_x Trish Stratus...? I think... I was always a Stacy Kiebler guy ;D and  Torrie Wilson.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-08 19:24:04	@PerfectChaos_x I see you! That's when WWE divas weren't over done imo.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-08 19:25:31	@PerfectChaos_x Oh damn. I remember her. She was the badass out of all of them and the only not blonde one.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-06 20:30:30	Hey guys! I'm back to uploading videos &amp; I thought I should promote a bit here! https://t.co/574BGzue1m #LeagueOfLegends
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-08 04:49:28	I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/id2KVNrlq1 Blue Man Group - Game of Thrones Cover
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-08 20:40:16	DA: I plays a little bit like Guild Wars 2. I love it. I've been sitting at one area exploring all day :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-08 20:48:23	Not saying that it's a bad thing. It gives me more time to appreciate the textures and art. :3
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-08 05:30:35	@PerfectChaos_x straight jizz. So goooooooooodddddd. We actually have those here. It's like second nature to have cookies n cream be
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-08 05:30:46	@PerfectChaos_x Oreo cookies n cream.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-08 05:31:47	So far, I like DA: I. Every Dragon Age does something different to its combat system. I don't really mind it. I understand why they made it.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-09 21:09:46	I gotta figure out my mic settings for recording. My voice is either too loud or too  quiet.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-09 07:09:44	10 hours in Dragon Age: Inquisition. Love it. Spent most of it just questing and exploring. But its not boring doing so.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-09 07:10:48	When can I edit my tweets instead of deleting it and retyping the bitch? Fuck typos...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-09 07:21:54	Just for future reference to people I meet: I don't judge you. I only judge you if I hate you. :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-09 07:22:24	And at that point,  we're probably not friends and I disapprove everything you do.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-11 04:43:50	Tonight was a great night. I say, "GREAT BIRTHDAY WEEK OL' BEAN!"

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-17 16:21:31	Idk... maybe I'm just a pessimist when it comes to relationships... or The Grinch.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-17 18:26:06	Jfc... Bath and Bodyworks is weird... it's like I fell in a white girl's dream.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-17 21:45:00	My mum's bday present. https://t.co/8X0BzB38T8
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-19 05:25:00	Reasons why I chose a Psych Degree: I'm good at listening to people.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-19 05:25:30	Pretty much the reason. Also, I'm not good at anything else except video games.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-20 22:24:31	Beer sampler babyyyyyyy https://t.co/6QxrhfnceV
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-20 23:19:21	League of Legends | Ep. 112 - I've Been... NAUT-Y!: http://t.co/cyYmEXcwZt via @YouTube
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-20 23:51:29	I wish I had a house on top of a mountain. With wifi ofc.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-19 22:29:58	@PerfectChaos_x ikr? I want to get rid of mine :/ Always in the way and getting me into trouble...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-19 22:31:36	@PerfectChaos_x We'll be so buff! &gt;:D We'll look like Goku in no time!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-20 02:35:04	@Pearcour It'll make millions and become my favorite movie of all time.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-20 19:14:49	Beep boop https://t.co/ZZoTos2eBi
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-20 03:53:00	From what I figured: when a couple that's been dating for a long time breaks up, everyone gets engaged. Fact.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-20 04:59:28	Dragon Age Inquisition just had a Grinch moment. Lol
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-21 04:03:46	FUCKKKKK. I think I might have to play DA2 all over again... blargggg.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-21 04:06:13	Le sad. My Hawke was awesome... Sigh I'll just continue playing DAI and probably replay DA2 some other time when I'm bored.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-21 04:26:07	@BackupFruit shit... you're right dad. I'll never pretend to be french again. /bow
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-23 03:36:12	Time to take care off my Inquisition!

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-23 03:50:36	Idk if I like not knowing how much my companions like/hate me... it's unsettling...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-23 05:01:20	I think I'll go as a Reaver Inquisition this play through.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-23 06:54:53	Weird to see the trends on the side of my twitter...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-23 08:38:49	@FloppyHaddock Uhmerikanz only!

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-22 21:43:11	Beat my PR Mark on the trail. Went further than last week! #LetsGoooo https://t.co/clxR8d86Mu
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-22 21:58:45	Trying to stay fit is alright. I feel less of a piece of shit and more of a fit piece of shit. I'll take the small victories. ∩(︶▽︶)∩
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-22 22:31:56	@nerohkun i get to play with you next week :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-22 22:34:17	@nerohkun we gonna run up on bitches and go pew pew!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-22 22:39:28	@nerohkun i forget you Britanians don't say "pounds," you use rocks. Weird and congratz. Miss Neroh must be proudddddd.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-22 22:41:17	@nerohkun don't change it now just for me! You lost a rock! We must find it! I think I lost a few pebbles...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-22 22:44:08	Who wants to go to Canada?!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-24 21:03:36	@LordVenomania congrats... freakin weeb... hue.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-24 21:04:47	My favorite fruit are grapes. The best thing to throw at people whilst being sneaky. (¬‿¬)
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-25 23:21:25	Ahh... cookies and cream Ice cream with a dash of strawberry! http://t.co/B0p55yYQpt
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-25 23:59:49	Huh... [gets hit by car] https://t.co/uvWqhzoHya
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-26 05:35:29	Fun night was fun. Played some Mario Kart 8 and traded some Pokemon. Good tiem. 10/10 will do again.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-26 05:39:42	Mario Kart 8 is a lot more fun playing with someone else than alone IMO... I guess you can say that about most things...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-26 05:39:59	Unless you hate people... then... Pets usually fit that position.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-26 05:43:00	Also glad these two friends of mine are getting married. They are gamers as well, so the theme of the wedding is going to be EPIK NICE!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-26 07:27:20	I wish I was good with words. If I can put big words together, some people may think I'm smart. "Blah blah blah Flux Capacitor."
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-26 08:40:36	Well now... tumblr changed a bit... What do things do...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-25 00:34:58	Changed my steam icon to a Goddess. http://t.co/3nUXesGi3b
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-26 08:49:45	God... certain relationships make me question humanity...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-26 08:53:17	Wish I liked wine more. So I can be sassy all the time with a stern look on my face.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-25 03:07:29	@PissedOffBiotic @TheMechromancer But in all non-gif-y-ness, I agree on what she said. You look fantastic!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-25 05:57:03	I don't know what to playyyyyy QnQ
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-25 05:57:17	Like, I want to play something, and then I don't...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-25 05:57:59	Fuck it... I'm just watch a good ol' porno with a good story.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-25 06:03:44	I forgot I bought the Dead Space Trilogy... I'mma shit my pants when they are all done downloading... which will take the rest of teh night.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-28 01:56:01	I hate falling asleep with my contacts on... they're a bitch to take off... my eyes hurt like hell...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-28 01:58:24	About to watch Game of Thrones. :3
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-28 02:21:39	I still want a suit of armor...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-28 02:59:06	Huh! Interesting end to Game of Thrones.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-28 03:05:10	Welp,  back to Thedas I go! May my horns be true and my sword be just! #DragonAgeInquisition
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-28 03:24:23	I find it funny that you're invincible in Skyhold. Cause falling from a 3 story high wall won't kill me.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-28 05:10:42	My Qunari hitting on Cass. Damn he's tall as fuck doe. http://t.co/O8ed1mdMxy

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-28 06:30:50	I like broccoli. The only other vegetable that I can tolerate next to lettuce.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-26 22:20:57	Taking a shot into CS:GO competitive... ha. Gun jokes.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-27 00:51:06	Today has been quite uneventful. Hmm... Boop.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-27 01:17:44	I hate when casual/unranked games become a place for ragers to rage... Play ranked to be a try hard... poop face...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-28 18:18:21	What is life? Why is the sky blue? Where is Nessie? When will DC Comics make a good movie? https://t.co/dZ4ZlJw1F6
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-27 01:25:33	Fuck it. Let's go old school and play Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 baby!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-28 20:39:04	Playing Pokémon at work. You know, the usual.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-28 21:32:00	I think my stomachular (it's a scientific term. Trust me.) is getting smaller. Huh.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-28 21:50:28	Fight like a Krogan, run like a leopard. But, you'll never be better than Commander Shepard! https://t.co/zVYdpXQYdS

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-29 00:00:34	Getting mothafuckin Oreo's. Worth the gas.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-29 00:02:42	@PissedOffBiotic Tell me, what do you use Yak for? I find it to be like twitter, but for people around you in a 50 mile radius...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-29 00:04:00	Kinda wanna bring a pair of hedge cutters and cut every selfie stick I see.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-29 00:07:10	@PissedOffBiotic Cause those are the most important things people need to ask now a days. Seems really attention seeking. From what I saw...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-29 00:08:00	@PissedOffBiotic on the commercial, it's like, "Hey, I'm alone, be friends with me pls. Pls..." i guess it's a okay social media thing
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-29 00:08:40	@PissedOffBiotic but I find it weird... I'm weird that way. I'm still having issues with online dating...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-29 00:10:18	@PissedOffBiotic i was about to bring that up. Seems like the best booty call advert. Better than tinder. You can put a news letter when
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-29 00:10:27	@PissedOffBiotic u can bang. And hours and wages.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-29 00:14:09	@PissedOffBiotic how's your quest to find a mate?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-29 00:21:43	@PerfectChaos_x i never knew they made MEGA STUF!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-29 00:29:53	@PerfectChaos_x its okay. You'll get it one day. Aren't your sweets sweeter than ours? You have that! :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-29 00:43:33	@PissedOffBiotic Same. I want to try, but I feel like it's moot. Most of the women I try to hook up with are all about vanity. :/
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-27 17:22:34	Sad day is sad. No more Silent Hill. Welp, here's to hoping something else comes out of this cancelation...

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-27 19:09:31	Been a while since I drew. I think I've gotten better? [+5 to Art]
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-27 19:10:51	Just want to get home and watch Game of Thrones and Silicon Valley. Forgot to watch them last night...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-27 19:14:31	I have many talents, but talking to beautiful women and not saying something stupid is not one of them.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-29 00:47:18	@PissedOffBiotic So I've heard. We'll find our mates one day... even tho our mate is the same person (Natalie Dormer, ha)

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-27 21:52:53	@xlightthefuse thats when all the fun and excitement of bdays goes to shit. Unless you think renting a car at 25 is exciting, there's that.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-29 02:05:36	@ceae Yup. I wanna be the defender of the Moon!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-29 02:07:24	@TheMechromancer I'd still be your friend. I would laugh and point, but still a friend :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-04-27 22:55:44	I don't mind the Five Night's series. If anything, I like the story behind it. It's pretty damn good.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-02 18:28:34	@PissedOffBiotic kinda glad Gamestop is slowly becoming a video game store than a video game seller. Just for those.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-02 18:52:06	@PissedOffBiotic ikr? Surprised me too. Glad they are going that route. So I can actually see the quality and size :D (that's what she said)

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 00:20:11	I'm pretty sure Batman VS Superman is going to be trash. I just home Suicide Squad doesn't follow suit...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 00:20:54	I feel like the costumes are okay, but having Will Smith in it... I'm not used to see him in that role :/
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 00:21:55	Let's just hope Suicide Squad doesn't eat the shitter like most DC Comic movies.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 00:24:18	BUTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT, I'm still looking forward to Mass Effect the Movie tho... if it's still happening. Might be a little harder tho.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 00:24:48	@PissedOffBiotic NO THEIR COUSINS AND THAT'S IT! END THE SHOW AND SEASON!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 00:25:41	Mass Effect seems harder to adapt to the movie due to the whole paragon and renegade. I guess the can take that out and just follow a side.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 00:26:12	Then there's DLC... and... Hmm... If it's still in production, I'll watch it still.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 00:29:20	@PissedOffBiotic You don't look into your cousins eye's with lust and passion? Huh... I have some explaining to do...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 00:31:49	Ugh... I have work tomorrow... I don't wanna deal with hormonal teens and adolescent children with aspergers  running around...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-03 02:04:33	So, Age of Ultron was pretty cool.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 00:46:26	@PissedOffBiotic It could be malware, it could be a bunch of shit being sent to google, or you might have to reset your router.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 00:46:55	So, this is Will Smith? I'm not too worried anymore. That looks bad ass. https://t.co/6YBHcrjzqQ
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 00:48:28	@PissedOffBiotic I doubt it's anything malicious unless you go out of your way to find porn in unsafe sites. But, I doubt you do that... &gt;.&gt;
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 01:00:44	Got bored with my name, so I changed it a bit. Yeaaaa boredom.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 01:07:15	@PissedOffBiotic Jeeze, The Porn Downloading Twins! Haha, try resetting it and see what happens. That's the best hotfix I can think of.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 01:17:38	Last night was a weird night. I saw WAYYYYY too many people from my high school... I didn't expect to see that many people...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 01:19:04	@ceae how'd your interview go?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-03 08:49:30	Sooooo... my friends super drunk and I'm staying at my other friends house due to my friend being super drunk.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-03 08:51:41	Fun night nonetheless. Got a bit tipsy. Haven't felt that way in awhile. Had some hot chicks talk to me too, so, good night haha.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 01:30:00	@ceae Aww damn! Ce-Ce bout to see if she gets a better job! Woo!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 05:21:17	@TheMechromancer o.o; I haven't watched it yet... Don't know if this is feels or that it was a bad episode...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-05 07:17:24	@TheMechromancer It's not chub! It's... extra awesomeness...? :D? I just hope everyone else will do well. Looking at Leto and Smith...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 17:17:41	I'm bored... work is boring. Boreddddd.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 17:47:24	I wish something awesome would happen... RIIIIIIIIIGGGHHHHTTTTTTT NOW!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 17:48:29	And.... nothing happened...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 18:14:06	Add a message to your video http://t.co/ZIjzJIDv49
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 07:37:55	I liked a @YouTube video from @triplekyun http://t.co/zqTmd0FSVB Blumenkanye - Kanye West vs. Cyua
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 19:22:47	Is work over yet? https://t.co/s5xl7BxOTQ
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 19:26:09	May the fuck be with you. I mean 4th... https://t.co/hNgpESX7JX
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 13:29:40	Let's start the morning right. #TheLegendofZelda #OrcarinaofTime #Nintendo #N64 https://t.co/rO509CHmnq
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 13:35:14	@TheMechromancer hey, what's your opinion on the Suicide Squad movie? Especially about HQ and The Joker?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 13:45:09	@TheMechromancer I'm impressed with the Harley Quinn look. A lot better than I expected. A lot. And the Joker... same. They try to make him
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 13:45:58	@TheMechromancer more edgier than he really is. The Joker has some class even if it's a comedic class. I feel like the movie as a whole will
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 13:47:14	@TheMechromancer be decent and when I saw Will Smith, I was somewhat impressed with his costume. Hopefully he can live up to the character.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 13:54:50	@TheMechromancer Yep to both. Beside of The Dark Knight Trio, i feel like this may be DC Comics decent movie. Batman vs Superman looks... eh
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 14:01:12	@TheMechromancer Ah yes, Khal Drogo, the man who feared the sea and now ruler of the sea. Seems fitting haha. WW looks amazing. But...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 14:02:51	@TheMechromancer I think doing an Injustice movie would be better. And I love the Injustice series. Would've been better than BvS.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-04 14:27:45	.................................... fuck .................... Game of........... Thrones............
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-05 05:24:43	@ceae how'd you like the new video? huehuehue
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-05 05:35:28	@ceae Do you wanna play next weekend or do you need more time? I miss hearing your BEAUTIFUL voice :3
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-05 05:36:49	@ceae Okay. Just asking. If you don't, I understand. I should be on and not drinking... I think...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-05 06:43:15	@TheMechromancer totally agree haha
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-05 06:48:15	@TheMechromancer It's because people are stupid and dumb and dumb. She looks amazing. You gonna cosplay dat :D?!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-05 16:06:43	Don't know if I should go to this league conventipn that's not that far away from where I live...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-05 16:16:46	I hate asking people on my facebook about coming to a Con with me seeing how the majority of them don't play video games :/
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 03:03:02	New 6-Part Digimon movie. Huh. Looks pretty cool. I miss some digimon :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 03:12:38	I'm glad I have allergies. It gives me an excuse to not do things with people I hate :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 03:15:18	Time to play some Dragon Age Inquisition and repost a shit ton on tumblr cause that's what I do at night.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 03:15:59	And Origin crashed... -.-;
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 03:20:28	There's an update for DAI and I can't play it cause I have pleb internet... Unless...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 03:21:23	Nope... even going offline is stopping me QnQ
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 03:30:06	Ran in the rain today. Probably won't do it again. I hate the feeling of wet clothes. Would've rather ran naked but didn't want anyone 2 die
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 03:32:38	@ceae Still... wet clothes... &gt;.&lt;
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 03:36:59	@ceae I guess... but... MEHHHHHHHHHHHH!

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 03:53:12	@TheMechromancer Np! I really can't say I understand your problem, but I'll do what I can to help!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 04:07:53	I just want to play DAI... Origin pls...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 04:08:26	Gotta wait an hour... What to do...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 04:08:42	@PerfectChaos_x Alcoholic cider and pizza...?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-06 01:39:55	And on this day, I was reminded that I should save files more often...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 04:11:27	@PerfectChaos_x pizza is always a must. May you enjoy your melted golden cheese across your baked bread as it melts in your mouth.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 04:11:38	Fuck... I want pizza now...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 04:15:03	@PerfectChaos_x I would want that plus onions. That's all I usually get when I get pizza.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 04:16:20	I acquired a pizza! Well, a mini pizza, but PIZZA NO LESS!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 04:34:17	I need to watch Psych pass (I think I that's what it's called) and finish Tokyo Ghoul. I've been seeing a lot of posts lately.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 04:38:02	I AM THOR! FEAR MY THUNDER!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 04:45:16	I forgot I had a match . com page. I... I should do something with that...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 04:46:48	Messing with Google translate is funny.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 04:59:08	@Pearcour The usual response is "I have a boyfriend."
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 05:02:58	@Pearcour Maybe she doesn't know who Spider-Man is and she got it ironically. Sorry that happened bro.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-06 03:48:47	@BackupFruit Why is this a thing... It should burn and die.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 05:09:36	@Pearcour Saw that. Never heard of the "girlfriendzone" Weird... Ah well, hopefully, you dont meet rude people like her. But it's impossible
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 05:10:17	@TheMechromancer LOVE the hair! You got it on point!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 05:12:26	@TheMechromancer Ooo, man... I wish I had blonde hair so I could do that :/ But yeah, I can't wait to see the finished product!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-06 18:39:17	Every time I open my back account app, stram opens up... I think it's telling me something...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-06 21:04:19	Tempted to not exercise today. Too wet... huehuehue.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-06 21:56:25	Listening to some @katyperry while exercising in some light rain. Feels right.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-08 03:41:39	Keep forgetting I put a lock on my phone. Keep in swiping and it's locking me out -.-
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-08 04:38:41	So... that TSM vs SKT K1.... that game was.... umm... yeah... #MSI2015 #LeagueOfLegends
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 21:23:30	I want to make another Qunari, but I want to make it a female cause they look awesome and cause I never saw a female Qunari.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 22:09:24	The day ends as the sun glistened on my tanned skin. https://t.co/zaZrwiFtYB
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 22:43:36	I will main Lux. Just for this. https://t.co/vBzDeFOTCX
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 22:46:50	Can't wait to get home. Just want to finish DAI so I can replay it with a different story....
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 23:25:58	I remember wanting to play Leisure Suit Larry because of boobs.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 23:27:14	@LilyPichu Looks a bit gray...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-07 23:28:22	I feel like Origin has more frequent sales compared to steam...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-09 00:59:23	@PerfectChaos_x Good! It's trash. Have you seen BO3? That's just Activision milking BO for money.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-09 01:02:49	@PerfectChaos_x Good for you... ugh... What you playing now a days?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-09 01:04:58	Ugh... too hot in this house... I'm all sweaty QnQ
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-09 01:10:56	Times like this is when I wish it was winter...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-09 02:56:45	Killed another dragon! #DAI
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-09 03:17:06	@PissedOffBiotic That's what all drunk people say... DRUNKY!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-09 04:13:04	Smite seems to be playing fine, but League is being a little bitch QnQ
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-08 23:41:58	Saw a person's butt today which reminded me of an old friend. Weird how the oddest things remind of stuff.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-09 00:54:19	@PerfectChaos_x *cough* Markiplier *cough*
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-09 00:56:27	@PerfectChaos_x What happens if he gets married before then?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-09 00:58:10	@PerfectChaos_x You do play CoD, so I guess you don't mind it haha.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-09 03:32:26	I want hard cider. It makes me feel like an adult and child at the same time.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-09 03:48:40	Uhh... so my client keeps on dc'ing for #LeagueofLegends ... My internet and ping is fine... but League continues to disconnect..
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-09 20:48:08	MercTingTing just went 9/0/7 as LeBlanc on Summoner's Rift #LeagueOfLegends http://t.co/637L5ZvRYt Fuck that Zed laughed in lane &amp; got rekt
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-09 22:13:13	Today has been a chill day. And I never use the word chill... What's wrong with me... o.o;
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-10 05:34:57	First YouTube music video I saw ever. Yes. 

https://t.co/3qjvftu4bA
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-10 06:28:07	@Rachelkipster I plan to get the same one! :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-10 01:13:57	So, Hades support isn't really that good. It's very situational imo. But, it got the job done when paired up with a Poseidon. #Smite
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-10 02:11:27	Playing with a 4 man premade... this could go either really good or really bad... fingers crossed... #LeagueofLegends
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-10 02:41:25	Damn. @lolCrumbz 's hair game is on point! #MSI2015 #LeagueOfLegends
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-11 18:06:17	Fuck Mondaysssssssssssssssssssssssssssss! (~￣▽￣)~
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-11 19:12:25	I wish there was a 12 hour break between sunday and monday. Like a half day to get ready for the week after an awesome weekend.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-11 19:17:43	League of Legends | Ep. 114 - Reunited: http://t.co/AphzZ04M1H via @YouTube
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-11 21:43:37	I did it! Ran a full lap without stopping!  Accomplished! Now slowly dying.... ack! Halp!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-11 22:09:54	Saw a cute girl running today. As usual, I smiled and waved and she hit me in the nuts. (Lel, jk, would be funny if she actually did.)
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-11 23:00:27	@PissedOffBiotic I'm watching it right nowwww (~￣▽￣)~
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-11 23:06:23	I love my some Pod. He's amazing.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-11 23:46:27	And on this day, Ser Jorah Mormot returned into good favor with Merc.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-11 02:37:49	"A pussy is better than hand." - From a drunk female friend giving me dating/sex advice.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-12 03:35:04	Gonna give FFXIV another chance. Beta wasn't fun when I played it, so I never invested in it. It's cheap now, so it wouldn't hurt to try.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-12 05:01:51	That moment where it's nice to have a geeky/nerdy conversation with a person after having to speak about normal stuff all day.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-12 05:02:42	Like, I can't express my nerdiness during work... No one gets me QnQ Cept for one. But still!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-11 06:20:05	Saw a picture 7 years ago... Damn my hair game was on point!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-12 22:10:52	So, it seems i can run .44 miles without stopping. Let's see if I can keep this up to a mile... doubt it, but I have nothing better to do.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-12 22:12:12	Chilling in the car. So... nice and cold... (~￣▽￣)~ https://t.co/Qzj4KxQHqE
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-13 05:35:18	Jeezeeeee. Killing dragons give you some much experience... O.O
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-13 05:58:18	I want the weekend to come faster -.-; I'm so done with this week... well, with work at least.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-14 22:50:50	Getting to the point in life where my news from friends is either: "We're/I'm getting married!" Or "I'm having a baby!"
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-14 22:53:02	I miss, "Got [something new and/or shiny]! Let's do something with it!" Was news. Especially with games. :/
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-14 22:55:03	Bored... just lurking twitter for something fun and interesting pops up.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-14 22:58:20	Huh... I'd watch it. #TheLonelyIslandMovie http://t.co/IOUigY6qFV

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-14 03:15:24	I feel like I should had a profile pic with my gaming headset and be sexy... Getting the headset will be a challenge...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-14 03:34:14	@PerfectChaos_x Someone say nudes? Hello. ;D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-13 02:26:08	I don't like when I have to pay to get a picture with someone famous... makes me feel like they aren't human :/
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-14 06:03:58	It's almost the weekend :DDDDDDDDDDDDD

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-14 06:08:56	And less responsibility. Having less responsibility is a good thing too.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-14 06:20:02	Huh... Well, I hope Link has fun doing something else...I feel like a lot of bridges have been burned? Like... charred.. I dunno.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-15 17:02:09	I took the day off so I can play more with @ceae later :3
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-15 17:02:28	And also that I needed one since I never do take days off.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-15 17:17:02	@ceae it's patching. I'll be on around 12, your time, if you're done with mum and eerands.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-15 17:27:03	@ceae well, whenever you get on, i should be on around 12.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-16 03:41:34	I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/nhQxxChL8G AK &amp; LYNX ft Veela - Virtual Paradise [M/V]
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-14 21:59:23	Might get a new graphics card soon. These hi-res games are going to blownup my computer without a proper upgrade...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-14 22:04:33	Triss Merigold. Just cause she's awesome and that Witcher 3 is coming. http://t.co/LGLnKHadsC
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-15 19:59:37	My friend got this for me as a late bday present :3 #HarleyQuinn https://t.co/emD4xrpbUv

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-15 05:45:06	It wouldn't be out of the ordinary with this weather....
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-15 05:45:37	But I do like money... But I do love playing video games more...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-15 05:50:40	Fuck it... let's see where FFXIV ARR is while I sleep and I'll make my decision then...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-15 05:59:16	@SkyWilliamsTho here you go sky. http://t.co/8TyppsPbmg

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-16 12:09:57	...It's too early for this shit. I don't see how people wake up this early to do things...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-16 12:12:00	Fuck it... after I do some of these quests, I'm going back to sleep. -.- zzz
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-16 15:47:08	@ceae no i fell asleep. Alarmed my butthole. Got up. Hit the window. Did prologue. Fell back asleep. :c

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-19 05:44:42	If only romancing real people were this easy -.-;
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-19 05:54:36	Huh... I think this is the first time I ever saw actual boobs in a Dragon Age game. Nice. /self bro fist
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-18 21:41:40	Motivation for running is at a low... o(╥﹏╥)o
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-19 02:56:55	Dear @ceae ,

You're a butt.

Love, Merc
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-19 03:15:03	@ceae typical white mage for ya. Spouting out nonsense. Tsk tsk.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-19 03:21:29	Dragon Age Inquisition has got me waiting for hours before I can continue to do anything else fun. Touché DAI... Touché....
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-19 03:21:59	@ceae Lalafels are creepy as fuck...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-19 03:22:32	It's not a bad thing. It gives me time to play other games. I guess...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-19 03:44:18	@ceae sure.... &gt;.&gt;;
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-19 03:53:05	Huh... finally died in FFXIV... fuck
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-19 22:04:11	Good run today me! The weather was bearable compared to yesterday! (~￣▽￣)~

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-19 22:28:53	@DooplissSuplex this could be us son. Let me serenade you with my recorder like one of my french sons.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-19 22:44:59	I want to start a petition to change America's national anthem to Guile's theme song.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-20 02:26:34	Things I want to do right now: pick a few essential things and go on an adventure!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-20 02:27:15	If only adventurers still existed and guilds. That'd be cool.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-20 02:29:45	Or space flight or traveling has progressed a 1000 years where traveling to different planets and meeting different species is a thing.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-20 02:30:20	I just want to go on an adventure! щ(ಠ益ಠщ)
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-20 03:29:20	The Hissing Wastes is the most terrible place in Orlais... I never want to go back...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-20 20:30:43	Didn't realize there were so many "shout" commentators in YouTube. Then again, I don't browse outside my comfort zone.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-20 04:31:54	All... that... just for shitty equipment... o(╥﹏╥)o
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-19 22:11:27	@DooplissSuplex no problem son. I miss your face.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-20 02:23:50	I wish I was a good writer or good with words. I'm like Cassandra when it comes with words.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-21 02:33:40	@PissedOffBiotic it was me and Blackwall against 4 Pride demons and all I hear is Dorian and Sera talking...

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-21 02:41:55	DAI has me waiting 3 hours for my council to search shit for me. Guess I'll finish some areas.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-21 05:10:24	I love Triss and her red hair. I want her (´･∩ ･` )

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-20 21:38:54	I wonder if character designers draw the gentials for every character and then have them rendered into 3d models or do they make everyone
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-20 21:54:41	Nice weather, nice workout, and hopefully nocenfood afterward!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-20 21:59:34	No nice food. Have to settle with fast foods.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-20 22:21:15	I like going back to tumblr after a week break. Reason being is that there's a lot more new things I can reblog becuase I'm uncreative.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-20 21:24:02	Staying fit sucks dickkkkkkkkkkk!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-20 21:25:10	@PissedOffBiotic Miranda. It's been genetically modified to be the best.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-20 22:53:59	I wonder if making Cole more human is a good idea... if Varric says it's okay...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-21 18:40:19	@nerohkun that's like $15 to $20 here.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-21 18:41:18	@nerohkun do you collect or play or both or none?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-21 18:42:59	One more day till the weekend! :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-21 18:43:36	Also, new video should be going up in like an hour or two!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-21 19:01:44	@nerohkun true. I usually just buy like 10 or 20 when the new set comes out.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-21 19:05:17	@nerohkun Lucky gril. Next tell her to buy you a lottery ticket or enter a sweepstakes.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-21 19:06:18	My butt hurts. Like, the cheeks. All this running is making me butt hurt... (¬‿¬)
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-21 20:09:25	Played against a Priest who thought he got the win with his Rag. But, he holy nova'd himself to get fatigued. GG. #Hearthstone

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-21 22:21:44	When and if I get married, my bride needs to be okay with our wedding music. It's gonna be video game music. Most of it. Maybe all...

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-22 19:52:48	Hmm... are the Batman: Arkgam series worth playing? Need some input before I buy all the ones before the next game comes out.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-23 19:50:52	@PissedOffBiotic Well, good luck. The combo system to wonky to me. That... no... I like The Witcher 2 more. Plus, Triss is hotter in 2. :3

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-22 19:52:00	@PissedOffBiotic that's what happens when you have steam. You buy some many games for sale, you forget you have them.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-23 01:15:16	Are goths still a thing? I feel like they died in the '90s?

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-26 22:08:00	Hmm... what to do once I get home? Not much... huh...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-26 22:36:45	@PerfectChaos91x well, bears in skyrim are assholes anyways. He had it coming...

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-26 23:51:18	Square Enix... why is my account being suspicious? Is it selling drugs again? I just don't want to change my password... again...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-26 23:52:42	@PissedOffBiotic Get oneeeeeeeeeeeeeee! So, we can play games together :D And also, they are nice :3
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 00:01:14	@nhales80 I like the bed :D
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 00:01:58	@PissedOffBiotic Whenever you do, just hit me up on steam :D And good luck with the credit card stuff!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 00:06:36	@PissedOffBiotic I do have steam! and the shitty stupid cousin, Origin. I only use it for DA2 and DAI. Only reason I have it...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 00:07:26	@PissedOffBiotic And steam seems to be down, but I will add you! I am MercTingTing if you get a request!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 00:08:10	@nhales80 Still, it's a nice looking bed. Do you game on that? Or do you have a desk coming?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 00:10:18	@nhales80 Really? Nicesuuuuuuu. What kind is it? Alien or some other laptop that I can't think of...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 00:20:30	@nhales80 Ahh nice. Well, congrats on moving in safely!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 01:58:44	Damnnnnnnnnn. That DAI DLC... the ending had me like... http://t.co/VSGZIf0S3F
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 02:00:19	@PissedOffBiotic Big fan question: DA or ME?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 02:16:07	@PissedOffBiotic at this point, I think I like DA over ME. Never got attached to my Shep. He was just the standard male Shep.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 02:16:38	@PissedOffBiotic but for DA, i got to make new characters every time! And I love them all cause they are all so unique.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 01:33:39	For those who haven't played the Jaws of Hakkon DLC for DAI, do it. It's fucking amaz-balls.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 02:42:23	@PissedOffBiotic Ahh... yeah... me and my shep didn't connect that way. My Qunari was kinda Bi. Banged Cass, but flirted with Ironbull a bit
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 02:43:53	@PissedOffBiotic but good for you by having a character to help you open :D That's pretty cool. Interesting way to find you're bi or...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 02:44:34	@PissedOffBiotic i don't know the politcally correct term... not quite up to date with the right way to say... things... and stuff...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 02:58:02	Hmm... What should I put on this mix CD? Some of dem summer hits, ya?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 03:10:14	@PissedOffBiotic Sw33t! I didn't sounds like an asshole :D but yeah, I'm loving DA right now. The replay value, for me, is endless!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 03:11:01	I hate when Itunes duplicates your music and then you have to hand pick the duplicates and delete them... my night...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 03:12:19	That moment when you remember that Chris Evans was in Not Another Teen Movie. http://t.co/Gr85PWTjWK
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 19:49:27	This is making my body all.... meh... I feel like a Hanar...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 20:48:17	I love @prattprattpratt 's instagram. He ❤ BJ!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 21:28:26	Fuck this humid... WEAHTERRRRRRRRRR~🎵
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-27 21:50:17	I can see clearly now the rain is gone. https://t.co/3wkx63bpUo
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 00:45:03	Oil rogue is probably the most fun deck I've played. Like, damn. #Hearthstone
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 01:14:57	WTF?! These Orlesian nobles are rude as fuck! I get a -25 approval cause I'm a Qunari and this one bitch talks slow to me... Imma cut a bish
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 20:27:41	DAO theme, Leliana's Song, is beautiful and serene! I would probably have that as a wedding song.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 20:36:12	I liked a @YouTube video from @DurealFirali http://t.co/4hEICV1KSX Dragon Age: Origins - Main Theme
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 20:36:38	https://t.co/LMnW1grSbc

This is just a great song/score/theme. #DragonAgeOrigins
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 20:42:29	I think I might stream my wedding haha. I have friend all over the world and it'd be nice for them to see the wedding :3
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 20:43:41	But I'm single and it won't be any time soon... so... SINGLE LIFEEEEEE! BOOZE! BOOBZ! GAMING! NETFLIX! SLEEPING! ALONE... in the dark...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 02:08:53	Okay. Game. I'm allied where ever Morrigan sides!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 03:24:16	I think it's finally time to replay Bioshock Infinite.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 03:25:51	I say this because I just played the most annoying quest in DAI... I had to talk to random nobles and find shit... I hate those...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 21:02:59	@ceae I hope the interview went/goes well!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 21:13:29	@ceae was it for an insurance company?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 21:19:31	@ceae funfunfunfunfun. How about tomorrow? I think you said you had another interview?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 21:20:49	Gonna go run... yey... (´･∩ ･` )

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 19:38:34	If I had to pick between the DA universe or the ME universe, I'd probably pick Dragon Age.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 19:39:06	As much as I would love space travel, I rather have magical powers than biotics.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 19:50:51	I want to go to E3 one year... just once... maybe twice... but yeah... (´･∩ ･` )
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 20:00:02	I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/VkqTzyb6Mc Dragon Age: Inquisition - Main Theme [Extended]
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-28 20:22:52	Dragon Age and Mass Effect have the best themes imo.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-29 03:55:28	I just had to give judge to a corpse in a box... what is this game? Haha #DAI

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-05-30 21:03:39	@PerfectChaos91x I can't imagine myself rapping that fast. Only a true Rap God spit rhymes that fast.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-03 21:37:07	@PerfectChaos91x When in doubt... What would Nadeshot do...?
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-03 21:39:08	@PerfectChaos91x Yes. Do so and live as a somewhat legend! May the people remember your struggles in Kill Confirmed.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-05 03:05:28	Ugh... is it worth doing all the War Table stuff in DAI? I want to play it, but i have nothing else to do.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-05 03:06:06	I've done all side quests. And i don't know if waiting hours for everything is worth it.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-05 05:10:16	I disappointed a lot of people today in DAI. Got some of it back tho. Still... seeing all those disapproval messages... It got me in the &lt;3

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-15 03:32:15	I need to get into E3 once... i want free loot...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-13 15:53:55	I thought it looked cool. https://t.co/DAlQQAEd13
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-15 18:13:09	I'm never impressed by XBOX's presentation. It's the same every year: Forza, rebooted game, Halo, indie games.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-15 18:15:38	It's probably cause I don't own an XBOX One. Ah well, still not impressed :P
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-15 18:20:23	@DooplissSuplex i jizzed so hard cause that's what video games is. Unf! I care so much about CARZ!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-15 18:38:34	Predictions of EA's presentation: SPORTSSS! WE LIKE SPORTS! WE ADDED ANOTHER SPORTS GAME! ALSO LOOK! NEW ASSASSINS CREED! ALSO SPORTSSSSSS!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-15 21:33:25	Soooo.... Mass Effect Andromeda is the only thing I liked and I hope it isn't shit. EA pls...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-15 21:34:46	So I kinda predicted EA's presentation. There were too many sports!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-16 18:11:51	Don't know if I should buy FFXIII... i played it before but never finished it... send halp
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-16 20:14:15	@PerfectChaos91x I'm sad that jet packs are still a thing... what happened to ol' fashioned running? QnQ
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-16 20:16:35	@PissedOffBiotic wtf?!

...it's true.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-16 02:37:57	I don't care much about it. But that Final Fantasy 7 remake tho? Jizz. Made me forget that didn't show any Kingdom Hearts 3...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-16 02:39:12	Oh also Horizon looks god damn awesome! I need to get a PS4 QnQ
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-16 20:30:30	Still thinking if I should give FF13 a chance...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-15 23:15:45	Ubisoft did well. Glad Aisha Tyler is still their spokesperson. Can't wait for The Division. Game looks damn good.
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-16 23:40:02	@PissedOffBiotic so hawt... going to his place in a few... this time I'm going to break up with him once and for all!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-17 00:08:50	@PissedOffBiotic just came back... my ass is plesantly sore. He rammed me with HD trailers of Cloud's sword, FF15 trailers, and...
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-17 00:09:30	@PissedOffBiotic finished a huge load of KH3 gameplay on my face... it... it was nice... I mean... I'm going to break up with him next time!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-17 00:12:37	@PissedOffBiotic out of context and the lack of game titles, this would be an sexually awkward conversation. I love it!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-17 00:16:28	@PissedOffBiotic He's big enough for the two of us. Both sexually and figuratively. And also, sharing is caring! /hugz
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-16 18:22:57	Welp, caught the last bit of Square Enix's conference. Um.. so yeah. Didn't learn much cause it was the end but Seems like they showed KH3!
608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-16 18:23:13	So it's still in development! That's all i really cared about. Some of their new IP's look good tho.

608474877	MercTingTing	2015-06-18 19:41:13	Dragonball Z: Xenoverse is a fun game. Probably my favorite DBZ game since Burst Limit on the PS3.
