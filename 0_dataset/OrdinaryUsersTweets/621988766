621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-04-28 19:00:30	Sundays are an excuse to keel and nobody says a word to you. Yes
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-04-25 21:39:20	Just the thought of some people makes me shake in disgust and rage, therefore wanting to hurt their face. üëä
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-04-25 22:13:50	Is it wrong that I'm worried about myself? #weird

621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-05-09 16:53:56	Not a fan of this wind being a skinny little man, flying away.
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-05-11 14:13:07	I fucking despise my phone.
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-05-11 21:32:18	Only in Aberdare will you see somebody having a piss in the middle of the street. Rank.
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-05-11 21:40:29	It's not normal for anybody, let alone a girl to just decide to squat and have a piss in plain sight of everybody, in a street.. Why, wrong.
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-05-12 09:49:01	Do I get up and bring Natalie breakfast in bed... Hmmm.
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-05-13 15:54:25	Sitting in the car waiting to go into tesco amid this monsoon.
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-05-15 18:24:40	Going to spew all over Aberdare Saturday, brighten it up :-)

621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-08-31 11:34:55	A weekend down Tenby does sound appealing soon too. ‚òÄüç∫
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-08-31 11:35:58	@FootieWriter can you predict whether Herrera is on his way to Utd? Although I think ¬£25m is steep..

621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-09-02 21:25:54	Well done Arsenal on getting Ozil. Time for United to enjoy the Europa league I think. #shocker
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-09-01 21:18:15	‚Äú@ChurchOfFutbol: Most assists in the last 3 seasons:

1. Ozil -86.  
2. Messi-80 
3. Mata-66  
4. Ribery-55 
5. Hazard -52‚Äù @darccfc  he is
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-09-01 21:20:31	@darccfc doesn't get chances in the team he's in.. He's not a Madrid style player
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-09-01 21:23:46	Bale will just get better at Madrid, learning off Ronaldo and better service. 30+ goals a year consistently.
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-09-01 21:31:18	@rthepowerd we need him!
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-09-01 21:32:05	@darccfc @Lintafer on average was never allowed a full 90 under mourinho though, didn't get on. At arsenal I'd say 20+
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2013-08-30 06:56:53	It's FRIDAY! üôèüçªüéâ

621988766	MatthewLinton4	2014-02-27 17:42:22	RvP can do one if he thinks he's bigger than the club after a good season, child. Go back to Arsenal if you want, step in Hernandez.

621988766	MatthewLinton4	2014-06-04 19:41:44	This England team is embarrassing.
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2014-06-07 22:17:03	If this is England's starting 11, I'd consider throwing in the white towel now, or signing a few blind people up.
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2014-06-07 22:19:54	Rooney should retire, along with Johnson. Past it.

621988766	MatthewLinton4	2014-08-27 16:17:55	@IAmJoshua_ why do we want another left back for fuck sake?
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2014-08-26 17:55:05	@SodabarOfficial thanks for the amazing night out Sunday... Can't remember a thing. #messy
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2014-08-26 20:22:57	Jonny Evans and Michael Keane has been quite possibly the worst centre back partnership I have ever seen.
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2014-08-28 21:11:15	@Marniegshore and @HollyGShore are just outstanding... Get to Wales. Heelloo sweetie.
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2014-08-28 21:13:06	@Daniel_Fradd think so pal
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2014-08-26 20:29:31	This is fucking embarrassing
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2014-08-26 20:39:23	Never ever seen such a shambolic defence, can't even pass 5 yards. Dreadful. Hernandez and Welbeck have been dire too.
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2014-08-26 20:44:07	Imagine losing 4-0 to fucking MK Dons. Fuck off Jonny Evans, Michael Keane, Hernandez, Welbeck and Anderson.

621988766	MatthewLinton4	2014-08-31 10:55:12	@SherriiLeighx3 are you real?! NAAA. Cant do work on a blistering hangover, have one for me!
621988766	MatthewLinton4	2014-08-30 12:35:45	Our back 3 is causing us massive problems, look lost. Not linking with our midfield... Therefore no service for WR &amp; RVP.
