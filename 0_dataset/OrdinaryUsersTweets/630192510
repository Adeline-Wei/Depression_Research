630192510	ThamesPics	2015-03-24 22:28:54	@girlaboutthames did you hear a bang just then or my imagination?
630192510	ThamesPics	2015-03-24 22:29:36	@NarboroughL yep listening out for it, that may have been it... May not havd been hah
630192510	ThamesPics	2015-03-24 22:36:35	@girlaboutthames aw probably a false alarm then :) i've got window open waiting for a bang
630192510	ThamesPics	2015-03-24 22:46:15	Re last tweet... I'm leaning rather more towards random bang. Possibly next door's back gate :p

630192510	ThamesPics	2015-03-25 09:08:33	@BygoneMedway I knew it was coming but my reaction was "**** me!!!"
630192510	ThamesPics	2015-03-25 09:09:23	@se1 Judging by the massive bang and thud just then in Kent, I'd say the #bermondseybomb is no more!
630192510	ThamesPics	2015-03-25 09:09:40	@mandy_moooouk @BygoneMedway It changed
630192510	ThamesPics	2015-03-25 09:10:17	@Brazilyid Yep, the WWII bomb was brought down from London to be destroyed at Cliffe
630192510	ThamesPics	2015-03-25 09:10:38	@mandy_moooouk @BygoneMedway Yes that was the plan and it changed
630192510	ThamesPics	2015-03-25 09:11:53	@mandy_moooouk They planned to do it last night and then changed the schedule to do it this morning instead
630192510	ThamesPics	2015-03-25 09:35:12	@gumbojim @se1 Hopefully they made one, sounded incredible.

630192510	ThamesPics	2015-05-06 08:47:18	@balders18 Hard to say but assuming 3.30 time from RN means at Greenwich, probably about 2hr before that?
630192510	ThamesPics	2015-05-06 14:35:24	@jsstanton2910 guess shortly before 2 but +/- 30 min. best thing is to keep an eye on http://t.co/wgavg9mKAs. I'll try to tweet as she nears
