633078692	willgkelleher	2012-08-14 13:20:41	@twice_tyse1 Great. If you're happy we can always give out the blocks some publicity in @ExeposeSport. Probs better when term in full swing
633078692	willgkelleher	2012-08-14 13:48:18	@twice_tyse1 Well if you want to write a piece about it you're more than welcome. Or interview? Could even squeeze it in the fresh issue

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-04-30 09:56:54	Bloody hell this is big #5mins #Lions
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-04-30 10:42:47	Warburton a good #Lions captain? Not someone you would go to the gates of hell with. Not an inspirational figure. Please prove me wrong!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-04-30 10:45:12	Yes he's the captain of the best side but that all goes out of the window on a #lions tour. Wales don't win abroad. Excited for the tour tho
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-04-30 11:00:35	@allifradgley would have preferred to see someone who knows what It's all about like POC. Not sure wales have beaten Aus away for a while!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-04-30 12:06:30	@allifradgley yes we will wait and see! Close isn't good enough. Really looking forward to it. Should be a great series. #lions2013
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-04-30 12:31:54	@professorpeteh POC for passion or BOD just because!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-04-29 21:34:34	Word going round that @samwarburton_ has got the captaincy. Wouldn't be a surprise! Too excited for 11am tomorrow. #lionssquad #massive

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-05-05 09:21:34	@owenkeats probably some sort of massive error...
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-05-05 09:27:23	@owenkeats wild flailing of arms as the lack of sound dragon approaches in complete fiery silence, wouldn't want to be in there right now!

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-08 12:24:18	Looks like @TommyBowe14 is out with a broken hand. Very bad news for #Lions was looking sharp. Who to get the call now? Injury list growing

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-12 14:50:46	@Billy_12trees called up to @lionsofficial long journey for Mr.36! Good cover for 10,12,13 probs means Bowe not recovering #lions
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-11 09:14:57	I fear a cricket score here for the @lionsofficial Aim to keep them to 0 and work on combo and set piece probs! Might not be best exercise
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-11 10:58:49	Bit sloppy now from the Lions, Line-out not amazing too- Still things to work on for the tests! #Lions

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-18 09:40:14	Come on @lionsofficial big test today. No injuries please! #lions #BRUvLIO
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-18 10:03:02	Not the best start for @lionsofficial LO looking suspect, Wade nervous, Hogg faltering. @saundy8 could be a tricky one today! #lions
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-18 10:08:43	@saundy8 Lineout! Best's arrars not looking so sharp!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-18 10:14:14	@JoeCarlin1 @saundy8 should be alright because 12ers and Brad don't have a chance for Sat thankfully. Haven't actually noticed Barritt yet..

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-18 10:24:43	@saundy8 backing us to turn it around. But questionable half! Although no real test combos in there. MS looking especially fat today...
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-18 10:27:42	@JoeCarlin1 @Cotsyyy @saundy8 need some magic from Shane and Christian. A 2001 Robinson-esque burn from Wade would do v nicely.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-18 10:36:19	@saundy8 @JoeCarlin1 @Cotsyyy leave it 5. Will have got a rocket at ht. If no change then screw 'em. Gotta get the win! BB even on?

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-16 10:02:37	@saundy8 hadn't seen about Williams until now. That really is from left field! Clearly Bowe and North screwed. How's Ashton feeling now?!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-16 10:10:59	@saundy8 Also Brad Barritt snuck in there under the radar!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-18 10:38:05	@saundy8 Barritt
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-18 11:20:17	I suspect @lionsofficial have blown it here.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-18 11:25:52	Brumbies certainly deserved that. Many Lions destined for midweek honours after that performance. Surely will be v diff on sat. Let's hope!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-06-20 19:04:00	V. poor that there is no regard for Sport whatsoever in the @gdnstudentmedia awards categories! Essential part of student media disregarded

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-10 13:28:53	@tim_clews Australia 80/3 at close... #hearditherefirst
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-10 13:39:02	@tim_clews haha yeah exactly. Shows how pointless the whole #hearditherefirst brigade are! #claimoclock is another good one!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-10 14:30:56	Keep the faith kids. Remember Siddle got 6for at Brisbane 1st innings in 2010/11 and we all know what happened there #ashes
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-10 15:46:33	@tim_clews my #hearditherefirst isn't looking too bad. Probs fewer runs though. Not that worried that we're bowling atm #conduciveconditions
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-10 15:50:02	Here we go boys! 50/3 by close will do nicely!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-10 16:08:38	Have FAITH!! Watto far too aggressive early doors and cowan shocking shot. Good perseverance from Finn. We have the better attack! #jugular

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-10 16:13:31	Crowd involved... Ball swinging... Who wants to bat?? Keep the faith!! Love the ashes.

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-12 17:00:19	@JoeCarlin1 I think it shows an element of class to walk when you're out. Not sure what I'd do in the situ though. Bad aus reviews v costly!

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-21 15:15:01	Sorry that IS out. Screw hotspot you can hear it!!! Can't have hit anything else! Well done Tony Hill. Logic prevails
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-21 15:19:45	Why can't we go on the OBVIOUS sound? Hotspot isn't perfect. And anyway I can see a faint hotspot- why can't anyone else?
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-21 15:21:13	Please can someone tell me what the noise is then other than bat on ball?? Someone got a coin in their pocket?Fielders clicking fingers??
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-21 15:36:38	Poor umpiring however is correct call. No one could have complained if Erasmus had given it out originally as so obviously a massive noise!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-21 15:37:51	RT â@Aggerscricket: As we have always said: no mark on Hotspot doesnât mean not out. Clear mark on Hotspot does mean outâ EXACTLY!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-21 15:40:10	@Aggerscricket thank you for talking sense re Agar when all your colleagues are falling about missing the point!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-21 15:45:51	There's your reprieve Australia. Root being generous. This is pathetic from a great sporting nation. Embarrassing. 8 tests left...
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-21 16:20:39	@Dougie_Wilson 8th time he'll finish in the top 3 of a major without winning one. King choker I'd say... Harsh but true
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-21 17:33:20	@Benedict_B  What's the average 10th wicket partnership in this series so far?
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-19 17:08:48	And I was right. KP you are SO unreliable. You've got 25 mins to survive?!! Keeps doing this as well. Utter cock
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-19 17:12:34	The thing that makes KP so bloody annoying is he doesn't learn! He'll go and get a 100 at Old Trafford now but come on!! So predictable
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-19 17:16:40	No application from the out batsmen other than Bell in this game. It not even great bowling. Both side giving wickets away
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-18 17:38:05	What a tool Broad is. Sending Jimmy out there for you??Have always hated night watchmen but this is ridiculous. If you're good enough, bat!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-22 07:37:42	@MC_2xP did you fall asleep again?
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-22 07:52:17	@MC_2xP smells like bullshit from here..

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-19 13:15:34	There was a tiny mark on the bat for Hughes. Could no one else in the commentary box see that? And anyway an obvious noise! Good decision.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-20 21:49:55	@JonJenner YES! Get more BublÃ© on there at least!My only choice at the moment is Your Song, there's only so many times you can nail a song..

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-27 17:46:42	@WOTcricket 3s 97 all out. Lost by 170. #theonlywayisup!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-27 20:56:40	Does anyone else find Greg James really unfunny? And 'Not Just Cricket' really average apart from the Swann and Anderson bits? No..just me?
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-27 21:02:04	@Dougie_Wilson he can't interview people. Asks too many unrelated questions in a row. Guess we notice cos people like Aggers are so good!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-27 21:04:45	@Dougie_Wilson I feel James would be more suited to a Saturday shitathon on ITV than 5 live. Hope he doesn't get the fighting talk gig
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-27 21:08:49	@Simosloth Should stick to Radio 1. I don't listen to radio 1. Also as with literally everyone I'm indifferent when it comes to Marmite...

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-07-27 21:10:22	@Simosloth @Dougie_Wilson Well then get a sports guy to do it. I know Swann and Jimmy asked him to do but meh he's crap

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-08-02 17:44:40	@tom_bond @ajwilliams1991 why send out a worse batsman to do your job? Batsmen should back themselves and be good enough to survive 20 mins!

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-08-25 15:26:57	If we amazingly won now I assume Warne would congratulate Australia for losing heroically 'the right way'...

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-08-25 15:32:31	I'd love to see us go for this but if say 20-3 it seems Warne would prefer his side to be all out for 80 than batting for the draw and 3-0!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-08-25 15:35:04	@warne888 what happens if Eng are 20-3 going for it? Would you prefer them to be 80 all out or get the draw 3-0? The former wd be mindless!?

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-11 19:42:10	@FredBoycott well done Zaf. Learnt to #digin and #plodon on the dodgy wickets of @HamptonSchool . Proper stuff.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-15 15:27:49	@officialecfc what time should I come up on Tuesday? Around 11 would suit me. I can't DM you back because you don't follow me I think.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-15 16:51:44	@OfficialECFC cool. See you then.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-18 15:36:33	@FranoAnnandale  I have been all day!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-18 08:54:30	@Exepose We've only gone and been shortlisted for @mediaguardian Student Publication if the Year! Awesome. #exepose #top5inthecountry
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-20 23:23:03	@TomEPPayne @LouisAlexDore @JonJenner the song choices are awful Payne-o. Ridiculous!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-25 14:56:23	Research done. Live Text ready. Stop watches, tally counters and dictaphone ready. I'm 3 1/2 hours early.. Let's do this!! #TownVsGown
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-25 21:39:17	Wow that was frantic. For the first ever live text we've done I think was OK!? Now to trawl through thousands of photos! Long day tomorrow
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-26 06:08:37	7 hours later and I'm up. Off to edit the pages all day today. Could be a long one. Our work starts now! #TownVsGown #editingmarathon
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-26 23:21:26	Marathon 16 1/2 hr editing session complete. For my sanity please pick up an @exepose on Tuesday. Some seriously flair stats @LouisAlexDore
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-28 11:40:44	@Simosloth @XpressionFM Are you joking Simon!?? Steenson is so average! Have you seen Evans, Ford, Farrell and Burns play?!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-28 11:53:00	@Simosloth deluded!! How is he second? He only gets the a lot of points because he doesn't get international caps and stays fit. Just solid.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-28 12:09:51	@Simosloth Evans, Farrell and Burns aren't erratic. Farrell is dull but the others v v exciting and have the complete package.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-28 13:41:29	Hopefully @BTSport @BTCare have sorted the online streaming for laptops before @QuinsRugbyUnion v @Saracens Missed most of Spurs game
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-28 14:18:30	@MikeStanton1992 @Saracens @QuinsRugbyUnion you're on.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-28 14:18:59	@BTCare yeah lots. Working fine now though. Let's hope it lasts!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-28 14:19:41	@MikeStanton1992 @Saracens @QuinsRugbyUnion bt on the telly. Leeeave it.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-28 16:10:45	What makes this @QuinsRugbyUnion result worse is that I now owe @MikeStanton1992 a pint. Bollocks.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-09-28 22:05:57	Half an hour in and still can't work out the top of Martinez' shirt. Is it a roll neck? Collar? Mini scarf!? So deceptive... #MOTD
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-02 09:08:35	@followthethings Very interesting. Different company same problems. The plot thickens...
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-02 10:18:18	.@SouthAsiaCorro may have just exploded my dissertation... awful but compelling @followthethings #Followtherugbyball http://t.co/fDjxZ1HgXn
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-02 14:13:34	@followthethings in a good way! Some new avenues to pursue now after that article was published. Maybe the wrong choice of word in hindsight
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-03 17:25:17	@KleinonF1 @MatthewBugler you don't get paid? #awkward
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-05 16:22:05	Seems that @LFC and @QuinsRugbyUnion just can't be good at the same time! Come on guys. Coordinate!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-06 10:37:09	New #followtherugbyball post up 'Packing down with the professionals' @exetergeography @followthethings  http://t.co/A7IrHCOk58
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-05 16:26:19	This SA v NZ match is UNBELIEVABLE. SO much talent everywhere. Is anyone having a bad game!?
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-10 06:29:39	Just about light now. On the way to the office. Must be about time for #editingThursday
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-11 18:56:23	Wow. Montenegro's anthem inspires fear. Feel like Javert and Darth Vader are going to walk out...
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-12 16:40:49	Soo many basic errors; missed tackles, dropped balls, breakdown pens but flashes of quality. Need to sort the season out! @QuinsRugbyUnion
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-12 16:46:55	Maybe @QuinsRugbyUnion victims of over-performing in recent seasons so our expectations are too high? Been some tough opening fixtures mind
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-12 16:42:58	What do we reckon's going on @RugbyQuins ? So many basic mistakes! Some good stuff but basics poor. Stoop losing it's aura. #madmaxeffect ?
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-13 10:52:31	Excited to see some @lionsofficial players in the flesh @SandyParkExeter today. Can @ExeterChiefs make home advantage count? #chiefs
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-13 12:22:04	Currently live tweeting for @ExeposeSport @SandyParkExeter what is going on. Chiefs amazing. Blues awful!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-13 12:47:13	Â£5.25 for this is a little much but hey I've watched @ExeterChiefs run in 5 tries before HT for free! http://t.co/I1G4Bef8Mp
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-13 12:50:19	Didn't realise all of Wales were playing... It's not helping them. http://t.co/k4onAdsh2b
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-13 13:38:07	Superb first half from the Chiefs- blew Cardiff away. You can have 5 lions in the team but doesn't make you any good at defending it seems!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-13 13:49:39	@Dougie_Wilson I was so shocked! Expected Cardiff to do a job on them today. Chiefs certainly maturing
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-13 14:48:16	This is dreamy rugby from Toulon. Obscene.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-14 14:03:06	@zoebulaitis @BMurphie @TomEPPayne @eleanorsteafel yey! And if we win come back and party!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-14 10:11:35	For those who didn't see here are the @SouthAsiaCorro articles collated on my blog http://t.co/1nlrkVtYVf @ExeterGeography @followthethings
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-14 12:41:24	@zoebulaitis @TheTabExeter Just yes Zoe.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-14 12:53:42	@zoebulaitis gone green! All good though. Lots of proper reporters now and reporting on loads of Uni stuff! Covering it all! When're #GMAs?

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-18 12:40:33	@JimmyGreenShop Hi! If you want to buy ad space on the sport pages you'll have to email editors[at]http://t.co/7LsnthYEwM for deets. Thanks!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-18 14:56:29	@JimmyGreenShop ok if you could email sport@exepose.com then we can sort something out I'm sure. Thanks.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-18 18:29:54	Let's make this clear. It seems @Saracens haven't sold 50,000 tickets they've hired in a choir to fill the first four rows of every stand!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-19 15:28:32	Off to see ex- @FootlightsUoE stalwart @K_Glover258 in @BakewellBakeoff tonight! Break all your legs!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-18 20:53:29	@MikeStanton1992 such a shame..
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-18 20:57:14	@MikeStanton1992 haha. You can't win the tight ones and we can't win full stop. Team with more intent won. Deserved.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-18 21:04:57	@MikeStanton1992 I'll leave you to wallow. Maybe prepare the quins bating tweet for Sunday now. Hoping for a good one when we lose!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-18 21:05:51	@TingTong_AD @MikeStanton1992 also lost to Ulster last week sooo... #whytakenoteofimperfection
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-18 21:10:32	@MikeStanton1992 @TingTong_AD how loose at home where you TT? Bosting MS!? #mikestillcantspell #editor
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-18 21:13:35	@MikeStanton1992 @TingTong_AD right... Need to keep your standards up Michael. Focussing on rugby you still lost. Oops #ropeyspelling+result
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-18 21:16:33	@TingTong_AD @MikeStanton1992 if you read before I have accepted that baring miracles we ain't winning on sun! #clermontdontloseathome
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-18 21:18:06	@MikeStanton1992 @TingTong_AD I'm looking forward to a very strong Sunday post-quins-loss tweet from you Mike. No pressure! #48hrstoprepare
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-18 21:20:43	@MikeStanton1992 @TingTong_AD *to. Again. Poor. ð You've done one every quins  loss so far- why break the trend you began??
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-18 21:21:40	@MikeStanton1992 @TingTong_AD love you Mike.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-18 21:36:58	Just switched over to Les Mis on Sky Movies. Forgot how god awful Russell Crowe is at singing. Ruins the best character in the musical!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-20 15:11:09	@JoeCarlin1 apparently so. Not watching. Trying to keep track on the train! Seems defence and mainly Sackey is shit so far too. #COYQ
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-20 16:10:15	Proud of that effort by @QuinsRugbyUnion  Not many teams get bonus points away at Clermont. #buildonthat #COYQ
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-20 19:16:20	I think @David_Cameron should take one for the team and start doing up his top button, tieless of course, so everyone else stops
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-20 19:17:02	Also just realised that Robin Thicke looks really like Simon Cowell, is this some sort of plot!?
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-20 19:30:10	If they're going to lip sync why don't they keep the money and get a randomer to do it!? When she's singing she's out of tune! #KatiePerry
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-20 19:33:05	@TingTong_AD I wouldn't watch X factor if they're was a choice and I feel sitting in my room would be sad! I quite enjoy complaining too...
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-20 19:40:03	@TingTong_AD haha. Did you not know!?? I love to hate, it's fun. #ThatsalrightbecauseIlikethewayithurts
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-23 14:41:02	4th XV 13   Flair XV 13. Oops. That wasn't meant to happen. And we hit the post with a pen in the last play! @ExeterUniRFC
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-26 15:28:11	Wow @Saracens have got so little without their internationals! @SaintsRugby destroying them up front.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-25 19:40:31	@Les_Garcons32 spotted @NandosUK wondering whether they have enough chicken for Dowding #pileontheprotein
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-29 10:01:58	Wow JO'C now at Irish! Unbelievable
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-30 15:44:02	Flair 19 Bmouth 1s 20. Flair back from 20-5 to within 1 point Last kick a pen for the win controversially adjudged wide @ExeterUniRFC #drama
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-30 17:14:46	@Cotsyyy if you could email that to eurfcnews@gmail.com that would be ideal! Cheeeeers
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-10-31 11:42:36	What has Wade got to do to get in the starting XV?! Not even on the bench. I feel if he was 2 inches taller he'd be almost 1st on the sheet!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-11-02 14:30:19	COME ON ENGLAND
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-11-06 14:16:22	Tickets now on sale for 'The Hop' on November 17 at the Lemmy! Cast of @FootlightsUoE 's West Side Story performing! http://t.co/AFrYVhNWGG
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-11-11 21:27:38	@tim_clews Seeing as you're so impressed I expect you to join the cause. Juxtaposition between  thigh width and shin activism is poignant...
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-11-09 19:32:14	Wales beaten SA once since 1906, beaten NZ only in 1953, 1935 and 1905. World beaters? ..Chokers..
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-11-09 20:14:07	@JoeCarlin1 the rod is out there, some serious circling fish...
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-11-09 22:30:32	@TingTong_AD @JoeCarlin1 @GeorgeShirlaw he could at least spell Alain's surname correctly!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-11-13 16:13:38	Flair XV WIN!!! Held on for a 12-15 away win to UWE 2s. Hoppy and Baker with the tries! #howgoodwoulditfeel @ExeterUniRFC
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-11-15 21:58:06	I've just made myself bleed by eating a massive chunk of my own lip. What the hell. Ridiculous. Why do bad things happen to good people?!

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-11-23 23:51:24	First mistake of the night. Obviously I know that Gooch is the batting coach not Gatting! Decent start though on @XpressionFM tune in!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-11-20 15:52:10	Flair XV with another draw. 19-19 against second placed Bristol 3s. No late drama this time.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-11-23 20:05:39	Just seen Mick McCarthy's beard... What. Is. That.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-11-23 20:06:50	@EmmaMKelleher nah it's just commentary on the ashes until we get tired. Should be fun!

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-11-24 15:54:38	1/2 If he'd got the first one there would have been no argument. Either Owens stops the kick or Cruden does.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-11-24 15:55:22	2/2  Once he's taken it can't have another just because he missed!!! Ridiculous. Having said that NZ are just unreal when they turn it on
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-11-24 16:06:43	Rugby has been so good this Autumn. If it's like this in 2015 RWC how good's that going to be!?

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-08 21:08:01	@Simosloth it's not real. It's happening when we're asleep. It's not real. It's happening when we're asleep. It's not real ...
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-10 11:55:49	Missed yesterday's Advent Calendar from @XTVonline ? Then don't worry it's here! http://t.co/9JrpGfjinJ Curling in the forum is great fun!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-14 23:01:46	Rene Muelensteen has such a strange hybrid accent. A la Hamman/Molby Love it when that happens. Spotting the adopted phrases is a fun game!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-14 23:04:07	Also how boring is Henry? You can tell the MOTD chiefs want Henry to get on with it! Lots of Lineker interruptions
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-15 17:37:07	@owenkeats the juxtaposition between the ugliness of his face and the beauty of that goal is mindblowing
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-15 19:03:28	Tutors caught at @QuinsRugbyUnion v @RacingMetro92 today. @MC_2xP deploying the 'cold face' @CharlieBevan58 http://t.co/5qOr8DU6oJ

633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-18 21:43:13	@JonJenner league cup do init
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-18 21:46:52	@JonJenner Bradford were in the last final... go on, win it.. Do a Wigan. You mob and Sunderland are in the semis!! #coolcompetition
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-18 21:50:08	The fact that @MC_2xP made it to England, round the country and back to SA in less than two weeks is a minor miracle. Congrats #mcppuktour
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-19 14:16:39	The Tampa Bay Bucaneers fan page have favourited an @ExeposeSport tweet about #BUCS results. Yeah. Wrong end of the stick...
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-19 17:00:49	Sonny Bill just loves World Cups. Switch to RU for 2011 back to RL for 2013 now back to RU for 2015!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-21 13:30:30	I don't know what to say. Suarez.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-21 14:22:46	Do you reckon, if Cardiff score next, we'll be in for a grandstand finish Owen? You should tell us more about that...
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-21 15:08:33	Flood leaving end of the season. Scuppered his RWC chances. Probs good for him and England though. Who to back up Farrell now? Burns? Ford?
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-21 15:32:32	@ugomonye 9-3 Bath so far
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-21 16:13:40	I think we need to revisit this 'hands backwards' passing law. Lots of pretty clearly forward passes leading to tries being given.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-21 17:12:53	This is getting very embarrassing for Leicester. Not many would have predicted Exeter and Bath ahead of them at Xmas in Sept #longseason
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-20 15:09:22	â@followthethings: seems like this Friday is #ethicalcrackerfriday too. Please pass this on! http://t.co/o2kC1S9sUTâ @TomVK24 it continues!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-20 15:44:56	Well at least if he bails now Suarez is worth about Â£65 million plus!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-23 13:27:57	@ExeposeSport don't think they're amazing now or were awful before either!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-21 17:43:25	@MikeStanton1992 @Saracens I did actually fall asleep in the second half. Unrelated to the performance. Embarrassment for Leicester
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-21 17:46:19	@MikeStanton1992 @Saracens can't even take a compliment!! Don't expect them to capitulate like that regardless of how good sarries were
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-21 17:48:14	@MikeStanton1992 @Saracens I've never said Saracens were bad. Just don't like the club
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-21 17:53:00	@MikeStanton1992 @Saracens I keep saying Liverpool and Quins can't coordinate!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-25 23:48:41	I think the thing I hate most about Mitchell Johnson is his right arm. Just terrible. #MerryChristmas
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-26 00:36:32	@CricketAus 'few chances'!?? Er one...
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-26 00:45:34	Yeah...well... Who wants a sunny Christmas anyway...yeah... Take that Australia... Oh Cook's out. Bollocks.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-22 15:41:21	Come on SA stop it. Just try and win you aren't getting out. Twat it!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-22 15:49:22	Oh bloody hell SA! What have you done!? Bottled it.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-28 12:07:13	The Mighty jacket primed for #BigGame6  today. Quins v Chiefs. #tomahawkchoppers http://t.co/HrzCFsfkXo
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-28 17:17:00	@LouisAlexDore course I am!!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-28 18:24:57	@LouisAlexDore should have got the BP. Exeter were poor. We needed to be a bit more clinical. Win's a win though!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-29 17:54:58	Mourinho's @chelseafc are a disgusting, horrible club.
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-29 17:58:12	@owenkeats I refer you to my latest tweet. Mourinho breeds unfathomably nasty players. That Oscar challenge; Red. Eto'o 2nd min; Red
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-29 17:58:58	@owenkeats the worst!
633078692	willgkelleher	2013-12-29 18:01:49	Only dominating on Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 will get me out of this bad mood. #hitthosegreensinregulation
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-01-03 09:23:11	Yup that's the be way 09.23 outside the house. All hail the new storm. St Jude was nothing. #punverymuchintended http://t.co/11decDVMpq
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-01-04 00:07:16	17 for 4 sounds fun
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-01-04 00:17:18	Remember 1st Test Lord's 2005? We were 21-5 then! We only went and won the series! #ridiculouslyneedlessoptimism #timetocryyourselftosleep
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-01-04 00:25:52	When I went to the SCG Test 3 years ago I saw Cook get 189.... yeah that's right I'm gloating. But bloody hell!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-01-04 00:29:07	So yeah 23-5. I pretty much hope we get all out twice just so we don't ever have to watch this series again
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-01-04 00:35:05	@owenkeats oooo look at you with your turn of phrase. I'm crying here Owen!

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-05 19:04:51	@LouisAlexDore you know #exetervote is trending in the UK. Give that a mention lad, good effort
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-05 19:11:03	@LouisAlexDore even though I don't give a shit it's fun reading the feed of these debates. So much social media sassing going on

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-05 15:26:00	Finally a new post 'All up in the air' up on http://t.co/uKo25vlvqW it's a bit cheeky, sorry. @followthethings @ExeterGeography
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 18:18:16	In a shocking turn of events I'm actually present @ the AU debate. Only one that actually matters. Cue bitchiness from @LouisAlexDore and I
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 18:29:38	.@LouisAlexDore and I on the look out for the first candidate not to E.G. their water. Surely will lose hundreds of votes when it happens...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 18:38:08	These people are all the same I swear. Yawn. Anyone going to go rogue? #exetervote
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 18:40:20	Oooo lad culture question. Watch them squirm... And go against all that they've done for the last 2 years #exetervote
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 18:40:59	@RickyJFreelove I've got to talk about this on the radio later. Fucking hell
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 18:42:16	Higham is going to have fun going to all these socials as AU pres. Not so welcome if he's going to 'tone down' the culture in some places
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 18:44:45	Lad culture question. Pimms jug on the table. So exetahhh #exetervote
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 18:52:05	@BGMPullan @LouisAlexDore and women's. Both the netball girls I'm sure are absolute custodians of the ledge in TP
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 18:53:09	Shit. Watch them all jump on the touch rugby idea... Indigo lucky she went first on that one
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 19:04:30	@BGMPullan @LouisAlexDore but definitely wants to tone down drinking culture...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 19:12:02	Ok Higham has definitely won this. Actually seems to have a personality albeit no real concrete ideas like the rest #exetervote
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 19:19:04	@LouisAlexDore would be such a troll campaign
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 19:33:53	@EmmaMKelleher AU matters! Being slightly hypocritical too...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 19:38:34	@EmmaMKelleher they were so boring though!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 20:56:05	Wow what a terrible AU debate. No passion, agreed with each other throughout and so ill-prepared. Tiptoed pathetically [1/2]
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-02-06 20:56:45	[2/2] ...around drinking question. No one stood out even when given the chance. Just listed their CV. Yawn yawn yawn #exetervote

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-03-15 15:25:56	That was ridiculous from Wales. Potench offside though...?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-03-15 15:29:35	Ok @JiffyRugby you don't need to tell us there's an overlap every time with such excitement. Stop being a fan and start commentating!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-03-15 15:32:45	Wales win could be bigger than England's @ this rate Some seriously good attacking twinned w/terrible Scottish D. Too little too late though

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-16 21:31:51	@MikeStanton1992 love pens. He knows. That time of year. Only had my one fix though!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-16 22:05:20	@MikeStanton1992 lot more where that came from. World's gone mad. #pointless http://t.co/1SrKhg38SC

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-18 12:08:28	Ticket sold. @RugbyTigers was quickest off the mark. Thanks for the RT @RugbyQuins @NevsLeftBoot #COYQ tonight #rugbyunited
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-18 08:20:39	Not many clubs can sell out on a Friday night. Huge game for @QuinsRugbyUnion  #COYQ let's do it #quinsstyle
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-18 11:38:35	@RugbyTigers Yes it is- you were the first to reply. DM me and we can arrange where to meet at the Stoop
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-18 20:57:25	BIG and thoroughly deserved win for @QuinsRugbyUnion 2 more cup finals to go! Atmos absolutely brilliant tonight #COYQ
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-18 22:56:42	@nick10evans brilliant stuff, I'm hoarse. How's the leg NEV?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-19 16:42:58	Boooo. That's the end of that game. Bloody Sunderland
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-19 18:09:20	OH. MY. GOD. FABIO BLOODY BORINI
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-19 18:25:34	You just can't write it... and other clichÃ©s. PLEASE just win tomorrow Liverpool. B E L I E V E
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-20 10:03:48	Just seen Mourinho's MOTD interview. What a horrible person he is. Unfortunately, as usual his attitude permeates to the team, staff + fans
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-20 10:04:02	He suits that club and the club suit him. No class.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-20 10:09:09	@FranoAnnandale haha. You clearly haven't known me long. Been 'piping up' since 2004. My hatred for your club knows no boundaries.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-20 10:10:51	@FranoAnnandale his obvious sarcasm is embarrassing. Refs fault you lost to villa, palace, Newcastle and now Sunderland??
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-20 10:11:29	@FranoAnnandale and anyway it's an absolutely certain pen so... Shame
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-20 10:13:09	@FranoAnnandale but ultimately got the big decision right. Problem with him is players take no responsibility, all about him
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-20 10:15:38	@FranoAnnandale well I'll leave you thinking that. Complete bollocks but Mourinho has enraptured you too it seems! Under the spell
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-20 10:17:24	@FranoAnnandale oh right because Suarez is completely relevant to this!! Haha. Have a good Easter.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-20 10:21:25	@FranoAnnandale bloody hell, if we do... Nothing won yet
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-20 12:59:29	7 points for the title
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-21 13:43:45	If the Moyes rumours are true the phantom "United Way" has taken a bit of a battering...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-22 18:26:07	At @QuinsRugbyUnion for a Q&amp;A with the management. Interesting to see the vision for the club in the future. Other clichÃ©s are available...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-25 20:56:33	Northampton have just written the textbook on how to win ugly there. Very dull game but "effectiveness" prevails. Long way home after that!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-25 22:16:48	@TingTong_AD that is so much though you must agree! Sandy Park also overpriced- payed Â£30 to stand for an LV Cup game watching 2 youth XVs!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-25 22:25:22	@TingTong_AD completely disagree. V.expensive for an average ground. Great atmos defs but can't buy gstand ticks +view crap from tent stand
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-25 22:29:00	@TingTong_AD yeah they're extending. To be fair they've only been up 3/4 years. I'm just glad I get in free to 99% of games!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-25 22:44:05	@Cotsyyy @TingTong_AD inside knowl from Cotsyy. Good stuff. Defs needs a spruce up to match fan-base/ quality of support
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-26 15:39:45	The potential for my worst nightmares of a weekend looking all the more real after that Saracens half. Still got bloody Lpool to get through
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-26 15:51:40	@tim_clews @SportsYapper how is the game then?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-25 14:46:21	Off to Northampton to support the boys tonight. Hoping it's not too wet for running rugby! #lettheboysplay #QuinsStyle #COYQ
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-25 21:03:57	Quins were average tonight but as a fan I'd prefer, +I know the club prefer, to die trying. Most attacking positions kicked away by Saints!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-25 21:20:05	RTâ@NevsLeftBoot: The worst thing about tonight is that Northampton charge too much money for their tickets!â Â£50 to sit in the corner!!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-25 22:20:22	@stephenjones9 were you at the game? V.dull from the stands, plenty of mistakes + aimless kicking. One very good try brightened it a little
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-23 18:51:19	Of course. Back on Saturdays Term 3! Can't wait RTâ@BrekkieWaffles: RT if you are a Waffler! #breakfastwafflesâ
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-23 19:11:36	Breakfast Waffles back in 10 days! Saturday's 10-11. Madness resumes 3 May. Plenty to discuss! Can't wait? Get on http://t.co/UplAaU5Is5
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-27 15:17:31	Sport. It's the hope that kills you. Long way to go.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-28 13:39:55	@BrekkieWaffles beard looking strong..
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-29 14:20:42	My first @FootlightsUoE 'Into the Woods' rehearsal is tomorrow! Will be a great show- make sure you get your tickets! http://t.co/wKu3gsa3Hs
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-01 12:04:14	Hoping to be back on the airwaves on Sat @BrekkieWaffles with @MikeStanton1992 plenty to discuss! If you can't wait http://t.co/UplAaU5Is5
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-04-30 20:22:23	Mourinho: "the tactical genius"
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-04 12:01:31	Going to be hard to stay neutral on the @XpressionFM comms this afternoon with @QuinsRugbyUnion needing 5 points. Big game! (#COYQ)
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-03 17:38:38	And City are Champions. Bollocks. Thrown away
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-03 17:59:12	@JonJenner what else we up for? Come on the lads and ladettes!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-03 18:59:35	@JonJenner @Exepose how many awards left Jon?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-03 19:04:27	@JonJenner who won?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-05 22:10:25	1/2 Almost glad I've never lived a proper Liverpool title race before. Almost. Your heart isn't ripped out finishing 7th.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-05 22:12:41	2/2 May never get such an opportunity. Utter despair from wondrous elation 9 days ago. I guess that's why we keep coming back. Sport eh?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-05 22:17:08	What a superb season it's been though. 4th would've been amazing in Sep. The fact that I'm devastated we won't be Champions is unbelievable.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-05 22:19:32	What a hero Rogers is. Huge summer ahead. Plug the gaps in the defence and BUILD. So proud I support two GREAT clubs @LFC &amp; @QuinsRugbyUnion
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-05 22:24:21	@OllieWheatley haha true. Let's be honest we're fucking distraught. But #YNWA to the end. Some perfect lyrics in that for this situation
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-05 14:51:24	@JonJenner just doing my job Jon! I can see big things for ExeposÃ© XI. Xpression who?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-05 14:54:28	@owenkeats also it basically says if you use the very useful Google Maps you'll never have children. Take that society.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-03 16:41:08	@JonJenner is that the thing we put sport up for? If so COME ON BOYS!!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-03 17:47:23	@meg_drewett when are the results? We up for sport?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-03 17:57:06	@JonJenner bloody 'ell!! What time are the results. Surely we've got no chance?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-03 18:32:40	If we just beat Palace like 8 nil on Monday though...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-05 17:23:27	Accidentally ordered a single banana from Sainsbury's online. Bollocks. http://t.co/tEQPYeGlaV
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-04 15:00:47	Great game @SandyParkExeter and WHAT a win for @QuinsRugbyUnion  The fight for 4th still on! Comms to follow soon. http://t.co/cOWjY5ktOX
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-05 20:28:19	Not sure who to blame for missing most of this half. @SkyHelpTeam for shit Sky Go, @virginmedia for shit internet or anyone else! #Buffering
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-05 20:40:41	Fucks sake. You just can't concede close to 50 goals in a season and expect win anything. Brilliant season but  so much improvement needed
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-06 10:55:31	Another rehearsal for @FootlightsUoE Into the Woods tonight. Book your tickets here. It'll be a fantastic show! http://t.co/UX41oYOXCn
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-08 07:48:31	The Dutch accent is great. Only a Dutchman could get away with calling it the 'World Championship Cup League' as van Gaal did in interview
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-08 09:26:27	Blimey! Back on the 'waves in 3 days!! @BrekkieWaffles returns with a happy vengeance this Sunday 10-11! You just wouldn't want to miss it!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-13 13:36:20	Awkward for Walker, Cole and Carrick who are in the book for England...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-13 18:07:45	@AngusNeate unfortunately 9 packs and no swaps. We'll have to wait...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-11 21:32:21	@JonJenner why? What's the point in taking him. Not played all year. We're obvs not gonna win it so why not blood Shaw?? Lamps pick a joke
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-10 20:18:38	@AngusNeate apparently it's a rogue shout...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-10 20:53:20	@RickyJFreelove and just copying the Police's every breath you take chord progression...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-11 21:59:35	@LouisAlexDore @owenkeats @JonJenner Told you after week 2 wildcard &amp; today it's confirmed ExeposÃ© fantasy Champ 2014 #proud #trophycabinet

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-10 22:11:30	@AngusNeate he's so old!! Haha
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-10 22:16:29	Are Ireland as well!?? Has anyone noticed it's got a beard?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-10 22:19:39	So you're saying if I went on Eurovision with a dress on I'd win..? #revisionbeard

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-13 14:50:23	"So Roy you're telling me I'm not in the squad and Frank is?" said Michael Carrick's face. Poor Michael Carrick... http://t.co/dNKOcfdUBE
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-13 19:37:05	@ExeposeArts I think you've spoken to Katie Turner? She'll be the one to talk to I'm just in the cast!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-13 19:37:52	@AngusNeate need to get myself back to Morrisons! Any other nearby shops?!?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-13 19:42:00	@AngusNeate classic. I can imagine some dodgy deals being done over the Internet!

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-24 21:08:48	Let's be honest. Everyone knows that Bale has just ruined pen Christmas.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-24 21:18:42	This is so shit for Bale now! Would have looked so much better at 2-1 for him! Not sure he'll care though...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-24 21:24:45	Imagine if rugby managers did this Simeone/Mourinho pathetic carry-on crap...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-05-24 21:29:24	@EmmaMKelleher sarries ran out. Wolf pack exposed by some QUALITY from Toulon. Switched it on when needed. Thoroughly deserved!

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-10 14:40:43	@StJamesRdWC this is what Mr Twitter had in mind when he legged it down to the patent office. Superb
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-12 15:07:02	I feel a season of utter misery ahead. Would be embarrasing if Chelsea, with Costa and Fabregas, didn't win the league now. Shit. Shit on it
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-12 10:02:42	The tones of Soul Limbo at 10.25 this morn @bbctms have made my day! The 1st Test of the Summer is upon us. Time to #digin Cook and Robson.

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-12 20:58:17	I don't think ITV player is sorry
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-12 21:03:38	My Dad has just described Adrian Chiles as a "wad cheese". Probably apt.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-12 21:09:10	Having to watch this in French. Cheers @ITV  you literally can't do anything without being shit.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-12 21:16:36	Surely the managers don't HAVE to wear their accreditation in the dugout?! #EveryWorldCup
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-12 21:51:20	Told ya so. 3-1. Visionary.

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-23 18:32:43	@gailfdavies @ExeterGeography thanks very much Gail! And for our chat back in February about all this!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-24 12:45:17	@EmmaMKelleher that is ridiculous!!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-24 18:29:32	This Suarez biting allegation is seriously bad news for Liverpool. British media will be the ones kicking up most of a fuss and he'll be off
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-28 18:56:59	NOOOO. THE POST!!! 

Ladies and Gentlemen. That is pens. Love. It. 

Hands together for Colombia on pens!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-28 19:00:59	If you don't like Sport. You're shit. It's official. Go away. No one likes you.

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-28 19:45:40	Is Ian Wright's hat trending yet? #shhat
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-28 20:11:08	@tom_bond or the inbetweeners movie in 25 years time. O'Neill as Will and one of the actors dropped out so Chiles was a last min call
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-28 16:33:25	So many dirty challenges in this. Odds on it ending 11 v 11?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-28 16:49:59	Can I ask for 3-3 and then #prayforpens ??
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-28 17:20:38	Such a marginal call
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-28 17:54:23	Ok now we go #PRAYFORPENS
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-30 05:24:44	Can believe I missed Costa Rica pens last night! In the queue for Wimbledon. Hence the early tweet. Gunning for the hill early doors.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-28 18:29:03	Ok ultimate call. Neymar misses pen to put Brazil out. Country would riot surely!? I would genuinely be scared for everyone's safety...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-28 18:30:01	Chile literally can't do this. So dangerous if they win! Think of the nationwide carnage
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-28 18:50:23	What are they mad!?? Subs always miss pens!!!! I am loving this
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-28 18:54:08	Neymar miss anyone...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-30 09:50:25	@sass_michael camped last night from 6 pm. Got ground tickets and in relatively quickly. In ground by 9.30 &amp; court 3 seats by 10.45
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-01 18:24:29	Don't. Curse. It.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-01 18:27:26	Bollocks
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-01 18:30:07	Yes Benaglio
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-01 18:32:03	Extra 30 secs surely?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-01 18:32:55	My word. Under the wall go on...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-01 18:35:41	Should've gone under the wall... #asif
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-01 18:42:26	Why does @GaryLineker sometimes sit on the left of the pundits and sometimes the right? Or am I making that up? #rotatingdesk
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-01 20:50:16	Told you! @GaryLineker is on the right now!! So odd.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-30 08:15:45	Nearly there! #thequeue #Wimbledon2014 http://t.co/w1SxSI9WBN
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-30 21:24:08	Germans to win this now or wait til the last min then?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-30 21:25:46	@murrays_mind worked for me in the Brazil match! Was praying from Luiz' knee-in off Jara. #12yarders
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-30 09:48:54	Court 3 with fellow @FootlightsUoE member @coxy5394 . Lopez v Isner awaits. #Wimbledon2014 http://t.co/kcCTVfzwBh
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-30 10:00:34	@sass_michael yeah pretty big. We were 1200 odd back evening before and only wanted ground. Could have had court 1 tho if we had cash!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-06-30 22:31:26	Ooh Algeria. Timing is everything eh?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-04 19:51:57	Come on James and Neymar. 2-2 and pens if you don't mind. Keen for the long haul boys.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-04 21:29:54	WHAT a goal. Really coming to hate Brazil though. Feeling for my boy James.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-04 21:37:20	Bollocks. That's a red!!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-04 17:03:16	Why are these World Cup half times longer? Usually 15 mins isn't it?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-04 21:56:18	Does anyone who isn't Brazilian actually like Brazil right now? So unlikeable!!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-07 11:34:00	@edwardjohnson05 that whole bit is slightly creepy. "Oo I'll just take your pail of water if you show me your house" "yep, I'm saving you"
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-07 11:43:31	@edwardjohnson05 "tell me my child what is your name?" "My names Fuck Off!"
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-07 11:48:51	@edwardjohnson05 who knew Les Mis was so hilarious right!?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-07 12:13:07	@edwardjohnson05 gags a minute at the Queen's
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-08 19:48:56	Not sure I like myself for this but I wouldn't begrudge a #GER win here. Really dislike #BRA atm. Although Bra v Arg final... Ok #pray4pens
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-08 19:56:40	Oh come on Neymar hasn't died FFS
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-08 19:57:46	@FRSGillies literally just tweeted the same thing!! Such a joke. How funny would a 3-0 Germany demolition look...?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-08 20:24:04	This is perfect. Either it ends 5-0 or 3-3. Quality. Less mourning, less cheating and more defending needed Brazil!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-08 20:25:44	I'm sorry Brazil but you completely deserve this
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-08 20:26:02	@FRSGillies Jesus this is ridiculous
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-08 20:28:32	@MikeStanton1992 as I've said this can't go better! Could be a record or 4-4!! Loving it. We can have pens tomorrow!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-08 20:29:35	Ok now this is getting dangerous for everyone's safety in Brazil
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-08 20:30:42	@MikeStanton1992 backing 8-1
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-08 20:38:12	Things you thought you'd never say No.37 "Wow. Look at those 9 Brazilians defending the edge of their box hoping not to go 6-0 down"
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-08 20:44:21	@AngusNeate @MikeStanton1992 if only Ray Winstone was on at half time *Neuer next goal 10-1 "have a bang on that". I think I would!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-08 20:59:32	Reports of fighting in the streets and burning flags at Half Time. National Humiliation only just started it seems.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-09 20:53:14	Pens written all over this one at the mo. Excellent. #pray4pens #inforthelonghaul
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-09 21:00:46	@AngusNeate @MikeStanton1992 unrelated note... planet of the apes looks shit. Who wants to see monkeys with guns!? Don't get it! #shads
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-09 21:05:32	"What'll be the decisive factor Fabio?" "Well whoever scores more goals than the other should have the best chance" #shouldvesaid #punditry
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-09 21:07:08	More Punditry: No Semi Final has ever ended level after pens. #fact #pens4evz #pray4pens
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-09 21:57:06	Right boys. You know the drill. Keep it dull for 30 mins then it all kicks off. #pray4pens #drama
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-09 22:06:36	@murrays_mind I think you're forgetting van Gaal is a "tactical genius" Murray... Clissen obvs going to score the 5th peno
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-09 22:15:52	If someone ruins this I'll be bloody livid #pray4pens
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-09 22:28:17	How is no one other than @murrays_mind &amp; his merry pen pals on the #pray4pens hype? V few on a search! Madness. #besthashtagoutthere
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-09 22:29:36	@murrays_mind solid point. Surely will go global at some point. Especially if Final Pens features #pray4pens
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-09 22:33:48	#pray4pens the gift that keeps on giving is back, back, back
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-09 22:35:06	@murrays_mind might have a baby if Cillessen or Romero step up from 12 yards... #pray4pens
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-09 22:36:24	@moore_of_wj muted but bubbling up inside. Cillessen to net the winner... #keeperpens
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-09 22:39:46	@moore_of_wj If Cillessen takes one and scores I'll buy you drinks all Tuesday night. #claim
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-09 22:51:16	For the 3rd time ever it's a (West) Germany v Argentina final. 1986, 1990 and 2014. 3-2 #ARG '86; 1-0 #GER '90; Predict 2-1 #Germany '14
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-09 22:56:51	Is anyone genuinely going to watch the final on ITV??
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-13 21:04:54	I'm being extra demanding tonight. Not only are the hands clasped for #pray4pens Final style, but also Neuer to step up and sudden death...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-13 21:25:42	Fuck you Mario. 7 MINS FOR PEN GLORY ARGENTINA #pray4pens
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-07-13 21:35:11	But....but... Pens...

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-08-07 11:12:12	Is there anything better than Batsmen at sea against sublime Anderson swing? If so I'd like to see it.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-08-07 14:35:50	Can't help but feel responsible for Dhoni's innings (see a few tweets back). Sorry England. My fault. #TweetersCurse
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-08-07 14:37:34	Having said that if we get 2 more like that then it won't matter!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-08-10 11:43:19	Only 26 mins in and only a friendly but @LFC looking very confident against @BVB . Coutinho and Lovren looking quality. Good signs
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-08-10 13:38:38	Bit weird that McDonalds are calling the child mascots "escorts" for the game today...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-08-08 16:30:52	Off to the Stoop for the first time in a while. Hoping @QuinsRugbyUnion can dazzle the rest at the @premrugby_7s Finals. #Quins

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-09-27 17:02:48	RT @premrugby "#rugby @Saracens 40 @SaleSharksRugby 19  http://t.co/m0cWpuGjiV" report written by me! Dominant win for Sarries.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-09-27 20:28:34	Some distinctly dodgy sentiments from Nigel Wray, @Saracens owner in the programme today. Wants to keep rich, rich &amp; poor, poor essentially
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-09-27 20:32:15	He's an advocate of a higher salary cap for top clubs and a lower version for the dross. As if they're not advantaged enough, ridiculous.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-09-27 12:09:49	At Allianz Park today for @Sportsbeat . @Saracens v @SaleSharksRugby on the menu. Good conditions for running rugby! http://t.co/rBX6IvyW5l
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-09-28 09:26:10	New article up on the blog: Saracens 40 Sale 19 from the Aviva Premiership website, http://t.co/8xWaXf9A9r
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-09-28 10:32:14	Can we stop banding about HQ as an interim home please? I don't want Chelsea/Spurs fans here! They couldn't fill it! http://t.co/PR6Y48GQ0E
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-09-28 13:53:31	Wow. I think @QuinsRugbyUnion have got worse! So many basic errors and yet another centre injured to add to the list. Sort it out boys!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-09-28 14:48:51	@QuinsRugbyUnion A comedy of errors. One thing to be pumped by Saracens, but Exeter? Awful, awful performance. Outplayed all round again.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-09-29 15:38:51	RT @BrekkieWaffles: Ep 2 is listed 19th in the @mixcloud comedy charts!! Only been up 1 day! http://t.co/PZQLDX807y http://t.co/SL2Wz4JmSj
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-09-30 07:59:10	@jimw1 surely a more pertinent argument is pitch damage Ã  la Murrayfield. Just because Chelsea fans are richer doesn't mean they're welcome!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-09-30 08:05:07	@jimw1 fair Jim. I'm a sport lover and live behind the cabbage patch and would hate to think Chelsea's games would take priority over Quins
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-09-30 08:09:56	@jimw1 it's not the individuals I'm worried about but the stark change in atmosphere that could descend on my home on a Sat afternoon/eve

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-10-04 17:06:27	Big half century @QuinsRugbyUnion . @LondonWelshRFC frankly embarrassing- proof that Champ playoffs a bad idea! What are Bristol thinking!?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-10-04 17:08:39	To paraphrase The Whealdstone Ranger, they've got no fans, they've got no ground and it doesn't look like they want some!

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-10-25 09:34:32	@rugbymedia @England2015 should be a residents allocation! Lived round the corner from HQ for 22 years and 0 tickets out of 20 #unluckydip

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 14:43:08	So flair from @Barbarian_FC  . Love that penalty move!!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-10-30 17:04:22	Big win in @ShorthandWC . Loving how complacent the FT lot are. We'll get through on team spirit alone!! #ShorthandWorldCup
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-10-30 17:06:12	@Richo_Journo @NewsAssociates @ShorthandWC not sure about your definition of silence!#shotsfired
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 16:24:00	That's what rugby is about! Amazing quality and flair from @Barbarian_FC If only they'd grabbed the winner!! Aus must be knackered
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 20:09:41	Some tragic attempts by the commentators to explain rugby in this USA NZ game! #GOALSHOTALLAFRICANAMERICANS
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 20:23:56	Amazing backside flip from Israel Dagg... #americancommentary 

Surely a rugby @UScricketguy or @ussoccerguy esque account round the corner?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 20:26:47	Surely ABs look to raise the bat today? #tonup
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 20:32:32	Yes they're broadcasting to the lay person but not sure commentators know some of the rules! Good to see rugby spreading tho #rugbyunited
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 22:20:35	Boom. Love this from @DailyMailUK . Dr Ian @followthethings would be proud. Harman and Ed not looking so smug now... http://t.co/i6ZJ7U8Bfr
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 22:22:18	That front page makes me want to delve back into my dissertation... For another day... @followthethings ! #Shhh
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 22:27:35	1/2 Maybe people will think twice before mindlessly jumping on the bandwagon to look good in front of the public. Plenty more products
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 22:29:51	2/2 made in sweatshops that we take for granted. Needs ballsy editors &amp; journos to hold big companies to account @followthethings
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 22:35:18	@JonJenner @followthethings tell me about it but shhhh! All in good time with further investigations..
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 22:39:18	In other news, off to Saracens tomorrow. Strictly impartial...
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 22:48:59	@The_Badger14 is it responsibility of athletes to know what he's consuming? Maybe not- but glad it shows arcane dirty underbelly of industry
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 22:50:06	@The_Badger14 also serves them right for tragically jumping on a band wagon just to garner votes
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 22:54:14	@The_Badger14 hopefully people go beyond politics &amp; realise how little we know about where our stuff's made Plenty more where that came from
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 23:01:55	@The_Badger14 if it gets people talking and looking at their labels it doesn't matter how. Isn't that right @followthethings ?!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-01 23:21:45	@JonJenner @followthethings hopefully I'll get a job somewhere that will back me with it! Needs more work though... #sizzlingonthebackburner

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-10-31 18:37:49	@AngusNeate @MikeStanton1992 Armitage won't play for England now. Burgess will play centre to start with but will move to 6 later I reck
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-10-31 18:40:57	@MikeStanton1992 @AngusNeate 0% chance of Armitage coming back. Had to move before European ties or no one would take him. Decision made
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-10-31 18:43:05	@MikeStanton1992 @AngusNeate if he wanted to play for Eng he'd take a pay cut. All about the Euros. Doesn't want it enough. Don't need him!

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-09 15:01:43	Massive drama ready to unfold @ShorthandWC results tomorrow. Not sure I've managed to squeeze through but anything can happen in the Cup!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-10 09:59:14	Gutted to be out the @NewsAssociates @ShorthandWC - wasn't close really! It was a whirl while it lasted. Taking solace in News Test results!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-10 10:55:51	@alextrickett Cheers!
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-11 19:11:38	Real shame for Rokoduguni to miss Sat's @bokrugby match. @EnglandRugby need consistency in selection and injuries not helping! Wider issue?

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-21 22:56:11	Gone backwards every year since we stunned people in 2012. Poor 11 to 14. Poor signings. No tempo. No umph. But got to back the boys #COYQ
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-21 23:08:06	Bath (A) and Leinster x2 to follow. The pessimist in me can only see three more losses from those if nothing changes. Hi ho silver lining...

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-26 22:20:21	Best moment of the @bbcapprentice so far surely "that would be if I wanted one...what about SEVEN" #hottubs #SEVEN
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-27 07:41:11	Unbelievably awful news about Phil Hughes. He was only playing cricket for God's sake. Horrible for the family and Abbot. Just terrible.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-27 07:48:43	Implications for helmet manufacturers, short pitched bowling and cricket generally may be huge. Freak accident but will things now change?
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-28 21:04:01	What a bad signing Tikoirotuma was. Professional rugby player who can't catch, make yards or tackle. Who scouted him!? #Quins
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-28 21:28:26	This is horrible to watch. For a club with top four aspirations like @QuinsRugbyUnion absolutely embarrassing and fully deserved. Again.
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-11-28 22:00:13	Well my w/end can only get better. Small matter of the biggest job in my teeny tiny career yet tomorrow. Can't wait. #ENGvAUS #Twickenham

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-12-07 17:14:19	And all the @ChrisRobshaw "not a 7" chat looks more laughable every week. Absolute monster on his 200th app. #COYQ #Quins
633078692	willgkelleher	2014-12-07 18:27:03	@kealalex People do doubt his work at the breakdown though. Proved to be up w/the best last few weeks. England's probs are not in the pack!

633078692	willgkelleher	2014-12-22 23:22:07	BOD's wise words http://t.co/VBxEuB51Rn. Teach skill not size. Also feel game needs to quicken up - get ball in play longer so endurance key

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-08 19:40:27	@ExeEducation apart from #colin panic and cancelling the Football Varsity...
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-08 19:47:53	@ExeEducation fair. But chat of an indoor pool (again!) is a bit ridiculous

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-14 14:48:08	No way Brown can continue after that. Out cold and unmoved for 10 secs or so. Nasty. Backline reshuffle to come. #ENGvITA #6Nations
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-14 15:13:28	Can no one in Italy kick?? #6Nations
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-14 15:33:55	Good to hear @mikebrown_15 doesn't need to go to hospital. Looked horrible. Luckily for @EnglandRugby he's got a week off to recover #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-14 16:20:24	Very poor to concede three today. Some big defensive holes. Plenty to improve on. Ireland match on March 1 a monster now. #6Nations #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-14 18:04:24	Bastareaud has poor technique in defence and attack. Goes in way too high in both. Can't just rely on his size. #IREvFRA #6Nations #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-14 18:05:03	@MikeStanton1992 Bastareaud another one...

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-14 17:24:13	Eddie Butler's pronunciation of O'Mahony's name is so unnecessary... #IREvFRA #6Nations #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-15 14:56:40	And don't get me started on leeks. Who has a national vegetable anyway!? #punditry #rugby #6nations #SCOTvWAL
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-15 15:51:50	Seems that Conor's @QuinsRugbyUnion "purple patch" is still pending... #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-14 18:01:35	@MikeStanton1992 so affected and ridiculous. Fofana equally annoying
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-15 16:39:54	This is crazy. What are you doing Scotland!?? #SCOTvWAL
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-15 16:46:20	Wales' scrum has been awful today. Where's Adam Jones when you need him..? #rugby #SCOTvWAL
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-15 16:49:05	Jackson had an absolute Weston of a 2nd half there #6nations #SCOvWAL #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-15 16:56:59	@TingTong_AD thoroughly unconvincing and aided by poor reffing... Strong case for 3 yellows not given...But that's just my view ð£
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-15 16:57:53	@TingTong_AD having said that Scotland shot themselves in the foot. All well and good being "brave" but doesn't win you games
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-15 18:14:06	@murrays_mind it's dull. Just say they weren't good enough. Scotland could have won today but butchered it. Is that "brave"?
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-15 18:04:42	Never want any of my sides to be labelled "brave". Saved for boring clichÃ©d branding of all African football &amp; average rugby teams #punditry
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-15 16:38:53	Such muddled thinking from Scotland. Take the three and you've still got 10 mins!! #rugby #6Nations #SCOTvWAL
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-15 14:53:58	Whoever invented the daffodil headwear needs to have a serious word with themselves. #why #6Nations #SCOTvWAL #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-15 16:42:30	I'd love some clarification on the offside line at the breakdown @WorldRugby . Most sides now line up from the tunnel not back foot! #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-15 17:01:37	@TingTong_AD @JoeCarlin1 we aren't arguing are we? All agreed I thought..??
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-02-16 14:46:59	Messing about this arvo... My current @lionsofficial XV would have 6 English (5 of those forwards), 5 Welsh and 4 Irish. Thoughts? #rugby

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-06 21:33:57	Sale 1st side to stop @bathrugby scoring this season. Shows their progress but 4 points all the same - Bath 2nd. Tight at the top! ð#rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-06 21:39:29	@andNickMullins @RugbyEng @btsportrugby maybe have a new feature @rugbytonight taking 1 law of the game &amp; explaining via demo. Good for kids
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-07 14:49:28	Battle for 8th, 9th &amp; 10th @premrugby for me today. At the Stoop. Predicting @QuinsRugbyUnion to hit their straps after a sabbatical #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-07 16:50:59	A spluttering win @QuinsRugbyUnion but a win nonetheless. Build on it. Irish never looked likely but Quins will always give a chance! #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-07 17:17:28	Wow. Draw at Kingsholm! How good has @premrugby been this season?? 10 pts between 2nd &amp; 7th. Squeaky bum time... #rugby #rugbyunited
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-08 09:26:34	Great morning for rugby at Farnham RUFC for the @QuinsRugbyUnion leg of the Land Rover @premrugby cup ! @Sportsbeat http://t.co/ljcVPgHsH7
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-08 11:43:06	Farnham cheered on by @QuinsRugbyUnion stalwart @thegoatman5 at the Land Rover @premrugby tournament. @Sportsbeat http://t.co/R6zomzNlBC
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-11 22:33:42	@Bilal_Chohan not all sides win like that. If he comes out and is honest then 100% more respect but I doubt he will. Not his style
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-11 22:37:07	@Bilal_Chohan right ok. Video will solve everything. Blame authorities for Jose telling players to sprint to ref, cheap shots etc! Sure!
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-11 22:38:56	@Bilal_Chohan fair he has been far more gracious than usual
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-11 22:42:37	@Bilal_Chohan I would argue there's a difference between doing everything to win at pro level and being spiteful &amp; outwardly nasty
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-11 22:43:46	@Bilal_Chohan maybe. That's another can of worms! Still not sure where I stand on it! I'd say surrounding ref etc is worse than not walking
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-11 22:44:05	@Bilal_Chohan having said that so hard to compare
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-11 22:45:26	@Bilal_Chohan Costa shoving over not physical enough? Does there need to be a spirit of football? No spirit of rugby! Refs in charge there
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-11 22:50:45	@Bilal_Chohan I couldn't bring myself to cheer for Chelsea! Never get this English clubs thing. Wouldn't expect United to support City/Lpool
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-11 21:40:46	You know it. #pray4pens ðð

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-11 22:17:32	How Jose will explain it -campaign to get Zlatan off, keep Costa on, play lethargically &amp; throw it away? All part of the plan eh? #CHEPSG
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-11 22:20:51	So... English sport eh? #ChampionsLeague #CWC15 . Rugby lot to get us back on track..? #6nations
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-11 22:23:36	Get in there Souness. Tell it like it is Been going on for too long. Jose a galvanising factor - everywhere he goes it's the same #Chelsea
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-11 22:27:33	And this the iconic image of the night. All 10 outfield players closing in on an incompetent ref.. #MourinhosChelsea http://t.co/Pj94h6SFaQ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-11 22:29:35	@Bilal_Chohan bitter about what? It's true isn't it? Porto 04 Chelsea 05 era, Milan 10, Madrid 13 all carved in his confrontational image.

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-13 11:45:48	@rugbymedia yep I'm sure. We can have a play around too. We try and do on pitch &amp; outside issue each ep to break it up and cover big issues

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-28 16:53:28	Obligatory Mexican Wave @ Wembley. Problem of getting 85,000 bums on seats is around 30k don't care about result. Same w/Big Game #SarVQuins
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-28 17:03:24	And for all his finishing ability that's why @ChrisAshton1 won't/shouldn't play for England. #SARvHAR #SarVQuins #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-28 17:14:06	.@QuinsRugbyUnion gone. Start to plan for 2015/16. @Saracens 2nd and almost certain to be at Twickenham come May to repeat 2014 final IMO

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-29 06:37:55	This final looks over. Hope I'm wrong. Shame for #NZ . #Aus bowling attack formidable. #CWC15 #BacktheBlackCaps
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-29 06:42:53	Must bat the overs now. Keep yourselves in it for as long as possible. Looks gone though #CWC15 #BacktheBlackCaps
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-29 06:45:28	@jtoneysbeat quietest I've ever heard 80,000 on Boxing Day 2010. One of my great live sporting days. Aus 98 Eng 157-0 at close. Wonderful
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-29 07:48:56	How good would if feel...? #NZ #CWC15  #BacktheBlackCaps
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-29 10:09:39	Second World Cup in a row goes to the home side. 2019 tournament in England... Yeah right. #CWC15 #AUS #NZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-29 03:37:12	My word. What a start for Australia. Brendon gone! Still backing black #AUSvNZ #cwc15 #backingtheblackcaps
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-03-29 03:38:34	@Bilal_Chohan feel for him. He's the talisman and gone in a flash. Great ball though
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-02 18:57:04	Any odds on Farage doing a dramatic PR-stunt walk-out? Drama #leadersdebate
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-02 18:59:00	Actually I'd love to see a darts-esque walk-on for all 7. Although Plaid Cymru picking 'Bread of Heaven' would be nauseous... #leadersdebate

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-02 19:35:37	@Les_Garcons32 much appreciated #outofmydepth
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-02 19:37:52	@Les_Garcons32 no idea. Not sure there's much point in SNP, Cyrmu, Greens and UKIP being there!
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-02 19:48:00	Nothing unites Twitter better than taking the piss out of politicians. #leadersdebate
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-05 12:42:55	Pleased Owens bucking trend of an automatic card for attempted intercept. Deliberate should be deliberate. Most can catch 1 handed!! #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-04 10:52:26	Bid day of sport. Thoroughly looking forward to @LFC v @Arsenal before the small matter of mammoth @ChampionsCup quarters! #football #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-02 20:31:03	@Les_Garcons32 obviously they do. They agreed the four areas beforehand. Would never be a free-for-all. No one would agree to that before
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-02 20:37:11	@Les_Garcons32 would be great. No autocues, no notes, NO MERCY! 

But sadly unrealistic.
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-02 21:00:10	@TingTong_AD @Les_Garcons32 backing Farage and Sturgeon for sub-5ers
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-02 21:01:30	@TingTong_AD @Les_Garcons32 meanwhile Clegg is on the safety
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-02 21:06:59	So anyone changing their minds after  that messy, convoluted, media-trained "debate"? Thought not. #leadersdebate
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-05 13:49:34	Only a French side could throw that away. What were they thinking!? 20 seconds! #ChampionsCup #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-04 12:53:00	Odds on a @D_Sturridge second-half hattrick? Hmmm... #AFCvLFC
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-04 13:35:04	Thought it would be 4-1 at HT. Honest. Alright don't believe me... Embarrassing for @LFC . At least I'm neutral for the #rugby next!
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-04 13:37:58	Blackburn game looking all the more tricky after that. @LFC must win FA Cup now. 2 bad defeats in a row after v good 2015 #football
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-05 15:26:38	Poor from Armitage there. Greedy! Wonder what the chat would be if Robshaw, Haskell et al made that mistake? #TOUvWAS #ChampionsCup #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-05 15:33:10	What a take from Davies at the line out! Slip made the overlap but great draw from Daly. Game on or stayed execution? #ChampionsCup #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-05 15:50:37	"If Ali Williams doesn't get a yellow card it will be one of the grave injustices of our time". More wisdom from Barnes. Thanks mate. #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-05 15:52:02	IT'S A GRANDSTAND FINISH JEFF! Love European rugby! #ChampionsCup #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-05 15:52:44	Could we even #pray4pens in the Rugby!?? #dreamscometrue
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-05 15:55:52	Apologies. Premature on the #pray4pens hype. It was a stayed execution. Great work from Wasps but a dramatic defeat nonetheless #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-05 15:57:09	Barnes loves an ill-placed superlative doesn't he? #thankgodforbt #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-05 16:08:29	Some absolutely monstrous semis in #ChampionsCup. Cream rising to the top. New comp has been a great success. Who to back? Clermont? #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-05 16:12:38	@magnus310592 Toulon v Wasps. Chance of a draw cruelly snatched away by the French. The day for pens will have to wait #rugbypens #pray4pens
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-04 17:28:00	This is an absolute flair destruction! #ChampionsCup #clermont #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-04 18:02:02	Woahhh Bendy! Incredible!! #ChampionsCup #clermont
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-04 18:20:14	Thanks for the insight Barnes... Punching someone in the face "means he cares". Right. #Waller #ChampionsCup #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-05 16:13:31	@podcastrugby @MikeStanton1992 @chjones9 @rugbymedia @jhosie43 @trevorlarge Clermont my favs for now. Superb yesterday.
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-04 18:30:23	For all the #Bendy hype there's no way he'd get in ahead of Brown. England only pick 2 backs for the bench - can't have 'em all! #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-04 18:32:28	A Massif win for #clermont . See what I did there...? #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-03 11:05:33	What a game between @Hurricanesrugby &amp; @THESTORMERS . Canes march on for another week - biggest scare yet #RazzleDazzle #HURvSTO #SuperRugby

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-09 23:37:55	What a hero Richie was. Every sporting fan has their own impression &amp; favourite turn of phrase. That's his everlasting legacy #Benaud
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-10 20:27:03	Saracens could be out of the top four if results go against them this weekend. Who'd have thought it? Love the prem #rugby #rugbyunited
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-11 18:48:55	Good @QuinsRugbyUnion win but won't affect final standings. Scrum dominated. Clifford yellow suspect. @gloucesterrugby threw it away #rugby

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-14 18:56:34	Barry Edwards compares the EU to both a "cartel" and akin to the Eurovision Song Contest. Safe to say others disagree #election2015
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-14 19:35:46	At this Amnesty International event @tania_mathias very keen to state her involvement with the #UN #election2015
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-14 20:03:06	Audible support for @tania_mathias &amp; @GreenTanyaW over support for Palestine. Tanya says Israel "racist" state akin to apartheid SA #GE
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-14 20:16:51	Audible groan as @BarryTwickUKIP refers a q on renewable energy to building houses for Europeans. Then attacks voters for groaning! #GE2015

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-18 12:44:04	Come to think of it could be a #pray4pens coupon buster this weekend with #ARSvREA and #AVvLIV #FaCupSemiFinal as well! Bring me the pennos!
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-18 14:36:57	100% No arms from Ashton #CLEvSAR
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-18 14:40:06	So important that big decisions made in these huge games. #ChampionsCup #CLEvSAR
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-18 15:10:21	BOD is spot on. Ashton double offence to deny the try. First offside then a no-armer. Both unpunished and they lead. #ChampionsCup #CLEvSAR
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-18 16:11:12	&amp; with that I've booked my @ChampionsCup final ticket! As I said @podcastrugby backing @ASMOfficiel for their 1st title #ChampionsCup #rugby

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-17 21:14:33	Poor really from England not to seal the deal. Chat'll be about an earlier declaration but superb stuff from Holder to see 'em home #cricket

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-17 21:47:23	@TeddyCutler you can live broadcast video - people add comments etc. Vaughan uses it to show Geoffrey and Aggers podcast at stumps

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-26 14:59:36	Could be a big droppy for @ExeterChiefs . Still all to play for with 2 rounds left. Been a top season #rugby #WASPvEXE
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-25 10:07:50	@MikeStanton1992 for all the good it did the Rebels...
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-04-25 10:09:50	@MikeStanton1992 Rebels didn't clear lines. Tackled 5m out and then rolled for the try. Would get absolutely hammered for that here

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-02 14:38:26	Box office still trying to flog @ChampionsCup final tickets for Â£80 even though they know it won't sell out! Ridiculous! #Clermont #Toulon

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-02 19:03:48	As social experiments go this Toulon one is pretty special. Not sure I'd like it to last 4-in-row though! Deserved record-breakers #3times
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-02 19:10:00	For Clermont it's another year as the glorious defeated. No clue why Lopez went for risky kick with 10 secs on the clock.. #championscup

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-08 07:46:54	Ironic looking at #twickvote left-wing voters caused Vince's downfall. Vote for Labour/Green stole his majority &amp; gave you Tory #SWLGE2015

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-08 09:28:05	Looks like Zafar will bat 6 (May even float in new English line-up) and take ODI number #237 hopefully first of many caps. #IrevEng #cricket

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-09 10:04:55	First #rugby match for over a year with @saundy8 today. Could be interesting. Time to dust off some flair...
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-11 18:19:18	To put this in context #Pietersen has only scored runs this year against some students and a side who haven't won for 2 years #KP
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-11 18:20:51	@TeddyCutler on your side Ted! Reports saying meeting tonight is to reiterate his non-inclusion. Let's hope so. As you say middle order fine
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-11 18:22:43	.@almurray if only Pietersen had respectfully retired on 318* in solidarity for your stellar efforts last week Al, eh? #318
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-11 18:23:35	@TeddyCutler Exactly. It's definitely a good story. His problem is the clamour only comes from people who can't pick him!
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-11 18:36:28	How about instead of #KP England look with open eyes at @AlexHales1? Guy's got 639 runs in 8 FC games. Oh and is an opener, which they need
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-10 14:52:46	Phenomenal from @ExeterChiefs . WHAT a result. How good would be for #rugby if they make the playoffs?! Some tasty fixtures lining up...
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-11 21:02:59	@willburton22 he's also set to go to the IPL knockouts and has cashed in against a side that hasn't won for 2 years.

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-11 21:08:13	Reports saying Pietersen told he won't be picked. Well done England for staying strong despite madness. @willburton22 might need an update!
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-11 21:11:16	@willburton22 check Aggers and TMS. Unlikely to be wrong with BBC double-sourcing protocol...
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-11 21:17:15	@willburton22 if he has been told he will never be selected again by Strauss as reported 10 mins ago he has no choice. His dream is over
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-11 21:21:15	Bit awkward that @ECB_cricket are tweeting the best of Pietersen's shots today having just told him he'll never play for them...again #KP
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-11 21:27:24	@willburton22 completely, utterly and totally disagree. We shall resume tomorrow after Strauss has had his say in the lion's den
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-05-11 21:29:41	Great sign off from @theanalyst on @bbc5live Pietersen "used to have an X-factor and now he has an I-factor" #KP #cricket

633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-01 22:09:01	Uh oh. Looks bad for Cipriani this alleged incident. Too many players letting Lancaster down at the moment. #RWC #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-01 22:12:04	"I think I've got that trust from the coaches now." Quotes from Cipriani on PA only an hour ago... Oh dear. #backtothedrawingboard #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-01 08:28:07	Interesting. Doubt it'll affect England selection as joining post World Cup but would SL have picked before? #rugby  https://t.co/q37JWXYGCX
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-01 09:29:03	Recording the last episode of @podcastrugby series tonight. Come on in for our #AvivaPremFinal review and round up of the season. #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-01 10:58:49	When was the last time England had a bowler who was class against the tail? Been like this for years! #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-01 11:30:09	@EmmaMKelleher no chance
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-02 09:15:41	Last breakdown of the season. Lots of chat and our summary of the #AvivaPremFinal and the @premrugby season! #rugby https://t.co/XVRlhRvExy
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-05 17:21:07	People need to stop queueing at bars... When did this madness start!? http://t.co/o53BhlMJ8I
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-06 20:17:44	Dani Alves being such a great bloke here... #ChampionsLeagueFinal
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-07 18:30:59	Wiggo needs his Hampton Court throne back! What a complete legend. #MyHour #UCIHourRecord #Wiggins
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-07 09:33:25	Exactly right. Remove the veils &amp; maybe #rugby isn't the gentleman's game we all profess about. Transparency please! https://t.co/P7HrZnxHma
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-08 19:37:59	@DerrenBrown bulb
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-09 13:00:51	Oh bloody hell... #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-10 10:43:46	100 days to go until @rugbyworldcup and the coverage has been ramped up already in the Nationals. Ooo it's time to get excited #rugby #RWC15
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-09 19:43:39	Right. Who had England by 210 in the sweepstake? Thought not. Superb #Buttler #Root #Rashid #Finn #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-09 14:18:08	@BumbleCricket there is an R68 that starts in Richmond too - for his next run!
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-09 14:43:30	What a quality ton from Root. Some glorious shots in there. Now to make it a big 'un #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-09 14:49:11	Brilliant innings from Root but he's definitely missed out there. 24 overs left!! Plenty to do #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-09 15:15:53	This is where we see the progress with new attitude. Yes 1st game but must bat the 50 and post 300+ now. Buttler to lead the charge #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-09 15:17:50	@TeddyCutler happy with new approach Ted but it must be adaptable not blind hitting. Has been great so far. Now the test
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-09 15:19:42	@TeddyCutler he played perfectly. But needed to stay in and get 150+. 100 not the standard anymore.
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-09 16:29:58	@TeddyCutler looks like they're passing the test!
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-09 16:43:56	A hattrick ball hit for 6 to reach 400. Welcome to 2015 ODI cricket at last England #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-09 17:21:02	Ooooo Nelly!! England might win an ODI! Long way to go... Gulptill can double up.. #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-12 09:46:55	Season III of waffles back with a bang. #download from #iTunes now for the best ever #comedy #podcast ever ever. @BrekkieWaffles #waffles
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-14 12:59:43	V.interesting game this now. Another test of the new era's approach NZ showed taking wickets is best policy. Could be another closey #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-14 13:01:29	Also a test of the media - will we buy into it or slam England for failing to bat the overs? Sensing some hypocrisy coming... #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-12 19:42:23	@DerrenBrown triangle
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-12 19:54:11	Why are they starting again at 9.10?? Gerrron wi' it lad! Start at 9 surely? #Cricket loves shooting itself in the foot #ENGvNZ @FredBoycott
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-12 20:03:48	Why not just start now kids? Come on!! #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-12 20:15:17	If you're going to lose. Lose like that. Am-a-zing piece of fielding!! #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-12 20:23:12	For once we don't have a deathly dull ODI series. Game on 1-1. Who needs the Aussies, keep the whanau here! #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-14 14:43:26	Big fan of Mark Wood. Pace. Variation. Movement. Enthusiasm. Quirky run-up. Love it #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-14 14:50:30	@ChrisBond11 like the look of Willey too. And that's a difficult sentence to get right...
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-14 15:57:18	Probably need a wicket #punditry #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-14 17:25:31	Did well to keep it that close, England. 20 more runs would have be interesting! #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-15 17:58:16	@AllOutCricket 2006-07 series at the height of England's capitulations I believe
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-15 18:02:34	@AllOutCricket yeah had a quick google but nada.He was sunglassed at long on, smiling double fist-pump before a hands-skyward catch, I think
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-15 18:16:04	@AllOutCricket yes was just tweeting! 2nd innings Brisbane, Flintoff "kamikaze" shot to Langer at long off (not on!), according to cricinfo!
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-15 20:10:54	This is epic from @EnglandRugby u20s. 3rd final in a row. If 2015 doesn't go well then seeds well sowed for 2019 in Japan #WorldRugbyU20s
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-15 19:23:30	Quite a bit of backchat to the ref in this #WorldRugbyU20s Championship. Shut up and play the game. NZ &amp; SA seem worst at the mo... #RSAvENG
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-15 19:26:31	@Juanodendaal NZ questioning decisions throughout in their semi. Need a Nigel Owens type to put these young boys in their place!
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-15 19:30:39	@Juanodendaal seemed to me like the Baby Boks can't handle the heat in the pack at the moment. Always get decisions if you're going forward
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-15 19:32:53	@Juanodendaal not sure I agree. Same for Chisholm try?
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-16 10:09:52	@EmmaMKelleher @surreycricket just saw. Gutted
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-16 18:31:53	I know it makes BBC untold riches but why oh why didn't they just kill off #TopGear with the end of #Clarkson et al. Will never be the same!
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-17 11:45:33	Join @MikeStanton1992 and I for another waffle! Tomorrow.... https://t.co/iKOOzQ4djQ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-17 12:58:25	How about that Pool 5!? @bathrugby @RCTofficiel @leinsterrugby @WaspsRugby that is huge. 2 out of that lot? Wow #ChampionsCup
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-17 13:00:18	Hoping to cover Pool 3 trials and tribulations in the winter. @GlasgowWarriors @SaintsRugby @racing92 @scarlets_rugby - should be a good 'un
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-17 13:04:40	Will be good to see @DanCarter in sunny Glasgow in December! Just in case he's homesick of those bitter Canterbury nights... #ChampionsCup
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-17 13:13:36	Going for Saracens, Toulouse, Clermont, Exeter, Northampton Glasgow, Munster, Leicester, Toulon, Bath #ChampionsCup  https://t.co/SOxU3M13I0
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-17 13:24:28	Introduction of #ChampionsCup was meant to concentrate talent and produce stunners more often. It's working... Love the new comp #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-17 13:54:03	Ominous opening in the ODI #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-17 14:51:36	@Les_Garcons32 I reckon Munster &amp; Leicester will overpower them!
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-17 16:29:31	So this spin-at-the-death plan worked... #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-17 16:38:50	Good comeback from Rashid. This is definitely gettable - Roy to go big today... #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-17 20:01:33	Latest waffles available on #iTunes. Much to discuss with bad adverts, birthday parties and more bonk newz on the agenda! #breakfastwaffles
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-17 20:55:47	Absolutely fantastic @englandcricket win. Shows how far they've come! Root and Morgan ðð»ðð» #ENGvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-19 16:54:00	Birthday trip to @oldvictheatre to see High Society this evening! Well did you evah... #theatre
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-18 20:59:36	@Les_Garcons32 you're right. Scrap Bath and Leicester.
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-20 20:23:43	England U20s didn't seem to have quality in clutch moments tonight â let's hope history doesn't repeat itself in 4 months... #NZvENG #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-20 20:26:48	Despite the clamour over Iaone for #NZ I'm not a fan â might be a decent young player but attitude stinks. Cheap shots, backchat etc #rugby
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-19 19:49:22	Great first half of High Society @oldvictheatre! More to come... #intheround #theatre http://t.co/KWZzWPTLKo
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-18 21:25:58	@Les_Garcons32 potentially yeah
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-20 09:53:45	Well if that doesn't sum up the new era.... 7-1 1st over! #EngvNZ
633078692	willgkelleher	2015-06-20 18:30:29	Hats off to Bairstow. Brilliant performance &amp; what a series win. NZ been amazing tourists. Who'd have had Eng down to win in Feb?! #ENGvNZ
