63810113	SabbyGents	2012-11-28 04:23:45	Debating on whether to do this rimas assignment or not. That shits a joke.
63810113	SabbyGents	2012-11-28 04:26:27	If these sheets were the states, and you were miles away, I'd fold them end over end to bring you closer to me.

63810113	SabbyGents	2012-11-28 16:54:45	It amazes me that this guy is still trying to teach and absolutely no one is listening.
63810113	SabbyGents	2012-11-29 03:06:58	There's never a dull moment in the Ryan household. I've never heard this much conversation about foreskin in my life.

63810113	SabbyGents	2012-12-01 16:45:00	The depressing music playing right now is really not helping my situation here. Like really? #comeon

63810113	SabbyGents	2012-12-03 02:12:21	@rub_soul @gub_grov @mub_tol how much more obviouse could it get?
63810113	SabbyGents	2012-12-03 02:25:29	I should probably crank out more than 2 sentences per hour and a half. #killme #fuckSTP
63810113	SabbyGents	2012-12-03 02:26:40	@sub_gent @rub_soul @gub_grov @mub_tol apparently not obviouse enough...

63810113	SabbyGents	2013-10-18 01:43:45	I'm scarred for life by what I just saw.....I never want to see a play ever again

63810113	SabbyGents	2013-10-28 23:13:45	Sometimes I feel bad for sending out so many mass snapchats but then I'm like I don't really care someone has to answer eventually.
63810113	SabbyGents	2013-10-31 03:50:13	There's like 300 kids running in a herd around campus screaming "let's go Red Sox" #lovemycity
63810113	SabbyGents	2013-10-31 03:57:03	Just keeping up with that champion city status #Boston

63810113	SabbyGents	2013-11-10 20:41:05	I can't wait for winter break because it's gonna be like senior year again only everyone's alcohol tolerance will be at an all time high.
63810113	SabbyGents	2013-11-08 22:01:01	Bringing Ally to stonehill this weekend was the worst thing I ever thought of doing, so glad it's not happening anymore.
63810113	SabbyGents	2013-11-12 03:16:14	Just liked some of my own Instagram pictures from a while ago to make it 11 likes. I'm not proud but I did what needed to be done. #guilty
63810113	SabbyGents	2013-11-12 03:19:59	I've also been in bed since like 8 so my life is just pathetic today.

63810113	SabbyGents	2013-11-29 02:02:10	I find it concerning that my family started thanksgiving dinner at 2 and they're still going strong. Fuckin Italians.
63810113	SabbyGents	2013-12-03 02:58:00	“@Michaela_Toland: Rose and Sabrina are currently getting drunk specifically to do their English project #Shots4Honig 😂” remember when 😂😂😂😂😂

63810113	SabbyGents	2013-11-30 19:42:34	I should get off the couch and be productive or social but I don't know if I care enough to make the effort
63810113	SabbyGents	2013-12-01 14:55:47	The amount of work that I didn't do at home that I now have to do tonight and tomorrow night is ridiculous.

63810113	SabbyGents	2014-04-18 12:44:17	Some kid just tripped and ate shit outside the daycare 😂
63810113	SabbyGents	2014-04-18 12:45:57	I am a horrible person for thinking that it was funny but it's really early and I'm tired so it's justified.

63810113	SabbyGents	2014-04-20 18:07:44	@A_Tresca same! We always find excuses not to go but Ria wasn't buying it this year

63810113	SabbyGents	2014-04-22 20:09:00	The bad news is I'm going to bomb this stats test, the good news is that I'm going to a bruins playoff game! The F doesn't seem so bad now.
63810113	SabbyGents	2014-04-22 23:03:44	I got out of a 3 hour class in less than an hour and I don't think I entirely bombed the test so today's good.

63810113	SabbyGents	2014-08-24 00:43:03	It's really sad that when fireworks go off in Watertown we have to wonder if it's gunshots in the distance...
63810113	SabbyGents	2014-08-24 14:55:28	If I don't start packing I don't have to go right?
63810113	SabbyGents	2014-08-24 15:00:03	@allyweiner yeah I love you and I can't wait to see you but I'm not ready to leave yet 😭
