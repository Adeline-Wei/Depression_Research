66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-03-05 02:08:43	@WirelessGolf what is the proper left hand grip? I'm a 4 handicap right now but I'd like to be a scratch player.
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-03-05 02:14:30	@WirelessGolf my ball position for long irons is more middle, maybe even a bit forward
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-03-05 02:49:35	@WirelessGolf sorry one last question. Best advice for hitting cut shots?
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-03-04 14:16:33	@jordanpogon High level view. As a golfer, it will help you connect and play with like - golfers who match your skill level, playing style..

66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-03-05 02:17:45	@WirelessGolf do you recommend a stronger left hand grip and taking the club back more in 1 piece at the start of the takeaway?
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-03-05 02:22:21	@WirelessGolf reason I ask is with a very weak or neutral grip I tend to flip the club causing a big hook sometimes

66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-04-08 01:10:29	@WirelessGolf Green side bunkers. Sometimes when the sand is really fluffy, I have a very hard time because my leading edge just digs in
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-04-08 01:11:03	@WirelessGolf also when the sand is really hard and compact, my club sometimes bounces up and skulls the ball a bit, so frustrating
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-04-08 01:15:22	Let's go #UConn #MarchMadness #NCAAChampionship
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-04-08 01:16:52	@WirelessGolf do I set my wrist early and swing more vertical?
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-04-08 01:20:50	#UConn has a sick backcourt
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-04-08 01:28:16	@WirelessGolf when it's hard compact sand, and I hit it 3 to 5 inches behind the ball, my club bounces off and skulls the ball. So closer?
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-04-08 01:31:36	@WirelessGolf ok that makes sense. So 9 degrees of bounce is good for my wedge?
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-04-08 01:43:22	@WirelessGolf it's a 58
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-04-08 01:52:27	@WirelessGolf the sand here is mostly tight and compact. Not fluffy at all
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-04-07 01:11:26	@Lexi congratulations on your 1st major. @themichellewie way to battle today, I was glued to the tv watching you 2 go at it. Big Fan!

66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-06-09 02:48:52	@AMillare @_Jibran_ freaking parker and Duncan missed 4 straight free throws. Smh
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-06-09 02:59:29	@_Jibran_ @AMillare Spurs will win game 3 and possibly game 4
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-06-09 03:00:16	@AMillare @_Jibran_ I was cussing out parker and Duncan for missing those free throws, so mad
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2014-06-09 03:07:43	This game hurt. Guess this is how Jazz fans felt when they played against Jordan. I still have faith that we will bounce back. #GoSpursGo

66257390	MichaelHuh3	2015-03-11 02:51:14	@GuyKawasaki ok, just thought I'd ask. Thank you for the reply. I'm a huge fan!
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2015-03-11 03:06:21	@GuyKawasaki I was always taught that you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. I'd rather shoot and miss than not shoot at all 👍😊
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2015-03-11 03:07:00	@GuyKawasaki do you golf by chance?
66257390	MichaelHuh3	2015-03-11 03:18:53	@GuyKawasaki oh I've seen some violence on the golf course lol. Yes, no guts no glory. I'm a swing for the fences type

66257390	MichaelHuh3	2015-03-11 20:38:45	@jtimberlake, would be thrilled to have you as an advisor for Golfalong, a disruptive tech startup for golf. Equity offered. Yes/No?
