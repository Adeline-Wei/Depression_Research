66321578	nitintyagi2012	2014-05-14 15:52:13	But there is very thin line between being critical and being cynical. Sometimes #AAP leaders and supporters seem to be going cynical.

66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-03-27 09:33:13	@ArvindKejriwal @AamAadmiParty is going to miss a huge opportunity if they dont resove current crisis amicably. 2/2
66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-03-27 09:35:04	First time in last 2 yrs, i doubt @ArvindKejriwal capability as a leader. He cannot manage different opinions in @AamAadmiParty ?
66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-03-27 09:36:07	@AamAadmiParty should never become a one man party like BJP or Congress. Thats the only difference.
66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-03-27 16:26:46	I ve been a keen supporter of @ArvindKejriwal but I perceive him to ve wrong at this moment. I am not the only one.

66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-04-21 19:00:49	Shame on @ArvindKejriwal &amp; team @AashishKhetan for branding #PIL as industry. Some days back you were taking credits for #bhushans PIL.
66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-04-20 12:30:23	Current state of @AamAadmiParty has disheartened many suppoters like me. And what we can see is that @ArvindKejriwal and company is at fault

66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-04-23 11:50:30	So @ArvindKejriwal is demanding @PMOIndia to go to every farmer to stop #FarmerSuicide n a farmer suicided in front of #AK. He does nothing.
66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-04-23 11:52:34	@ArvindKejriwal @AamAadmiParty became one of them sooner than they thought. You are a thick skinned political party now.
66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-04-24 21:08:53	I agree with @Ed_Miliband holding @David_Cameron partly responsible for libya and #Medcrisis . So is @UKLabour responsible for #IraqCrisis
66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-04-26 18:07:47	How safe are the highrises in north India which is very seisemic prone area? Does @PMOIndia #urbanDevMin has safety measures in place?
66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-04-26 18:09:16	Prayers with those effected in #NepalEarthquake . #StandwithNepal

Has #TRAI lost all its senses and revealed the identity of 1mn+ indians? Its breach of privacy.
66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-05-19 09:44:44	I was never ashamed of being Indian @PMOIndia @narendramodi , neither my parents and ancesters were. #ModiInsultsIndia

66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-05-19 09:48:02	We were never ashamed of being Indian @PMOIndia @narendramodi . Dont project urself bigger than the nation.

66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-05-19 04:54:20	@ArvindKejriwal The man just seems to do whatever he thinks without carefully thinking in decisions.

66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-05-19 04:58:04	#Damini had to take that bus because autorikshaw wala refused to go. Right to refusal is not in public interest. Jago @ArvindKejriwal jago.
66321578	nitintyagi2012	2015-05-20 12:38:53	Politics is impossible without discourse. Politics is to win over ur opponents/ememies through discourse. @ArvindKejriwal needs to learn.
