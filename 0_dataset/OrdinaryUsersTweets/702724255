702724255	rarajasper	2013-04-24 12:25:36	Leaving work and I've achieved more than I usually do in a full 7 hours chained to my desk.... how strange?!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-04-24 16:44:02	Just because I can walk does not mean I can run... yet. Brain and enthusiasm levels take note please. No more Fran chasing!

702724255	rarajasper	2013-04-28 08:41:38	So many empty bottles... I've abandoned cleaning and watching Frasier instead.

702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-02 22:05:06	Ah it got late and tomorrow I have a pre-meeting, a meeting, then a post- meeting meeting! Interspersed with a lunchtime swim. Zzzzz

702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-04 14:36:19	Oh yeh, playing temple run on a train always induces immediate travel sickness! And yet I persist every journey...
702724255	rarajasper	2013-04-28 09:17:15	There goes Crane down the drain...
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-04 18:26:13	Why I am so cold? Aha I've taken the quilted lining out of my coat and am wearing fishnets... Brr spring?
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-05 00:58:24	The Hobbit :-) watching with my mum! Yay for late film nights...
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-05 08:56:54	This morning I had to borrow my mum's glasses to locate my glasses. Eye sight fail! #blurry
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-05 15:04:33	I've just got stupidly lost... Instead of going left, left, straight on I went left, left, left, straight on... #epicfail
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-07 13:58:37	I've just fallen asleep with my face crumpling an interview transcript! Time for coffee and smoothing of paperwork on my return.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-05 18:12:51	BBQ and G&amp;Ts :-) bank holidays are amazing!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-08 12:55:33	I don't want to go into a three hour meeting... #tantrum
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-06 07:04:43	Why is it when I'm lucky enough to have a lie in I wake early?! #bankholiday first world problem! To the gardening...

702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-10 20:49:54	Just found popcorn on my top... Essential news to share. Nice pint of ale in Kro however!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-07 19:28:56	So I managed a pretty respectable jog / walk combo this evening along the cycle path. Go healing foot, go...
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-09 12:59:15	Whilst it is possible to dry off a little with a T-shirt there is no substituting a towel...#damp
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-11 01:08:25	Why is the kitchen so far away? Then again it may be certain death to try and cook after this much wine?! Zzz
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-11 09:59:49	Finger somehow trapped itself in a door, stupid clumsiness!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-09 19:40:40	Argh I can't stop waffling on and on like a babbling brook or a stuck record. . .
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-12 14:07:22	Flared jeans are not ideal wet weather attire #soaked
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-12 16:53:59	I would love to attend a masquerade ball and have David Bowie sing to me ala Labyrinth. But not a Poirot ball, too much death!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-13 22:31:22	Cold cold night. Resorted to a hot water bottle and extra socks... Hurry along warm weather, enough already!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-12 19:51:53	Kindergarten Cop seems to be happen to my eyes... and my brain is not complaining?!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-12 20:26:32	Why am I hungry? Lunch and tea have failed to happen...That will be why then!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-12 21:04:13	Father Ted is on ... a lovely end to a great weekend! Yay.. :)
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-14 15:26:21	There is no hope for my MPhil! I only scored a measly 5. BBC News - 10 questions on grammar http://t.co/Vr1PRArTRC

702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-13 07:18:27	Getting out of bed is shockingly hard this morning but the sudden dawning horror I have a meeting in an hour has helped... Shit!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-14 20:21:29	Just been gardening in the rain. A bit akin to Singin' in the Rain but with more earth worms and less umbrellas.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-13 11:15:34	Trying to remind myself that organising things can be fun... ish...Ah!! Heading off for a calming lunchtime stroll!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-13 12:38:57	I've turned into an apple snob as stating "I only like Braeburns" got me suitable teased in the kitchen at work...

702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-18 13:48:55	I shouldn't try and be funny, it doesn't work. Nor should I wear heavy eye makeup for a rainy BBQ. #pandaface
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-13 14:16:55	@skel42 Excellent :) I once was a Granny Smith lover but my allegiance has changed in recent months.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-13 14:18:55	Oh a storm... Exciting thunder is happening and purple bruised sky :)
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-13 15:38:08	@skel42 It was extremely heavy rain, even by Manchester weather standards :)
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-15 00:09:27	@squilbee Cool. Yep, quite a few I had to guess and not correctly as it turns out ;-)
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-17 07:25:51	Busy day of meetings and yet I decide now is a good time to break my self imposed Twitter ban... come on work brain... focus!!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-19 11:52:14	@skel42 Sunday win indeed :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-19 13:35:23	I have a bad case of the dropsies .. another thing added to the hangover horrors!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-17 20:12:50	Time to make your way home when every other word comes out slightly wrong #tipsy word/ name finding difficulties!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-19 19:01:53	Good party times and now BED!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-18 09:54:49	Off shopping with an imaginary baby crocodile that I have to hold in my arms... embarrassment level is going through the roof!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-18 14:31:08	Sat with beer :-) with friends, special friends ;-)
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-20 07:58:15	Amazing what decent sleep has done to improve my mood and restore my ability to find hilarity in ridiculous situations. Hangover... over!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-20 13:01:52	Lunchtime swim has been completed - mission successful. Now I can eat all the food!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-20 19:28:13	Very chilled as pints now Game of Thrones.. Can't get much better than this!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-22 08:23:10	I want this bike, my precious! I even dreamt about it last night...time to do some sums. http://t.co/ChuNj2WfGm
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-22 10:46:13	Good God! Fasting is hard work today! Note to self: hangovers are not conducive to this lifestyle plan.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-22 13:41:55	This is interesting. I want to try and trick it! BBC News - The curious story of how the lie detector came to be http://t.co/EhyzXnbS5C
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-22 21:54:15	Such a mixture of relief and paranoia to discover the van slowly driving along right behind you is actually a police van!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-23 08:33:24	Clearly I ate in the dark this morning in a manner similar to that of a four year old! I am covered in porridge.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-23 11:44:22	Off for a walk around Whitworth park... It's bloody freezing despite the sunshine!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-21 10:47:39	Listening to Mezzanine by Massive Attack. Still one of my favourite albumns and it's helping me stay put at my desk....
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-21 12:04:55	Browsing beautiful hybrid bikes as seriously considering entering a triathlon... once I get fitter!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-21 15:17:15	It's got to that time of the month where I'm reduced to eating random food combinations from the dregs of my cupboard! Hurry up payday...
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-21 23:40:47	Jesus, I had a rogue Mr Bingley the hamster for a whole 30 mins. Calm down adrenalin, he is safe and rescued from under the bed!

702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-24 12:24:20	@bex_spence Yep, plan and I'll be on trains to Scotland with Game of Thrones as well to read :) Hope you have a good one.. stupid rain xx
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-26 08:28:20	After an 11hour incredisleep I feel recharged ready for a day of reading and relaxing times.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-26 09:18:26	Hirundo Rustica is the Latin name for a Swallow. I need to memorise facts more as Granny has just impressed me with this nugget :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-24 15:30:02	FREEDOM! Four days off work :) Plan for tonight: babysit; pack and perhaps raid a beer or two...
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-24 15:59:03	Sod off wet... I have a date to play football in a bit!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-26 09:36:10	I'll never be able to memorise enough Latin names. We are on a walk looking at flowers and the names are baffling me...
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-26 15:01:47	Where my uncle got a traffic bollard from I can't imagine but it's been a god send for practising my car reversing skills!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-24 19:31:42	There was snow at my relatives in Scotland yesterday... snow! CHRIST! Need to rethink my packing.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-26 15:40:26	Wow, the characters are betrothed and wed young in the novel Game of Thrones. At twelve my dad banned me from everything, especially boys!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-26 15:42:07	He mainly banned me from wearing makeup, which was good as I was channeling Pat Butcher!

702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-26 19:37:39	Just when I think I couldn't love Niles Crane more he turns up with a lurcher dog as a Maris substitute :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-26 19:43:32	Oh I thought that too soon... Now he had a parrot called Baby! Owch lol
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-26 20:37:19	Time for an evening stroll to check out the lambs. . . It's so bright up north at this time of year.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-26 20:48:30	Ah midges nooooo... Time for solitude marred slightly by biting beasties!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-26 21:15:27	Peaceful loch side... what can't been seen are all the bats flying around! :-) http://t.co/iie1LM9q8i
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-27 10:52:38	Last night I discovered Tuc biscuits taste wrong as an adult... made for a poor midnight feast.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-27 13:02:46	My gran doesn't like sitting down for long! We're off for a walk in the rain... at least there'll be no midges today!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-24 21:29:06	Just remembered I can set multiple alarm timers on my phone so getting up panic averted! Bring on the squeaky cheese.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-27 14:25:12	Yay finally watching the extended version of The Two Towers! Rainy day fun :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-28 11:15:01	Successful first drive along Loch Tummel to reach Pitlochry. Now waiting for the train and contemplating a large G&amp;T!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-25 00:01:54	Yay partial success, clothes dry but not my hair! Decided sleep might be a tad overrated tonight. Fiction books, how I have missed you.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-28 15:21:32	How can I still have another three hours left on the train?! Nap time...
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-25 04:48:28	Made my train by a mere two minutes... Quite a stunning sunny morning #holiday
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-25 06:22:50	There is a whole new quality of light at this time of day. My phone not capturing it but stunning countryside :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-25 09:45:25	@lizuardo1 Death comes to Pemberley and the first two Game of Thrones books :-) what are you reading this half term? X
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-28 19:21:03	From peaceful nights watching Frasier to being hit on the head with toys and Garfield cartoons! What is this shit?! Where is Dr Who!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-28 19:35:42	Monkey puzzle tree game... turns out I hate losing! http://t.co/9sXz1t06UP
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-28 20:33:58	Lying down and trying to pair socks isn't working out well for me...
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-29 22:08:32	Ah drinking wine with my housemate... I feel like an tipsy agony aunt! :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-29 23:27:39	More wine and peanuts! Oh dear Christ!!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-25 12:29:08	Overexcited about arriving :-) sunny picnic!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-25 13:40:21	@lizuardo1 yep liking it a lot. Ah cool, that book is good plus Iain Banks is brilliant :-) x

702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-30 07:50:59	Payday! I need lucozade and a dark cool room to hide out in!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-31 08:26:25	What stunning sun! I am overdressed, as usual. Roll on 5 pm then pub time :)
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-31 12:30:44	Salad and smoked salmon...healthy eating has commenced! Next step... running at the weekend!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-29 06:14:49	Oh exciting... I'm enjoying this book a lot! Matthew Rhys to play Mr Darcy http://t.co/kOOf6OG5Qa
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-29 07:17:32	Approaching work... Urgh!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-31 15:44:08	Pub time soon and no babysitting. But must remember this time last week I couldn't afford to eat! Not even cheap custard creams...
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-31 15:56:56	Monkey enjoying a drink... http://t.co/zeaCxgXfWy
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-31 17:55:11	Wine for £7.95 a bottle in Kro... What more can I say?!  I'm finding everything hilarious, oh dear god!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-31 20:51:00	Apparently I say a lot of things that should NEVER be said out loud! So quoth my housemate as we drink wine...
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-31 20:52:47	And watching Britain is full of tossers! My brain is slowly atrophying!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-31 21:32:55	PEANUTS... Take two!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-31 22:28:59	Now sweet and salted popcorn... Oh botheration!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-31 23:07:09	Woo woo Berlin marathon weekend trip planned :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2013-05-31 23:20:40	Watching the film MacGruber... with rum...That is all!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-06-01 00:46:31	Taming Mr Bingley is far harder than I thought. I should have named him Mr Darcy as it would suit his personality better!?!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-06-01 07:59:16	New hair today... Woo hoo! A little overexcited :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2013-06-01 10:01:37	The smell of wild garlic always reminds me of summer. Love the countryside!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-06-01 13:20:53	Mission to Stockport to find some new heels. Yay healing foot :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2013-06-01 13:28:03	Perhaps not! Too many people out there (urgh) and it's lovely out...time for a country walk instead.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-06-01 15:27:25	"I feel thin, sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread" Bilbo clearly knew all about hangover paranoia!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-06-01 19:41:58	My housemate just described me as a "big ball of stress". I think she may have hit the nail on the head! Heels wooo...
702724255	rarajasper	2013-06-02 08:33:52	Sitting outside in the sunshine trying to do physio exercises on my foot. Heels were a mistake!

702724255	rarajasper	2013-10-24 10:27:30	On a training course. Totally feels like I'm back at school with the enforced group role play!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-10-27 19:36:14	Fran the dog really dislikes fireworks, especially the screeching ones. Gave me a shock as pretty darn close to our door!

702724255	rarajasper	2013-11-18 16:37:16	Opps, should've been using my inhaler at least 4 times more per day. No wonder climbing stairs has been an ordeal!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-11-18 16:44:38	Never ask a small child if they have a frog in their throat. The look of horror and questions about how the frog got there are too much...

702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-09 13:09:10	Lunch is amazing! Especially when kind people brave the outside world for it on your behalf.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-09 17:34:59	More corrections back. I know I should feel grateful but in reality each chapter feels harder to climb than the Cliffs of Insanity!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-09 18:48:03	Not sure I'd travel 30 miles back to reclaim my phone for the night as my boss has just done. Who am I kidding, of course I would!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-09 20:29:32	It does make me happy to see Leve lights and tree up but sad about the massive fence around them. It's just not York!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-09 20:57:55	Brain drained. Eyes gritty. Mood has been sunnier. Time for bed!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-07 21:26:05	Very cold! Brr...
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-07 23:05:10	@squilbee hehe. To my eternal shame I think I blamed it on the dog :-(
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-07 23:40:51	@squilbee oh and I bought him a lot of chocolate hungry hippos!

702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-08 10:04:16	Strange how little Chemistry A Level I can remember. Interesting stuff! Why do we value gold? http://t.co/5xmRmYZzwI

702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-11 15:23:36	Submitted my thesis .... now to beer!! Perhaps in bed though.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-11 18:38:48	I've had to be persuaded to bathe by my housemate as slumped on the sofa. I appear to have regressed somewhat.

702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-13 14:07:16	There were only three instructions to follow to make Angel Delight. Somehow I managed to go horribly dreadfully wrong.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-12 08:21:54	Teenagers behind me on the bus discussing the benefits of driving with no insurance. "As long as you don't crash it's fine". Er??

702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-12 20:15:19	Cough cough cough. It truly is, as the kid calls it, a "house of cough!"
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-13 08:13:01	I've been up since six having to engage in play with a small boy. Wah. However the electronic spider is quite amazing!

702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-13 08:29:32	Four year olds need to be reminded to go to the toilet a lot. I like the way the adult brain blocks this humiliation out!

702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-15 13:22:09	Well I do think that the 2009 TV version of Emma was far sweeter and an improvement on the film.
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-15 13:59:47	Ciaran wants a newspaper with lots of people in it and lots of dogs as well. Children's minds are very silly.

702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-17 16:43:02	Ekk! Christmas meal time and I'm very excited!!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-17 16:51:36	Why is the extended version of The Hobbit not cheaper? Almost like the shops have a captive audience or something...
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-16 11:45:56	Just braved an Iceland shop in search of pie. Major error!

702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-24 23:04:56	I'm sleeping in my childhood bed. This feels weird yet I did some amazing star systems on the ceiling with glow stars!

702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-25 19:42:01	First drop kick wine spill of the day and it wasn't me for once. At least the carpet is dark red!!

702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-29 20:47:38	Another Miss Marple. I'm becoming increasingly addicted to Agatha Christie tv adaptations...
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-29 20:55:28	Oh my god! My bank balance! How?!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-30 11:43:30	Getting slightly scared about the drive home over the Pennines. Wish the weather would be better!
702724255	rarajasper	2013-12-30 12:11:14	Talking Heads and bacon/egg butties. My mum wins Mondays.

702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-02 20:12:05	Watching Death Comes to Pemberley in bed. First day back at work was unexpectedly exhausting!

702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-03 19:58:30	However, I do plan to read an awful lot more this year now I'm free from studying. All the books!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-06 09:07:19	Why didn't I have an earlier night. So sleepy.

702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-06 22:45:05	My early night is in danger of veering towards a late one. A warming cup of tea and an excellent book are to blame.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-07 21:24:05	Why does it take so long to get home from town. A transporter machine straight to my bed is called for.

702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-15 17:45:39	Suppose I'd better stir myself to make tea. . . Oof! #firstworldproblems
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-19 21:07:42	Ekk new Sunday viewing #TheMusketeers
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-20 09:04:20	Managed to get the five year old dressed and to school. Sadly I've neglected to even brush my own hair in the chaos!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-20 12:43:31	Slump! Why, oh why did I eat my lunch this early?
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-20 12:52:10	Alas, back to the endless telephone chasing... roll on wine o'clock!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-21 07:30:59	Somehow I appear to be still nailed to the bed. Must. Get. Up!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-23 08:14:59	Decided to wait until after the rush hour to start my big drive. Procrastination masquerading as logical reasoning!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-23 08:15:47	@lizuardo1 @thegirlkaty I'm tempted to start this also. Lovely times x
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-23 10:47:18	Waiting at the doctors as they've lost my repeat prescription... I want to leave for my holidays!!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-23 11:27:31	Finally off to Foss... Yay!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-23 17:47:45	Arrived. Woop! Snow storms and hail... Interesting conditions.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-24 19:53:42	"I mean I have been keeping myself on the shelf lately. I'm feeling a little like the good china." Daphne #Frasier
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-24 22:28:14	Boiling hot! In Scotland? What sweet madness is this? Aha yes. A hot water bottle/ electric blanket combination wins the day.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-24 18:07:00	@susielizmartin thanks. Happy snowy weekend :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-24 18:10:47	In the last 24 hours I've cooked more meals than in the whole of December and January. Slightly sobering fact!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-25 23:05:11	The stars in the sky are absolutely amazing! If it wasn't -3 degrees I would stay out for ages.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-26 20:10:04	Woody Harrelson is in Frasier. My evening is complete.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-25 14:58:38	Just seen a red squirrel! They are lovely creatures.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-25 15:09:03	Not the best drive with my granny. Absolutely torrential rain so my entreaties of "look at the view" were rather redundant.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-27 17:09:00	Finished reading Girl with a Pearl Earring in one fell swoop today. Very much enjoyed it!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-27 21:28:10	Begone now Azog the Defiler! As my Granny says "too plastic"...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-28 22:23:09	I could murder a mug of Purl right now! http://t.co/XZ8CLC0xBZ
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-27 21:42:42	How the wind howls! It is howling with wolf-voices! #Tolkien #Scotland
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-26 09:43:58	Sideways sleet and gales. Yuck! Today is a day for watching Lord of the Rings in the warm.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-26 11:54:33	I am turning into a biscuit. A giant digestive biscuit.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-27 20:14:39	@lizuardo1 sounds amazing! Happy days indeed. Hope you enjoy them :-) x
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-27 20:16:59	Suddenly finding The Hobbit quite an emotional watch ... Don't be mean to Bilbo Baggins!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-28 16:10:46	Er, what now?! Sense and sensorbility: the book that lets you feel your protagonist's pain http://t.co/sOcAh67MrR
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-29 09:39:59	The beck has flooded the drive. I am in danger I not being able to leave tomorrow. Go away rain!!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-29 20:25:14	Haha, just laughed a little to much at this! Frasier and Niles - Expensive lunch http://t.co/rWvWIzrAVD via @youtube
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-01 21:37:43	Watching Warm Bodies. Enjoying it so far but may have chosen the wrong time to tuck into pizza.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-30 07:08:02	Oh god! Why didn't I pack last night?!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-02 00:04:06	Midnight and red wine. A countryside walk tomorrow is looking less and less feasible...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-30 17:31:31	For a brief moment I was happy about my return to the city. Then the creeping dread of boarding the 192 bus hit me!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-30 17:47:17	Despite being legal tender Scottish bank notes are not accepted on buses!? To the pub Jeeves, and don't spare the horses!!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-30 21:30:42	I appear to be out and awake later than I've been for the past week of holiday. Amazing steak and wine!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-30 21:54:59	Wow it's cold! Hurry up bus.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-01 15:50:24	I finally have music on my phone. Bus rides no longer feel like endurance events sent to test me!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-01-30 22:46:27	That coffee I had after tea was a mistake. Chatting nonsense to my housemate... Endless chatter.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-02 10:37:19	I am off on an adventure... In the sunshine.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-02 14:46:23	I didn't know before today that the Trans Pennine Trail goes through Reddish Vale Country Park. http://t.co/I4tYPmUmDL
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-02 17:02:39	Six mile walk with a friendly robin and my favourite colour of flower. Only thing missing was a Sunday roast/pint. http://t.co/s170JwJcUS
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-04 09:09:18	Finally watched No Country for Old Men last night. What a great film!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-04 09:45:36	Every lunchtime I shall leave my desk and explore quiet reading spots around campus. I need to up my book consumption this year.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-04 19:02:06	Words cannot express how tasty these are. Sadly they belong to the kid... It's not fair! http://t.co/rRxx7PwIdr
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-04 21:13:12	The Eater of Socks has struck again...grnf, grnf... I love this Pratchett character and apt as now have numerous single socks from one wash!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-05 08:40:13	Today there is sunshine and Hot Chip to cheer my bus journey. Unusually content!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-05 08:42:50	Unfortunately a lady has just sat down on my blueberries! #berrybath
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-07 18:56:58	Cheese on hot crumpets and wine. Utter bliss!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-06 07:20:13	If I click my heels three times can I wish to go back to bed? #thursday
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-07 19:50:45	Me and the kid are discussing the pros and cons of living in a houseboat. Apparently we'll be ok as can both wear armbands?!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-07 20:00:13	I've been handed a piece of paper and a  coloured pen. Marvels are expected of me!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-07 20:30:56	My attempts to draw what the kid wanted were met with derision. At least the dog still loves me. http://t.co/pEurirDHXo
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-09 13:24:53	The view from my bedroom window is snow blowing sideways. Time to hibernate for the day.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-08 19:11:33	Bought my hamster an amazing new Rotastak space station cage with many levels. Yet he prefers sleeping in the wheel. Odd lovely creature!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-10 18:10:05	I need new glasses to be legal to drive. This is catastrophic to my finances, stupid short sighted eyes. Balls!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-10 18:11:19	@bex_spence haha. It has eased off now. Will be well for York next weekend!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-08 21:28:36	Reading the Flappy Bird reviews is far more entertaining than playing the damn game.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-11 22:19:30	Happy dance that I am going to bed... Roll on the weekend!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-09 20:48:16	Go away sore throat... Roll on Spring!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-11 12:06:00	Frustrating morning but soon time to have a relaxing read.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-11 12:34:55	So cute... Zoo Security Cam Catches Panda Playing In The Snow http://t.co/jKXzEZcqWY via @hellogiggles
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-11 14:28:08	I'm experiencing such a bad afternoon slump that even my toes ache with weariness.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-13 08:17:50	I got 10/10 on Towel Day quiz: how well do you know the Hitchhiker's Guide http://t.co/PEXWxwO9JE via @GuardianQuiz
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-13 16:47:56	Sat in a meeting. On hearing crickets chirping thinks "what idiot has forgotten to mute their phone". Turns out to have been me!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-13 17:16:42	Wow! New glasses are amazing!!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-13 21:27:27	@susielizmartin happy holidays :-) x
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-13 21:45:03	Just heard the coccyx described as a bum bone... I will adopt this in future discussions about posteriors!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-14 17:36:43	So happy it's the weekend I could weep. But won't. Not on public transport anyway.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-14 18:20:01	Supermarket. People fighting over the last few straggly flowers. Police called. Big fights. Never been so relieved to escape Longsight!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-14 19:28:13	Now the weekend can begin... In a taxi learning how to cross the double roundabout of doom!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-15 14:18:39	The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie. I enjoyed reading it much more than I thought I would. Horrendous rain outside... Next book!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-15 16:18:18	"I don't trust you Lord Loxley." Mr Selfridge finally reaches a decision.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-15 16:20:51	@bex_spence ooh Diana Wynne Jones...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-15 18:29:40	Watching Spirited Away and having snuggles with the boy. Good taste in films for such a tender age! http://t.co/xzgH3ODgWS
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-15 20:17:14	I walked around a small park today and am now in bed. My housemate ran 16 miles earlier and is still up. Minor disparity in energy levels!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-18 19:07:00	Decided to get the last train home then pay a taxi. Boring worry of the night over. . . No 192 bus!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-19 08:48:59	Fast day... Must not smell croissants!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-19 18:03:13	Pizza and beer... fast broken. Epic fail!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-19 18:05:23	Where I am? Oh Ardwick! No wondering I'm hallucinating my planned tea at every turn.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-19 21:10:29	Watching The Adjustment Bureau... 9 minutes in and how did I miss this at the cinema?!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-18 17:10:28	I wish the feeling of relief after a stunningly hard day could be condensed into a can... Perri-Air: http://t.co/MaXSEPqBJp via @youtube

702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-14 19:32:07	Turns out I always drive in the wrong lane on the first roundabout. . . Must do better!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-14 22:55:01	Wine is amazing :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-16 08:00:02	Woken up to the sound of tantrums. Gah!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-16 10:04:50	Too lovely to go into work today... Beautiful light and warm sunshine!

702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-21 09:21:39	One month today will be the first official day of Spring. Heartening thought.

702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-21 11:56:32	What's that you say? A successful day recruiting? Feedback on thesis possibly as early as next week? Now to celebrate... Greggs!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-23 08:29:36	Triffids have taken over the garden! Time to unleash the power tools...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-25 08:22:59	Looking up running training plans. Scary start to a Tuesday!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-25 08:28:04	Another day and no exam results. This waiting is driving me crazy!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-25 17:46:46	I know rainwater can't melt me but still!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-25 17:47:54	Hate hate hate being soggy and sad! But on a lunchtime walk I saw these pretties... http://t.co/3Fj4FIFiCF
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-27 16:44:55	What a lovely day! Good company, tasty food and now Spring sunshine.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-26 12:48:58	£1.67 until payday. This is not enough to even buy a pint! Deep woe!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-28 17:09:34	I'm so happy to be leaving work! Be still my beating heart.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-28 18:29:53	I've bought sherry. I feel like I'm in an episode of Frasier sipping it. I'm listening...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-26 17:08:14	A three mile walk home does not mean I can forgo the three mile run afterwards. Stop sabotaging my plans tired brain!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-26 21:05:29	Ah bed! How I have missed you these last 13 hours...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-28 21:08:22	Watching the original Spider-man DVD whilst babysitting. Pretty scary stuff for this 32 year old!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-28 22:35:40	"It was always going to be a bit of a kick bollocks scramble" I love The Hotel Inspector!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-28 22:42:42	Kid asleep finally! Now to bed, Jeeves, and don't spare the horses.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-02 10:06:04	Watching an episode of Murder, She Wrote called A Virtual Murder. Dated graphics is an understatement!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-28 23:22:21	White blossoms on my walk home today. http://t.co/33x0uxzDBl
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-26 22:14:47	Time to invest in another new hamster cage. Mr Bingley should be renamed Cage Destroyer Extraordinaire!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-02 18:57:56	Poirot is the best to potter to and I don't think I've seen this one. Bonus.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-28 10:02:06	Wow! BBC News - Northern Lights illuminate the UK http://t.co/UmamNjP8Te
702724255	rarajasper	2014-02-27 09:03:08	@lizuardo1 yes payday today :-) so happy. Looking forward to hearing about your travels next week x
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-03 08:32:15	So weather, this is more like it.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-03 09:14:38	I am eating yogurt, berries and seeds #healthy Amazing the impact sunshine has on healthy eating choices.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-04 08:57:45	Another day. Another missed delivery time slot. I have to be at work dammit! For another £10 this hamster cage better be worth it.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-03 20:33:10	Perhaps might leave the coleslaw making until the morning! Sleep head on the bus.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-04 18:57:30	Emergency last weekday pint in pub before Lent.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-03 20:42:04	Off to buy coleslaw ingredients. Farewell fingertips.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-03 22:02:30	@thegirlkaty @lizuardo1 great night. Donut burger starter :-) x
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-04 17:55:08	My new toric contact lenses are amazing. X-ray eyes!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-06 21:57:21	I've thought about my bed today more than is healthy. Hurry up bus journey.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-06 00:41:31	Hamster is whizzing happily around his new abode and it's mercifully quiet so far.... Is this the hopeful end to gnawing nights?
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-09 15:24:51	Reading outside in a beer garden. What a lovely feeling!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-08 11:50:52	@susielizmartin hehe thank you :-) have a great weekend too x
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-08 11:52:19	Cutting my own fringe. Major fail!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-08 12:01:30	Decided to take myself back to bed and will start this day over again in an hour. Naps are the best.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-08 14:06:25	On a muddy walk and wading through puddles #spring http://t.co/9khQAfqWUy
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-07 15:04:29	I've just nodded off at my desk. No-one around to witness it thankfully! Week almost over...one hour and 11 mins to go.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-09 18:23:55	Going slowly crazy at home so decided to brave a run... This is perhaps not my finest anti stress plan but worth a try.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-09 19:08:27	3 mile run done. Woop!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-09 21:43:11	Cheese on toast with mayonnaise. A new taste sensation.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-07 11:09:40	So tired today I feel like I'm wading through quicksand.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-07 11:11:11	I love this! "What did you say?" Gollum.. Orlando Bloom "They're taking the Hobbits to Isengard" Live: http://t.co/p2d88QMDo3 via @YouTube

702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-14 19:00:09	Put my music to play on shuffle for the first time. It's quite weird how I feel so unsettled by this!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-14 21:09:24	Time for a new sudoki puzzle. What's happened to me??!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-12 17:48:24	Currently feeling so hectic that I've mainly been communicating in non sensical gibberish. Pretty flowers on way home to soothe me.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-12 17:49:21	Flowers :-) http://t.co/p9f63sRKtZ
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-17 17:46:51	Deadline successfully met. Now to lie down with a cold compress on my head!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-17 17:53:33	Just fallen into a prickly bus as too busy texting to watch my feet. Ouch!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-17 18:52:04	@Katrina_1503 Hehe a good description of the 192! Tripped over a flower bed instead... :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-19 16:41:45	Emergency mint aero. I'd forgotten just how tasty they are!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-18 17:35:02	How the wind howls. It's howling with wolf voices... Time to get watching lotr again.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-19 08:29:37	Lego party! http://t.co/Qa55YCDSe5
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-20 12:40:51	Time to get healthy for running. Sadly this means a complete diet overhaul as well as exercise. Farewell pints and man sized portions...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-20 17:14:26	Happy day! Spring Equinox: When does spring start? http://t.co/qq1whXuq4a
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-21 17:43:21	I have to get gin for a recipe... a slosh for the pot and a splash for me. I like cooking!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-20 21:10:21	Curled up warm in bed listening to the rain. Happy times.

702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-22 16:37:16	Poirot... The camera keeps tipping from left to right to left symbolising a ship at sea. It's confusing my inner ear somewhat!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-24 19:55:26	Missed my bus home now ages to wait. I entered into spring coat territory far too soon!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-24 20:02:16	Food food food... Must not get anything takeaway related. Must not break!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-23 17:15:37	A little overexcited that these sweets are still made! http://t.co/2e8EfcJ8hF
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-24 21:37:51	Today I walked 5627 steps. Didn't reach my 10,000 daily goal. Silly goal!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-25 08:32:08	The wrong weather day to wear grey trousers and flats outside... Soggy!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-25 16:19:10	Flat hunting is definitely improving my knowledge of areas surrounding Manchester... So many to chose from.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-26 12:06:09	Amazing hailstorm!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-26 21:29:30	Hall and Oates... Brilliant!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-26 08:36:42	What an absolute stunner of a morning! The sort of weather to be out walking in the countryside.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-26 11:00:49	Just pay your fare properly and leave us all in peace you bloody idiot! Hate buses today, silly amounts of drama.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-29 20:19:27	Enjoying a new book (Dance Dance Dance by Haruki Murakami) after a very relaxing day.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-29 09:34:33	Frasier and a cup of tea in bed. So this is what weekends are for.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-30 08:31:40	What is the real time??! Both my clocks appear to have reset themselves.... I think.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-27 21:17:59	Mr Bingley is attempting to destroy any items left unattended on his travels around my room... Hamsters have little paws and sharp teeth!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-28 09:56:50	Currently suffering all kinds of Kate Bush ticket envy! Along with a shed load of other people...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-28 13:42:19	People watching can be fascinating yet repulsive. I want to be a hermit!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-31 12:59:42	More meetings... all the meetings!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-03-31 15:59:24	Overheard idiot of the day. "So buses are like you know a student necessity to save money and all but soon I'll able to afford taxis."
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-01 07:58:36	Most amount achieved ever this morning despite only waking an hour ago. Now to work... Boo!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-01 18:49:22	@Zoe_H_F woop for BBQing. Have fun :)

702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-02 11:06:39	Deadline day. Obviously my brain is all over the place refusing to focus and I seem to have developed a fascination with chocolate...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-01 16:43:41	Wow, it's hot outside!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-03 17:07:05	Two alleged grown ups watching the five year old build a galaxy squad with Lego. Quite cross we're not allowed to join in the construction!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-02 07:31:05	Cough, cough, silly cough...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-03 17:42:23	Licked to death by the dog. Yuck!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-05 07:04:10	Unexpected compliments make me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Happy weekend mood engaged.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-03 20:45:00	I'm watching It'll Be Alright on the Night. Laughing like a hyena and coughing intermittently . . . Silly asthma.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-03 20:57:43	I knew it! Contestants on Come Dine With Me do get battered and have trouble speaking to score...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-05 17:18:28	New hair makes me so happy. Whoosh swish in every reflective surface...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-05 20:22:31	This weekend has been calm and restorative. Sleepy eyes now, and thus to bed.

702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-08 05:29:21	Surprised at how chatty randoms can be at silly o'clock in the morning. Can't they see I'm attempting upright sleeping.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-08 06:13:30	On the train to London. The sky is magnificent, looking forward to some countryside watching.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-06 07:18:14	The best Lego ever! http://t.co/8HwcGgiuON

702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-06 07:58:08	@bex_spence sadly I'm trying to steal his glory. I get to look at it in awe!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-09 08:08:41	My overnight packing skills are rubbish. Today my contact lenses case is missing from my bag and there are two sat at home. Pah!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-06 13:33:26	Just run a marathon. What do you do? Why light up. Of course!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-07 15:42:33	"Squat, thrust, kick. Squat, thrust, kick. Max it up!" Frankly insane exercise instructions echoing down the work corridor...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-06 18:22:20	I shouldn't be allowed to text when feeling effusive. It seldom leads to short sentences...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-09 13:09:07	Sleepy today with eyes so heavy and limbs like lead. Coffee time!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-09 15:24:18	YAYYYYY! MPhil has been formally completed... phew!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-12 16:58:03	Horizontal drizzle and grey skies. The most depressing of all the weather types.

702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-13 07:16:34	Woken up earlier by a coughing child inches from my face. Now he's bringing me toys to cuddle?! Sigh!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-13 07:24:26	Now he's showing me pictures of his friends on the iPhone. Frankly amazed- he knows more phone functions than I do.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-13 13:50:26	Slow time but ran 5k without stopping or foot pain. Chuffed! Now to physio stretching.

702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-14 18:52:33	I have just asked a question and not engaged my brain. "Is Toy Story 3 the third film?" Doh!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-11 16:32:45	I am outside sans coat. Feels great not being trapped in my massive winter coat.

702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-17 16:51:33	What a horribly grey day. There is a haze of drizzle surrounding this bus.

702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-20 15:50:49	I've spent the day simply messing about in boats. I agree with Water Rat that there is nothing half so much worth doing as this.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-19 10:33:18	About to embark on a 5 mile run. I have warned my Granny I may be some time.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-19 11:15:03	Well that was a training run error. Managed a very slow 3 miles before admitting defeat in the midday sun!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-19 12:33:17	Off to mend a fence with my uncle. Now that's what I call farming!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-19 17:29:20	So you have to take down the old barbed wire fence before erecting a new one. But helped my relatives deliver a lamb. Amazing experience!!

702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-20 07:39:06	Chocolate hangover!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-20 08:31:48	Three more lambs. Off to tag them this fine morning. Bit of a culture shock to me!

702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-25 07:49:19	I'm feeling the urge to hibernate again. Like a bear. Yet looking forward to York this weekend.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-26 16:12:26	Waiting to give my mum a lift home from work. My car makes a good people watching vantage point. Like a hide!

702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-25 15:19:53	Weekend times are here again.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-25 19:49:57	My mum has just offered me a chilled glass of Prosecco. Unfortunately I can't say it without sounding like a shady Sean Connery...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-23 15:30:28	Back to Manchester... Phew what a holiday!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-24 07:51:10	My back to work grump has eased off somewhat. Realising it's already Thursday and not Monday morning helped.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-27 09:25:48	@AnnaKWhitehead that sounds like a lovely day indeed!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-27 09:27:45	My mum is still asleep. Impressive considering the Minster bells have been booming away!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-28 15:38:06	Waiting for the bus feeling all hot and muggy. I knew I should've bought beer.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-27 20:37:11	After 12 nights away from my bed it's so nice to be back! Mr Bingley appears almost pleased to see me as he consented to a cuddle.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-28 17:43:30	Actually going on a real night out. Very happy about this. Rum!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-29 14:13:13	School of Language were brilliant last night! Need to get myself to more gigs this year.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-30 12:38:40	Half marathon entered for July! It wouldn't be a normal Wednesday without feelings of churning dread.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-01 10:47:26	Listening to an adaptation of Brave New World. I've decided this may not be the best listen prior to a fun celebratory lunch at Christies.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-30 18:36:55	@bex_spence the best way to spend time off work!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-30 18:51:33	Doctors tomorrow which means a lie in until at least 8.30am, so lucky. My teenage self would be horrified beyond belief at this thought!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-30 20:12:20	Excited about going to see Much Ado tomorrow. Can't wait! @rxtheatre
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-01 21:47:40	Spent the evening completely immersed in Much Ado About Nothing. What an amazing production!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-01 22:13:13	Since I am standing forlornly in the kitchen missing my bedtime piece of cheese not having a fridge will prove to be good for my waistline!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-29 07:38:05	Exploding sparkling water bottle all over my desktop, myself and even behind my glasses. Officially awake now.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-04-29 20:10:34	On a fact finding mission I like this... RT Nature Studies by Michael McCarthy: The delights of the vibrant harebell http://t.co/pm65Blp2yF
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-02 06:37:53	The dog fed my hamster some meat chews. So said the child very solemnly! Managed in time to salvage chews from Mr Bingley. Silly dog?!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-02 15:09:18	Happy mood. Thank goodness for bank holiday weekends!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-02 15:12:35	Although wearing heels for the first time in ages wasn't the best move for a busy rushing around day.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-02 15:51:03	How can the pub be shut? Sitting on the steps outside waiting for opening time. I only want a lime soda!!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-01 07:41:44	Just woken up absolutely boiling and worrying about a temperature before I realised the heating is on full pelt. Happy 1st May!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-01 09:04:26	It's now official from the the docs. I must get healthier. Farewell vending machine, my light in dark places!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-02 21:34:33	Made it home finally. Now having cauliflower cheese...on toast. I love my mum but she doesn't understand low carbs.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-02 22:22:09	Now to sleeping in a single bed. Clinging on perilously close to the edge all night.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-05 16:06:30	Just found the recent Specsaver advert with the cat/hat absolutely hilarious! Think my synapses are misfiring a little.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-03 20:22:31	Sat around a fire, drinking fizz and listening to people discuss drinking related injuries. The best night ever!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-04 16:53:17	I like this 'being the driver' thing as thoroughly spoilt. Chilling in front of a roaring fire as activity goes on in the kitchen.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-04 07:46:59	I get my grumpy morning genes from my mother.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-06 20:38:49	Full of tasty food after another lovely night of good cheer. Plus new books to read! x @lizuardo1 @thegirlkaty
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-06 15:42:07	To run or not to run... that is the question.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-06 15:57:30	With no inhaler packed I'd better not. Will look at cool running kit instead to motivate.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-06 16:55:33	Voluntarily done some basic weight training. Operation Get Fit has kicked off.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-09 07:36:48	Today I feel like absconding and going on an adventure!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-09 07:39:12	@thegirlkaty @lizuardo1 half successful is a decent attempt. Delia has good instructions, far better than the Jasper wibble test. X
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-09 12:29:56	I didn't think it was possible to overdose on feta but I've somehow managed it today.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-07 08:01:40	@thegirlkaty @lizuardo1 Hehe! I nibble on a bit last night but managed to save enough for lunch today :-) x
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-08 15:20:14	I can't squelch through anymore puddles in my leaking shoes. Time to go shopping!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-08 20:34:34	Quality sofa time happening. Deep joy.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-08 20:51:43	Oh no, chuckling away again at the adverts. Time for bed!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-07 19:28:10	I'm really loving Frost at the moment. However it's a little racier than Poirot!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-10 12:27:14	@squilbee Yep, the best portion sizes ever!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-12 14:56:57	Preponderance... what a great word!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-13 07:42:20	However Pet Shop Boys are playing on my phone so all is well again.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-10 17:26:21	@skel42 Yay! This looks damp yet awesome! x
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-10 17:30:53	Happy day visiting @levymarket and now drinking a nice glass of red in good company.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-12 07:54:35	Why do I find the thought of moving house so unsettling! Flat hunting before work on a Monday morning perhaps wasn't the cleverest idea.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-13 07:41:40	Massive sleep experiment fail! Went to bed at 9pm hoping to naturally wake up early and at 8am I finally surface... Silly tiredness.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-11 13:18:43	In my first car wash with Pegasus. Sadly I'm a little overexcited!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-14 21:05:22	Delicately balancing a hamster cage on one arm and manoeuvring down the death staircase was harder than usual tonight. Silly wine!

702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-16 16:21:04	I have the tightest turnaround time ever to pack, clean everything... Note to self... Do not forget to feed Mr Bingley!!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-16 07:58:59	The busiest day ahead and still haven't packed! I desperately need a holiday but at least it's Friday. Yay for weekends!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-16 09:58:26	Finally waking up thanks to a great cup of tea. A walk in the sunshine this lunch is also hopefully on the cards.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-15 14:05:27	What an amazing cat!! BBC News - Tara the cat rescues boy from attack by dog http://t.co/JK7btnk2jG
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-18 18:11:59	Cheeky blackbirds singing, fat wood pigeons cooing and the pop of Prosecco bottles. Quintessential English soundtrack.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-15 20:54:26	Bed is just about my favourite place in the whole world. I will tidy and pack tomorrow morning instead... Honestly.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-21 17:40:07	Someone is smoking a pipe in this beer garden. It reminds me vividly of my granddaddy. I do like how smells can access a nice memory!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-20 21:14:59	Thanks to lovely people for a great night @thegirlkaty @lizuardo1 the balloon/badge combo made it safely home :-) x http://t.co/2G90gEdCaP

702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-26 12:05:10	@skel42 I love this photo! :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-26 12:03:45	A day off doing nothing much at all. This feels amazing if slightly surreal.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-26 18:45:50	True Detective... What an amazing series!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-26 20:20:41	Attractive sunset in Levenshulme tonight. http://t.co/IaaU3uHCDU
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-29 07:40:02	Operation let natural light wake me rather than alarms was an abject fail.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-29 07:43:23	However payday and a tasty lunch out today. Thank god for payday!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-28 13:03:05	This made me laugh despite a looming 4 mile jog/run later. I am a jogger, not a runner – and so are you - http://t.co/yS71CpeVsB
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-28 13:12:51	Cheesy chips. Simultaneously the greatest food ever and the most soporific...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-27 11:22:38	Early morning dental appointment and now have some retainers to wear overnight. Despite them being plastic I feel a little like Jaws...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-28 16:32:22	Pub pub pub... That's all my brain is thinking today.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-29 16:13:57	Really loving this today! http://t.co/bddUlSypOn via @youtube
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-27 18:28:25	I've just made the bed with a new duvet set and am immensely happy. I've turned into someone my teenage self would've loathed!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-27 21:01:04	Farewell coffee, tea, red wine, curry, and berries for the next month. So says my tooth whitening dentist. Deep woe!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-27 21:09:20	Housemate offered me a glass of Argentinian Malbec. . . Hence the first world problem strop.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-28 19:04:14	@bex_spence hehe, indeed! :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-28 19:04:32	@susielizmartin yes, I reckon so! ;-)
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-27 19:15:25	@skel42 Sadly no. However, from this moment onwards it will be the only way I make beds! :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-29 18:33:43	The secret to a reasonably fast 4 mile run. Amazing dim sum this lunchtime :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2014-05-29 18:37:53	Straight after posting about ALL the Dim Sum I can hear Little Miss Greedy being read as a bedtime story. . .

702724255	rarajasper	2014-06-02 20:59:37	The final to this series of Revenge has been pretty darn gripping! #seriously
702724255	rarajasper	2014-06-03 06:12:53	Last focus group today for a long time. Take that nerves. Now where is my suit?

702724255	rarajasper	2014-06-06 20:03:40	Cleaning my room. I can see my floor but sadly my bed is totally covered in stuff! How will I sleep??!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-06-06 21:33:27	@rarajasper the floor is still looking a distinct possibility!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-06-09 20:19:27	Cosmetic dentistry take two tomorrow morning. Not sure all the Malbec this weekend was the wisest move... yet darn tasty!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-06-12 15:45:29	Sat on a bus that has all the heating on. May actually melt to death!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-06-12 18:26:32	Leaving town and never known the bus to be so empty. God bless the foottheball!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-06-12 18:30:23	Great catch up with the girls, rarebit and cocktails :-) @thegirlkaty @lizuardo1 and saw this for the first time! http://t.co/Z604igt3p0

702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-04 10:39:25	Relaxing day... Bliss! http://t.co/0YwKX3oqb5
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-03 11:07:39	False eyelash horrors have been removed. No longer look like I have spiders legs attached to my eyes.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-04 16:00:37	Since the rain is only horizontal and not sideways I've decided to go for an evening walk. All I can hear is plastic swishing.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-04 16:27:12	My relatives have left for the weekend and I'm now in sole charge of Granny and 53 lambs... All the lambs! http://t.co/njXFnAmPC4
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-05 19:26:42	Granny has just asked me if I have any aunts and uncles?! Confusion central as I tried to explain.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-05 19:29:46	Spring cleaning and this bird got slightly confused when flying into the house eaves. Managed a success rescue :) http://t.co/aA2pUWM2nr
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-05 19:52:03	Panicking that I'd lost the lambs but they're hiding further down the field. Stunning light here in Scotland! http://t.co/MnqpGRoBiU
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-05 09:04:20	My domestic day has been temporarily derailed due to a sudden attack of sleepyhead still in beditis.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-07 16:51:27	Running ahead of schedule. Tasks all done for today. Think this calls for a swift half!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-03 20:33:29	Where is my tummy rub?! Happy to be sharing a room with this one. http://t.co/5jeESBFySC
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-03 22:53:35	It's so quiet and dark. Despite knowing this should be peaceful I can't sleep. At all! Time for the light on and headphones in...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-06 19:59:23	In bed already. It is sunny outside so this feels very wrong and yet so nice!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-04 01:26:53	Creak creak creak! Old houses make some funny noises.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-08 07:21:31	Gown and tickets collected for graduation. Now on bus home to make myself look less scruffy. Soon a relaxing weekend!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-09 18:50:26	Saw beautiful blue flowers on way home. Now in bed with a hot water bottle, chocolate and a nice book. Happy times. http://t.co/LP3RVddmom
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-09 19:17:53	How can it only be Wednesday?
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-10 05:54:34	Nothing says morning more than the sound of the kid terrorising your hamster with marbles. Successful hamster rescue achieved.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-11 12:31:25	Chosen an absolutely gorgeous day to go and sit in the dark at the theater. Nice lunchtime stroll around Whitworth Park though.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-11 12:37:34	Falling asleep at my desk. This does not bode well for the three hour conceptualising meeting this afternoon...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-11 21:27:06	If the person you are talking to doesn't appear to be listening, be patient. It may simply be that he has a small piece of fluff in his ear.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-10 16:56:40	@j_bengo how nice if repetitive. In summer we get confused bumblebees that bang into the windows. Loudly and repeatedly!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-10 18:51:30	Despite nearly tripping over a street full of cats I really enjoyed my run today! #couch25k http://t.co/M8U0lXPnL1
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-10 19:06:44	@yourmotionsays They're everywhere! Must be basking on the Tarmac.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-12 13:13:18	Bees, birds, blue skies, book reading on a balcony. The best weekend.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-12 13:44:51	Clearly a bit sun drunk there and have jinxed the weather. Go away clouds!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-13 07:31:05	Watching Batman and eating buttered Brioche. A loud but pleasant Sunday morning.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-10 21:19:10	What a lovely evening reading until the light went.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-13 13:10:35	Babysitting ended. Now what to do with my afternoon... Wine? Or cleaning?
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-15 07:48:37	Lllllaaattteeee! Had to run for the bus. Oops!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-15 14:03:42	Today has been a day of rushing around, scrambling and playing catch up! Looking forward to a run and relax later.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-15 16:45:54	Hurry up bus. No time to run. No time to bathe. Hate public transport. Grr grr!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-15 17:38:31	@bex_spence Yes indeed. It's not been the most punctual day!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-17 11:24:15	Apparently we've been making so much progress this morning that our meeting has been extended all afternoon... Noooooooo!!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-17 15:58:31	Two and a half weeks off the cycle of preliminary planning meeting, the main meeting and then a debrief catch up meeting. . . Joy!

702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-18 15:35:58	My phone appears to be broken. I am actually gutted. Need to get a grip!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-19 07:30:53	Nothing says restful morning more than racing to the bathroom before the five year old takes another never-ending bath.

702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-23 20:00:22	Happy dog and hamster. Almost clean house. That'll do pig, that'll do.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-25 14:52:58	Weekend times :-) woop!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-25 22:25:44	I suppose Friday night isn't the time to complain about music and shouting from neighbours but wish they'd shut up already.

702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-27 20:40:20	Beautiful people in plush locations. Watching The Tourist and thoroughly enjoying the silliness.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-27 10:08:43	There is quite a queue forming outside Tesco. A motley selection of folk - clearly desperate for baked goods!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-27 18:25:20	A three hour snooze?! Don't mind if I do...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-28 15:50:24	Failing at logistic planning! Not enough time in any one day! I need a time machine to teleport me directly on holiday...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-30 07:59:29	So incredibly sleepy today it feels like I'm attempting to wade through quicksand.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-07-30 20:07:19	The Devil Wears Prada is on ... Yay!

702724255	rarajasper	2014-08-05 16:47:16	Running is amazing! As is being able to breathe. Inhalers do work wonders!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-08-06 16:04:44	Longest day ever...officially having a dislike my work day! Must do pilates tonight instead of attacking the Rose wine.

702724255	rarajasper	2014-08-10 09:00:36	Despite being told by numerous people I'm still taken aback by the weather. The dog flatly refused a walk. A good snoozing and reading day!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-08-11 15:19:54	My boss just asked me why my trousers are two tone in colour? Bus. Massive puddle. Total drenching!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-08-13 09:12:35	I'm not very good at resting in bed.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-08-13 12:56:52	In exactly one week I will be all moved into my new flat. Must rein in frustration for only a little longer...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-08-13 13:09:42	@skel42 Ha, me too. Now I just seem to worry. Time to put on some trash tv!

702724255	rarajasper	2014-08-15 20:04:54	The dog is trying to sneak under my duvet and onto the sofa. Any minute now this will cease to be funny and I'll end up flat on the floor!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-08-18 21:32:04	Trying to sleep without my memory foam mattress topper. How spoilt and soft I've become!

702724255	rarajasper	2014-09-23 17:31:44	Spent my entire life trying not to get stuck into an evening rut of routine hideousness. No wonder I feel chaotic! Time to change.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-09-26 00:18:51	Waking up to loud foxes again. What a noise but love the nature on my doorstep.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-09-27 19:02:35	Kate Bush was incredible live last night. The best gig ever!!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-09-24 14:15:02	I found a pound coin on the floor. Insanely happy now.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-09-26 10:19:01	Listening to New Order All The Way. Cracking tunes whilst rain gazing.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-09-28 14:36:05	I don't want to go back to Manchester. Weeps! Beats brow! Oh look, free wine and snack box... Happy days.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-09-24 19:45:53	Big sneeze man upstairs is at it again. May cough loudly at the ceiling in retaliation. Is this how neighbour wars start?!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-09-28 20:23:19	Matthew McConaughey has amazing arms!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-09-29 19:40:44	I have bought a large amount of clothes. Happy post shopping collapse then an early night.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-02 21:10:37	A London marathon place. Better not do a 'Rimmer' and perfect a revision/training plan to the detriment of actual running. #reddwarf
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-06 19:43:15	People on Grand Designs are extremely dedicated. Or obsessive?! House envy.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-06 07:40:45	Obligatory rain tweet. Absolutely soaked!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-06 12:41:24	Smoked mackeral salad! So far the healthy eating is going to plan. #2mealsinsixmonths
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-08 18:46:44	I am enjoying Pierce Brosnan as Bond on the wet and windy evening. Cheese overload yet fun.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-08 19:04:39	Bond "Like a shadow operation? M "Remember. Shadows stay in front or behind. Never on top." M giving Bond some sage dating advice there!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-08 21:05:58	New Crackanory....brilliant!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-09 07:46:45	I fear I may have caught a nasty chill getting soaked yesterday. Horrible cold and sore throat season!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-09 07:47:26	However the leaves are looking beautiful around my new flat and the squirrels are hard at work finding nuts :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-09 16:11:13	The sudden heartbreaking realisation that I have no masher! Sausage and mash denied!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-09 19:07:15	Just watched Obsessive Compulsive Cleaners and now Don't Tell The Bride. What has happened to me?! Oh yes, still poorly!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-09 19:23:19	Why is the wedding dress the most important thing? Don't people know there are Lord of The Ring tours to go on in New Zealand!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-09 19:24:04	@ingridboring hehe, they are amusing shows!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-12 17:46:54	Watching In Her Shoes. Great film!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-13 11:30:55	Why are gardeners tidying up the grounds of my flat with motorised vehicles? Don't they know I'm sick? Self pitying thought of the day...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-14 08:17:15	Up again all night with fevered dreams. Feeling normal would be much appreciated now body!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-18 20:10:42	Watching Midsummer Murders?! This endless cold is turning me into a rubbish TV addict.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-19 22:25:56	I seem to have gone to bed early and tired yet am still holding my phone. Time to sleep away from my beloved mobile...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-19 17:55:30	@rarajasper Good plan! Must get some new wool- quick before it happens again :)
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-21 18:11:49	So weather has been entertaining/concerning me today. Now on a bus with another one to go. Feet like ice! Dull weather chat over...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-21 18:32:22	Second bus. Deep joy. Why oh why didn't I drive...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-22 15:37:36	FOOOOOOD??! The winter hungers have arrived.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-22 16:07:40	I have an untouched apple and a sad looking orange on my desk. Clearly not that hungry!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-20 17:31:11	Well that was a day and a half! Time for pjs and sofa sitting.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-23 15:04:50	I am excited at the thought of a night of laundry and cleaning. This can't be a normal feeling?
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-23 18:45:17	I'm thoroughly enjoying Monty Don teaching people how to garden. Love the moss tip. #BigDreamsSmallSpaces
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-24 21:12:13	What is the most interesting thing you can do with a sausage? #QI
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-26 09:35:22	Good morning biting wind. I'm going to have to dig out my winter jacket soon.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-26 14:34:37	Today was the wrong day to wear no socks! What was I thinking?!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-25 20:54:56	Office Space. Quality film!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-28 11:43:15	Choke badly on an orange. Blame the fruit. Open a mini chocolate bar. Cue more coughing and spluttering. No more eating today!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-27 18:16:58	Three mile run done with a semi sprint finish. Very chuffed. Could these be the mythical Endorphins?!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-27 20:48:53	I've never seen one hamster cram so much into its pouches. Sadly Bingley refused to be photographed. Amusement of the evening!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-28 20:15:41	My dedication to watching a girly film is ridiculous. The screen keeps flickering and failing yet I WILL keep watching!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-28 21:06:12	Now time for Cockneys Vs Zombies. . .
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-29 08:44:40	Not much is better than a decent mixed cd present and a crisp sunny morning.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-02 00:42:54	Seem to be wired and shaking. Four cups of coffee as designated driver was perhaps an error.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-02 01:38:59	Interesting book selection this Weymouth flat has! Particularly like that this weighty Churchill tome is part five.. http://t.co/irHXtVzYQC
702724255	rarajasper	2014-10-31 19:27:25	Weymouth times. Fish and chips plus beer! Win.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-02 09:35:55	I have post dancing in heels at wedding legs. Great fun although my calves are on fire!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-05 17:37:19	Why do I never dress appropriately for the weather. Brrrrr! Scotland tomorrow. Where are my fleeces?
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-07 11:45:49	This was Rocky's face just before he jumped into my bed with muddy feet! http://t.co/MOjpM3dRGV
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-07 19:26:02	Lasagna, garlic bread, salad and red wine. Win!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-06 20:57:04	Yawning myself into an early bed. Love the peace and calm of Scotland.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-12 21:13:35	@bex_spence I like this a lot!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-12 21:16:25	@bex_spence @truffleshuffle_ yes, it's for him. Next weekend! Great, will check this out. Thanks :)
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-12 09:27:12	What in the world shall I buy for a 30th birthday present? I've trawled online and may actually have to brave town this weekend... wah!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-16 12:04:48	Slept in like a log. How dare you body! I didn't even drink last night?!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-16 16:49:16	I've been awake five hours and already contemplating my bed. Ah bed!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-16 18:34:24	Forgotten how much I love the tv series of Pride and Prejudice. Comfort viewing.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-23 22:02:33	I'm watching Meet the Romans and already enjoying it.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-24 20:19:30	Hurry along now food. Cook already!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-25 11:49:23	There must be an optimum temperature for perfectly drinkable tea. So far today I've had scolding, lukewarm and stone cold.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-28 08:23:47	Worrying a lot about my approaching MOT. I love my car but they cost an arm and a leg to maintain!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-29 20:04:42	@ingridboring Aww how sweet. Thank you!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-30 19:23:16	There is no cheese in the flat. This makes me sad!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-11-29 16:51:43	I have new hair and now am going out for drinks. Shame my body thinks it's bedtime!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-01 17:03:29	Even in my post MOT gloom I love this clip... Robin Hood - Call Off Christmas: http://t.co/FautvYIc14 via @YouTube
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-02 21:05:08	Great programme! #secretsofthecastle
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-02 19:37:21	One of the good things about getting trapped by lights across a junction is the angry people can't see you. Why can't I drive normally!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-05 08:41:43	Just walked past an empty burning car. The fire engine turned up quickly and put it out. Impressive stuff!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-05 21:26:35	Dark haunted houses with spider webs. This Jonathan Creek episode is actually scaring me!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-06 19:49:03	Watching the extended version of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. My god it's good so far!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-07 11:03:48	I need to start checking the weather forecast after a morning run in incredibly icy rain. Brr!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-07 13:58:38	Primark. What fresh hell is this?!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-08 22:04:18	I can't get warm tonight. Probably because I've eaten my own bodyweight in pizza.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-09 22:12:18	I've just swallowed a fruit fly with a slurp of orange juice. Cue all the shudders and coughing!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-10 16:33:50	Based on the traffic into town it looks highly unlikely my run can happen tonight. I need a time and teleportation  machine, or a rum!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-11 08:45:28	I'm suddenly experiencing an enormous amount of Joie de vivre... unusual but a welcome feeling.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-12 20:22:05	I'm watching Don't Tell the Bride and eating bacon, tomato and peanut butter sandwiches. The greatest night :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-13 15:58:34	Finally completed a shockingly hard 8 mile run :-) Despite frozen puddles and black ice. . . By sheer luck I managed to avoid a slip!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-13 16:46:15	Ginger nuts and mint hot chocolate go together amazingly. Suddenly the world is a jollier place.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-16 13:06:50	I'm sipping a lunchtime cup of tea in the student union bar. Oh how times have changed!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-16 20:50:15	Snoozing on the sofa and just realised #BlackMirror White Christmas is on in 10 minutes. Must. Wake. Up.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-16 17:42:39	A random girl has just vomited copiously into my hastily offered plastic bag. I have the worst public transport luck.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-15 08:35:16	This year I've asked for a swanky new light emitting alarm clock. I'm not planning on using it until the 5th January 2015! #liein
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-17 09:06:09	@squilbee it was good. Brilliant cast!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-17 18:34:37	Feeling lonesome and decidedly footsore after an hour long walk home in heels and drizzle. Time for a hot chocolate and sofa time.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-18 19:14:51	I've broken into my emergency pasta. Need pasta!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-19 06:37:50	Wide awake, wracked by post nightmare angst.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-17 22:05:41	I have swapped sofa for bed. It took many many attempts...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-19 16:34:55	These are super sweet! FRIDAY..... woop! Snow babies – cutest animals in the snow – in pictures http://t.co/fv3vYyNAHL
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-19 19:10:50	I suddenly have a craving to watch Moulin Rouge... "someday I'll fly away, leave all this to yesterday..." Wish I could hibernate!
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-22 16:44:35	The Christmas excitement has started... directly correlated with getting my shit together?! How annoying.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-23 09:53:31	Late late late. Last day of work and I'm so late! Hurry along bus. . .
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-23 22:38:22	Little shop, little shop of horrors. Little shop, little shop of horrors...
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-25 15:54:19	Eating cheese and crackers, drinking cava and watching Fellowship of the Ring with my mum. Happy times.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-28 09:29:20	What a beautiful frosty morning in York. Lots of birds singing away up high and teasing the local cat. http://t.co/VC3eYuyQKm
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-28 18:26:05	I'm very confused by what date and even day it is... Will go back to burying myself in cauliflower cheese.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-28 22:54:58	Black ice tomorrow, especially over high ground in the north. Starting to dread the drive back to Manchester already.
702724255	rarajasper	2014-12-29 18:42:09	I'm finally back to my flat, drinking cava and watching The Witches. Unpacking can start tomorrow!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-05 19:36:45	Wow. Don't Tell the Bride is amusing me rather too much. Hurry along Revenge!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-05 21:46:15	I seem to have eaten jelly babies and slices of cheese for tea? Oops...
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-08 10:14:36	Why can't I hibernate through winter? Bit of a tough week mentally. I plan to recreate Christmas on Sunday by cooking a roast chicken.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-08 10:16:03	@bex_spence It was one of the elusive endings I missed! Thanks :)
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-08 11:40:46	I'm editing a paper I'm leading on and seem to have written whole reams of gobbledegook. Crap!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-08 22:23:35	@ingridboring Impressive stuff! :)
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-08 22:27:52	@ingridboring Going ok thanks but trying to get motivated when tired is tough. Can't wait for lighter days!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-10 06:55:36	Wow weather. All the weather!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-10 20:13:41	I'm watching Sense and Sensibility with some spectacular scenes of social awkwardness. Brilliant film!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-11 10:02:56	William Shatner is in Columbo. My morning is complete.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-13 19:15:21	Loud sneeze stomp man upstairs now has a cold. Rescue me... someone!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-16 09:15:13	@susielizmartin Hehe. It was very tasty. Almost the weekend! x
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-16 09:38:28	Ready for the RSPB's Big Garden #Birdwatch? Sign up and take part in the biggest wildlife survey in the world. http://t.co/T5s5h0mW3Q
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-15 21:03:59	Can't watch Ghost now. Time for bed instead and a baileys hot chocolate!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-19 21:18:14	Bed! Happy finally.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-19 19:28:46	Today has been the longest day. Tomorrow will be even longer. Then it's almost the weekend and my marathon training can continue. Zzzz!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-18 21:47:27	So tomorrow looks like it might be happening soon ... Delaying sleep as long as possible!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-21 20:30:22	@Saims Aww thanks :-) x
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-21 20:35:34	@thatlittlekatie @Saims hope the lunch helped. Next week indeed! x
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-21 20:43:36	Damn fine series plus Martin stumbling through an icy river. All compulsive viewing! #winterwatch
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-22 17:43:05	Why has the bus stopped?! Gah! I spend too much of my life with that 'late, late to a very important date' sick feeling.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-26 22:27:59	A lovely evening catching up with friends but now it's silly bedtime. Already!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-28 09:05:29	Absolutely dire weather outside. Come back sunshine. I need the mood boost.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-28 12:35:42	The sun is out. My mood has noticeably lifted :)
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-28 19:40:46	@skel42 Aww, thanks x
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-28 18:36:25	I've really appreciated time walking/driving in the hills this month. Helps with the anxiety and stresses of life. http://t.co/DBkuyGlv9Z
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-28 21:00:16	@JimboAndo @yourmotionsays Yes, love it! :)
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-31 08:43:02	Woke this morning to find the heating on overnight and my flat like a sauna. Balls!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-30 15:07:22	A clear work email inbox. For the first time this year :-)
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-29 07:52:46	In my snow travel panic I seem to have arrived at the train station 45 minutes early. Plus there is no snow yet!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-29 08:31:50	There is snow! A little too excitedly pointed this out to my train table neighbour! He didn't look pleased?!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-29 08:46:25	@Saims Take care x
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-29 09:41:22	@Saims Thank you. Cold!! Hehe, you should be allowed. Feel like that too ;) x
702724255	rarajasper	2015-01-30 21:33:35	Finding Miss Marple very intriguing and my sofa the best place in the world. What has become of me?!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-02-02 20:57:52	It turns out I've bought some flat pack side tables that need a drill to assemble.  Hate hate hate DIY!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-02-01 21:49:14	So excited as my mum is coming next weekend for an impromptu visit. Now to find exhibitions and stuff to entertain her.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-02-02 21:55:16	Watching Mr Bingley rearrange his new fresh bedding and eating makes me feel all warm inside. Good old hamster.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-02-03 08:11:15	What a kind bus driver. He waits for folk to run up to the closed doors and actually lets then on.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-02-03 08:17:18	Quite excited about my night in Bristol. Looking forward to exploring my old childhood haunts.

702724255	rarajasper	2015-02-10 15:51:01	I'm reading a literature review and my brain is melting. One sentence lasted six lines!

702724255	rarajasper	2015-02-10 18:05:23	When collecting a small child do check the name of the school. Baffling array of primary schools right next to each other. Your honour!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-02-11 20:13:27	I'm watching amazing Red-breasted Sapsucker birds #Alaska: Earth's Frozen Kingdom on BBC 2. Now all the salmon!

702724255	rarajasper	2015-02-22 07:26:26	Wide awake and freezing cold. Sunday morning blues.

Please stop playing everything on loop. I am so tired......!
Wish I had the guts to storm upstairs.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-12 22:18:47	I should have stayed up watching TV and cracked open the gin. Even my hamster objects to the 'party?' happening upstairs!

702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-16 13:54:11	Countryside not countrywide.... However Countrywide Watch could be a new prime time TV show.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-18 21:20:52	How can one tiny hamster be so noisy?! Mr Bingers, time to stop chewing the bars please!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-18 21:44:09	Yay, all the treats have worked in hamster calming. Time for bed. Woop!

702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-18 20:03:55	I'm watching Murder, She Wrote. The overacting gets better and better.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-19 22:12:33	I hate hiccups. With every inch of my being. Gahhhhh!!!!!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-20 08:28:12	Just watched a magpie fly straight into a bus shelter then in retaliation the crazy bird attacked the glass. Made me chuckle.

702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-22 19:08:18	I found an emergency pie in my freezer. Yay for pies.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-23 17:04:28	Lots of lovely holidays ahead to get excited about. Summer time definitely on the way.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-23 20:20:13	Despite staying with 10minutes walk from The British Museum there is sadly no time to visit this occasion. I will be back.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-23 16:53:18	This has been the wrong day to go cold turkey on the caffeine! Everyone is drinking tea around me ....
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-23 21:46:04	Beer, bath, bed. Happy times.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-23 13:57:15	In Grimsby station eating a warm bacon, brie and cranberry sauce sandwich. By far my new favourite sandwich. Wow!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-25 18:49:39	I really really want some double cream.... All whipped up. Odd brain.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-25 19:19:49	Watching Come Dine With Me when hungry not a good plan. Or is watching it making me hungry? HUNGRY!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-25 21:12:34	Bed. My younger self would have wept at this inability to function post 9pm.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-27 22:29:13	Oh crumbs, just drank the last of the Christmas Baileys. Farewell early running start.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-27 16:45:08	Finally the weekend! Doing a happy dance!

702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-28 17:18:38	I've just watched Over The Hedge. Strangely enjoyable silliness!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-28 07:36:24	No payday until Monday means no cheese on toast for breakfast. I may as well have a little snooze.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-28 22:25:04	Trying to sleep and all I can think is that I really want a dog to cuddle. Too many hours worked though... #switchoffbrain
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-28 22:30:43	All I need to do is find a local pub with a friendly dog and visit often. A plan. Now to sleep...
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-30 12:10:33	This lunchtime I will be mainly be buying some running clothes that flatter instead of making me look like a sack of potatoes #running
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-29 20:53:12	Finally there is Peace in the Valley from Elvis...
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-29 16:49:12	How have I never seen Cocoon before? Dodgy graphics aside I'm really enjoying it.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-29 18:36:40	Now I'm watching Beastly. I do like a good teen film adaptation of a fairy tale, Shakespeare play et al...
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-29 20:43:31	Again I am shattered in bed and Elvis blasting away. If only could locate the flat no it's originating from. Ear plugs!

702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-31 20:23:45	Watching Dara and Ed's Great Big Adventure on BBC2. Makes me want to unearth my dusty passport and travel!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-03-31 08:00:07	I haven't quite got this clock change malarkey down yet. LATE!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-04-03 18:32:49	Stupid asthma. Only managed 11 miles but feel dodgy so I'll take that today.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-04-03 18:34:13	Now mum wants to drink wine. I'm want to feel like drinking wine but sticking to the weak tea. #grownup
702724255	rarajasper	2015-04-03 23:48:43	My mum is still drinking wine. I have now joined her. Bye bye tomorrow. . .
702724255	rarajasper	2015-04-05 12:24:05	I have pre-party jitters. Excitement and/or nervous butterflies. The sunshine is gorgeous though.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-04-04 09:07:47	Ouch. My head hurts!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-04-04 17:23:12	I've fallen in love with my new tablet but not enjoy my wobbly broadband signal. Work wifi dammit!

702724255	rarajasper	2015-04-03 07:26:01	Today I will attempt a 20 mile run in the rain. Or I may swim it. Not sure which with this damn weather!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-04-03 08:21:26	My bed is like a black hole. Again I am in it, somehow?!

702724255	rarajasper	2015-04-09 21:10:42	@squilbee it is a fancy baseball cap. Somehow I managed to spend a small fortune in the running shop!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-04-09 15:22:58	I've decided to head into town and buy a decent running cap... behavior guaranteed to make the sun disappear.

702724255	rarajasper	2015-05-26 21:10:53	Well this is the stuff of nightmares! https://t.co/1JAbvHQgek
702724255	rarajasper	2015-05-27 16:45:44	@bex_spence Ha, it does seem much wetter over here! In my head York is always sunny x
702724255	rarajasper	2015-05-27 16:47:41	@lizuardo1 I had to do the same. Today I left my coat behind on purpose to be all summer like... :-/
702724255	rarajasper	2015-05-27 18:32:45	Watching Couples Come Dine With Me and eating sweet and salty pop corn for tea... So my pre-payday life has come to this!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-05-27 18:43:17	Rogue squirrel alert. View from my window... gave me quite a start! http://t.co/3nifFkuwuB
702724255	rarajasper	2015-05-28 18:17:27	Finally on holiday yet my boyfriend has beaten me at a pub thumb war challenge. Happy and sad all at once!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-05-27 16:38:07	Glasses covered in cold rain and soggy shoes. Way to go May, way to go!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-05-29 11:15:04	Having a full tank of diesel always makes me happy. That and holidays!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-05-30 00:20:22	Trying to read by the torchlight of my phone as suddenly super awake. Go to sleep brain - sleep is good...
702724255	rarajasper	2015-05-31 01:01:30	What an excellent day walking, eating out and great company... Plus found a Lord of the Rings water steed! http://t.co/VpuDBtvvUL
702724255	rarajasper	2015-06-07 09:02:45	Up early and off for a Sunday walk. My teenage self would have been disgusted by this wholesomeness.
702724255	rarajasper	2015-06-08 18:00:27	@bex_spence ah cool. She said she'd seen you too x
702724255	rarajasper	2015-06-08 18:07:00	Only my second run since the marathon. Feeling slightly apprehensive and definitely can't be arsed. #sofa #gin
702724255	rarajasper	2015-06-12 19:09:03	Friday night - the best night to cook a full roast dinner??! Damn you reduced price free range chicken!!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-06-13 18:09:30	I'm off to see Nearly Dan at Band on the Wall. Yay!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-06-19 12:45:50	Lovely lunch out at @ChristiesBistro Only one more afternoon left then the weekend!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-06-19 16:54:48	Over crowded bus leads to hand holding with random strangers! #awkward
702724255	rarajasper	2015-06-19 17:07:27	@skel42 Lol, that'd be even more excruciating! Disowning public transport - apart from train as booze can be drunk legitimately! :)
702724255	rarajasper	2015-06-19 17:29:50	@skel42 Haha! Definitely not!
702724255	rarajasper	2015-06-18 22:05:20	Tired all day. Wired right now. Damn you elusive sleep!
