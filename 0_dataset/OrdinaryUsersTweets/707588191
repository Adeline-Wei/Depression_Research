707588191	willbnicely	2012-07-24 04:51:10	Coming home to an empty house #kindadepressing
707588191	willbnicely	2012-07-24 16:19:13	Someone's about to get their shit ripped. Making demands of me when you have no leverage? #contemptable
707588191	willbnicely	2012-07-24 17:21:35	Noodles&amp;Co. to chill me out #delicious

707588191	willbnicely	2012-07-21 01:19:53	The feeling of leaving tomorrow...
707588191	willbnicely	2012-07-21 08:43:05	Love the good sci-fi dreams. Gotta put that shit to paper like the next Poe or Bradbury or Verne.
707588191	willbnicely	2012-07-25 14:15:20	I'ma kill'em, rape'em, then eat his fuckin' costume: Just wait!

707588191	willbnicely	2012-07-26 04:48:40	I've been thinking... actions or words? When they conflict, which do you belive? #nosleep
707588191	willbnicely	2012-07-26 06:53:47	Some things change... And some things never change #havefaith

707588191	willbnicely	2012-08-18 00:56:04	It's plain to see: My friend Ebin is a nazi #rockout
707588191	willbnicely	2012-08-16 06:39:39	What do you think of your own actions? Are you being mature like you say you are, or being stupid and naive? #dowhatyouwant
707588191	willbnicely	2012-08-16 14:09:26	Long is the way, and hard. But up through the darkness shall lead to light. #se7en

707588191	willbnicely	2012-08-24 21:20:54	You're about to get into the ditch that you opened up #brokenbells
707588191	willbnicely	2012-08-27 22:23:11	I can wear my 1970's era Cathedral singlet. I just may have to wrestle in a folkstyle tournament so I can wear it #nevergivingitup

707588191	willbnicely	2012-09-14 00:13:12	We carry the weight of our troubles forever, and still persevere and do good works. That is what it is to be Irish.
707588191	willbnicely	2012-09-12 01:01:27	Out with the bros #poolandbeers
707588191	willbnicely	2012-09-14 03:09:02	Hookah and some old school jams. Now that's how you go about #relaxing

707588191	willbnicely	2012-09-15 00:46:47	Foo Fighters and bowling... sounds like a #retronight to me
707588191	willbnicely	2012-09-15 06:49:45	Sometimes, you have to wonder what games people are playing #skeptical
707588191	willbnicely	2012-09-06 02:50:04	Totally forgot Liam Neeson is the main character's dad in Gangs of New York. This movie just got 1,000 times better

707588191	willbnicely	2012-09-17 23:52:57	@AmberBowman well, I def hope it's gone in a day or 4!
707588191	willbnicely	2012-09-18 12:46:23	I'm glad I keep a notebook handy when I sleep, or at least my phone. Getting back into writing short stories takes inspiration
707588191	willbnicely	2012-09-18 20:30:46	Hmm... What kind of facial hair to have, if any? #toughdecisions
707588191	willbnicely	2012-09-19 16:34:20	If I die today, I'm going to live on as a psycho rage-ghost of hate. #sopissed

707588191	willbnicely	2012-11-09 01:58:26	@AmberBowman but how's that even a valid reason to not be friends? I mean, who likes being surrounded by dumb people all the time?

707588191	willbnicely	2013-01-10 13:47:28	Great. One of my better (varsity) kids broke his collarbone. Just what we needed...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-01-10 17:05:15	Attempting to lucidly daydream. Hope it works!

707588191	willbnicely	2013-01-16 01:31:26	@MPittsford if I didn't think like that, I'd have given up a couple weeks ago lol
707588191	willbnicely	2013-01-16 15:18:29	I hate slow mornings. Just can't seem to wake up #backtobed
707588191	willbnicely	2013-01-16 19:04:47	Apparently, knowing someone's name doesn't make it easier to set them on fire with your mind #wishfulthinking
707588191	willbnicely	2013-01-17 22:52:08	Always looking to improve, but I'm pretty happy with where I'm at now

707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-09 01:11:35	Oh man. Already having a blast at state, and it's only the first night
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-09 01:16:29	I've also got quite the fun crew working with me #funtimes #24/7
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-10 10:32:11	Too early for being awake. Had a blast last night tho! Good times with @Bunchie9 @GiftedGinger
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-13 13:51:12	Not a bad night. Looking for more like it today http://t.co/nQeeUCOs6r
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-14 05:10:22	That is what $2,300 of success looks like @GiftedGinger http://t.co/2j8T76fZjy
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-10 21:40:24	LONG weekend, but I had a blast working with @Bunchie9 @ty0023 @GiftedGinger
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-14 13:31:10	Time to drive back to my reality. It was a fun run at least #don'twannago
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-14 16:03:47	Why must taco bell be so cold! #bullpies #minirage
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-11 19:16:40	This rain is such a downer. Why couldn't the weather from yesterday hang around a bit longer?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-15 01:40:22	1 man dance/cleaning party up in this house! #boredashell
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-15 01:49:22	Let the sky fall. When it crumbles, we will stand tall and face it all, together at Skyfall #greatsong #greatmovie
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-15 03:32:30	Bitch, I'll HM01 you!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-15 04:03:32	Up with just the thoughts of this coming weekend and another 35 hours of work in 2.5 days #atleastitpays
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-15 13:37:51	Now my mind is running circles trying to make sense of that madness #confusing #epicdreams
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-15 14:27:21	Sometimes, I worry too much about little things and not enough about the important things #truth
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-15 17:45:26	Who needs a truck to move a trailer? I got 2 hitches and all the horses I need #manlypride
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-17 14:39:52	Finding a clean bathroom at a tourney is like the quest for the golden fleece: an impossible task for an imaginary object #seriouslythough
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-16 00:19:52	It's a good thing I like driving so much #dammitall #alittlefrustrated
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-18 13:28:01	So. Much. To. Do. #maxthrottle
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-16 01:40:02	I've driven somewhere near 215,000  miles since I got my license, so in 8 years and 11 months. If only I got paid by the mile...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-16 03:30:47	Well, I was ready for bed, then I smashed most of a rockstar. Now I'm going to be fighting the urge to stay up until 3am...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-21 14:17:54	Why must it be so cold the day I'm freezing when I get out of bed? #butreally #overwinter
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-17 21:24:40	Grabbing some tasty grub at the Riviera Maya #excited
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-18 00:59:54	Thank the lord for best friends
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-21 16:47:01	Nothing like a haircut and a shave to make a brotha feel fresh #greatday
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-18 20:50:37	Cutting weight the old school way: sauna suit, shower maxed out hot, and calisthenics #oldhabits #takesmeback
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-19 12:44:31	Painting. All day. In a basement. At least I'm not wasting a nice day outside doing this #smallvictories
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-21 21:25:15	Call me reckless, but I'd like to try my hand at bull-riding. Sounds like crazy fun and thrilling to me #imightbetouched
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-19 22:09:21	I'm a little upset I don't have any of my weight-cutting clothes left #ohwells
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-20 20:40:57	The stuff you learn every day...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-20 20:55:21	@GiftedGinger only if you don't slow my gaming down =P
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-20 21:03:58	@GiftedGinger at least I get a choice in the matter... Wait... No I don't &gt;=|
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-20 21:56:24	@Bunchie9 @GiftedGinger oh, she will once the summer gets here lol
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-20 01:04:14	Also found out I'm going to be starting to run again. First goal time is 28 minutes for 4 miles #letsdothis
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-20 01:11:00	Having a sweat-out on this drive home takes me back... #funtimes #atleastitsnotjuly
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-20 23:22:24	@Bunchie9 False. It is.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-20 14:14:25	Word. Got wireless throughout the new house. Now I'll never be without music! #rule32
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-22 11:03:46	Well, that escalated quickly #butreally
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-29 01:34:34	Redbird with 4 strangers and a close friend... No way can this go awry...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-25 12:39:19	Just chilling on the 4th floor with a squirrel on the window sill... @GiftedGinger @sierraa_321
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-29 03:44:22	I am one fortunate man, and I'm glad I have the sense to realize it
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-29 05:12:11	Everyone deserves a vice.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-25 15:43:46	Waiting on that phone call that will never come
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-25 17:11:51	$400 tv at 25% off? I think I'll be taking that #toogood
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-29 07:07:48	I'm always one to worry about those I care about...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-29 07:29:08	When you bleed for someone, you know you care about them #honesttruth
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-31 01:50:33	I am all that is man! Well, at least a handyman #fixonthefly
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-31 13:47:17	Grifball and lazing about... I like this for an Easter tradition
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-26 00:50:29	I wanna roll on, roll on down that old river road #lacs
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-01 14:22:37	This weather better not be an April fools joke Indiana! #butseriously
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-01 20:01:26	Nothing like a good adjustment to get one feeling fresh
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-28 00:24:30	Heading to the riverboat with my homie Opie. Time to #winbig
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-28 04:59:10	Success! $150 up! #progambler
707588191	willbnicely	2013-03-28 05:14:34	Upon further review, either I started with more, or I forgot how much I started with and won more than I thought...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-02 00:16:16	@Bunchie9 quit getting your butt kicked and I'm sure that would go away =P
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-02 05:25:02	I'm set on cruise control and I'm slowly losing hope...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-02 05:39:53	Let me get that feeling again, that country cleansing my soul
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-04 02:01:11	...and I'm taking 30 second to bitch about the fact I'm *still* painting #nolife
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-04 02:14:14	@Bunchie9 don't tell me what to do like you know me! Don't act like you know my life! =P
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-04 02:19:02	@Bunchie9 honey badger don't give a shit
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-04 02:36:56	Done, but wired. There goes my plan to be asleep by 11 #tomorrowgonnasuck
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-04 03:47:11	Love doing so well in a game that people quit early because they get mad at how bad they're getting beat #ballerstatus
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-02 22:44:14	Snapple Apple is pretty delicious. I recommend it #rule32
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-03 02:17:05	It's been a busy day. I can't say I didn't enjoy it a little bit #whatswrongwithme
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-03 10:44:52	Let us see where today leads...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-03 13:11:45	I hate waiting on UPS in the morning. I got stuff to do all day!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-03 15:29:54	Old lady smell makes me feel ill #truestory
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-05 05:17:19	Why is it when I want to talk, nobody else wants to? #thissucks
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-06 10:07:07	Yea... I suck. You don't have to rub it in alarm.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-06 11:11:37	This is going to be a long day... #noregrets
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-06 13:37:00	They say those who stay calm in stressful situations are more depressed, and I believe it now
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-05 13:18:19	Is it 4:30 yet?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-05 18:08:11	A lunch on the go of dried fruit and granola... Rather satisfying, and healthy too #littlethings
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-07 00:56:18	My bro Mouch to me: "You're the closest fucking thing to Rocky Balboa!" #goodnightcoming
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-08 17:29:03	Oh, you know, just doing a little road farming.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-08 20:56:40	Luke Bryan sings it right: I don't want this night to end #onpoint
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-08 21:28:57	My heart just skipped 3 beats I'm pretty sure...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-09 14:11:42	I've been at work for 2 hours, and it feels like I've been here 2 days #justwannaseeyou
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-09 16:37:50	I'm gonna run like I'm 17 forever #youngheart
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-09 20:12:35	A little Ludacris helps make painting fun #butreally
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-10 18:56:52	I like storms. A lot.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-10 02:32:41	The seat next to me is rather empty... #wishyouwerehere
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-14 01:50:39	About to have a ridiculous night, if the past hour is any indicator. @GiftedGinger @sierraa_321
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-10 03:31:08	Why does laying down in my bed seem to always wake me up?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-12 14:25:56	I swear, I spend more time repairing boxes than I do putting shoes in said boxes...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-12 14:48:41	I miss when my life was about wrestling, boy scouts, and N64 #goodoledays
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-12 14:57:18	@GraceGibby for geometry, you could write stuff on your calculator lid... I mean, don't, because that would be bad... lol
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-12 15:34:01	When you're afraid to open your soul, you lose out on the best things #truestory
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-12 15:59:06	To stay involved in wrestling at a high level or not... #seriousdebate
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-10 12:30:45	Sitting at home for a bit because I slept wrong and now I can't lift my arm to get dressed #bullshit #howdoesthathappen
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-10 17:31:39	I'm sure I'll love how cold my basement stays in high summer, but it kinda sucks right now
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-11 13:52:43	How does my phone charge all night, but lose battery as it's charging? Is it giving electricity back to the electric company? #butseriously
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-11 16:42:59	I'm about to go off. I just want a hug to calm my shit down... #gingerrage
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-11 18:57:44	This mushroom is so raw, it told me the princess is in another castle! #boredatwork
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-13 10:45:36	4 sheriffs, 1 statie, and 2 unmarked just hurriedly pulled into the hotel lot we stayed at... #whatthehell
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-14 22:43:23	I hate it, but it means I'm getting closer to not having to say it the same way #anotherday
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-15 02:25:03	Time is up, you had your shot. Now it's time to give it up #django #default
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-11 21:44:31	I guess it's time to start shopping for a new truck... http://t.co/U9OrkD6i7C
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-11 22:22:20	*5 min after meeting someone* How could I forget about you? You're the only person I know #amnesiaprobs
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-15 14:43:54	The best relationships come from great friendships #truestory
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-15 22:22:56	I think it burns my sense of truth to hear myself shouting at my youth
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-12 00:23:42	Why does it smell like fish in Muncie? #whatthedeuce
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-15 16:31:29	New phone, and I saved $80 because I'm a business #sweettits
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-13 15:43:00	Hiding in shadows because the sun is roasting me at Perry
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-16 13:50:14	Excited about everything today for some reason. At least I'm not sad? #oddmoods
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-16 17:57:14	About to go Temple of Doom on my old laptop and rip it's heart out through the screen #gingerraging
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-16 21:21:09	Apparently I'm going to be dancing a lot in the near future #watchout #tryingnewthings
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-17 04:31:41	This lightning is rocking my socks. I love it!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-17 17:12:22	Credit card machines will be the end of my sanity
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-19 04:08:37	It's a long way down
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-19 05:08:12	You keep me feeling so young, I don't think I'll ever grow up, as long as you're with me #truestory
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-18 21:29:55	Let's feel the love, let's talk it up, let it pour out of your soul #mowgli's
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-18 15:35:07	Bobcat tracks in the snow. Tell me Mr. Bobcat, where is it that you go? #OCMS #bluegrassday
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-18 15:36:26	I really want to go chase some storms... #maybecrazy
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-22 02:10:27	Such a long weekend, and I still have an hour to drive home #sadpanda
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-22 02:17:26	At least my service engine light went off #littlevictories
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-22 02:56:56	Thank the Lord for rock and energy drinks #butreally
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-22 03:14:24	If you see a shooting star split in half, do you get 1, 2, or 3 wishes?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-19 03:06:27	Definitely have "San Francisco" by the Mowglis stuck in my head #greatsong
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-22 13:13:45	@GraceGibby haha pretty much how it's going to be
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-22 14:04:12	Instant mac'n'cheese cups are the best
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-19 17:37:30	Another long weekend, another (hopefully) decent payday come Sunday.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-19 17:46:29	I hate when I pick the wrong word and have to retype an entire tweet #annoying
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-22 16:29:21	I get a little adrenaline rush when my phone flashes critical battery and I have no idea where my charger is #panicmode
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-22 17:57:05	@GraceGibby I think tatted or math
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-20 12:51:53	Already to last Saturday's total, and it's not even 9. Good thing I have great help in @GiftedGinger  #butreally
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-21 13:20:54	You never grow out of tater tots #truestory
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-23 13:15:33	I have a really weird subconscious #weirdestdreams
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-23 13:41:47	@GraceGibby oh yea. Gotta find it because... shit, I don't know. It's pretty rad?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-23 13:52:24	And suddenly, I'm a dealer in basketball and volleyball apparel, along with wrestling #winning #makingthatcash
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-23 16:13:16	@AmberBowman lol I doubt it. Most of what we do is sublimation from the source company
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-23 16:21:54	@GraceGibby I figured you'd love'em lol
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-23 17:56:29	@AmberBowman lol it's not screened, but designed into the material
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-23 18:02:54	@AmberBowman it's usually done in-house. Now, the design part... do you use Corel or something like it?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-23 18:07:14	@AmberBowman oh ok. But they end up in vector (.ai I think) format?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-23 18:09:49	@AmberBowman ok. See, I could have you design stuff for me then =P
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-23 18:28:56	The opening fight sequence in Gladiator &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-23 19:03:09	My history's a little hazy, Cassius. Shouldn't the barbarians -lose- the Battle of Carthage?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-23 21:21:31	"I want to learn more about the weather." No way! Why else would you go to a road weather show? #areyouseriousbro
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-24 00:10:23	Just sipping a beer that tastes like a warhead... #heorot #finerthings
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-24 00:14:55	And now a beer that tastes like fruity pebbles #whatsorceryisthis
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-24 01:18:22	@Bunchie9 shut up. Shut it all the way up!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-24 01:20:15	@Bunchie9 it's a quote from my favorite webcomic, telling you to shut your mouth =P
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-24 01:22:40	@Bunchie9 I don't deny my nerdiness. I'm pretty much a nerd that could kick ass, but would rather settle it on Halo or Super Smash Bros haha
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-24 03:42:38	Deep thoughts and good conversations are what I live for. I'll always be a philosopher.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-25 02:59:31	@GiftedGinger yea... it's your fault because I was texting you =P
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-24 17:02:58	So much delicious Mexican food #puerta
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-24 17:23:31	Apparently, running is in my family. My brother, back in the day, ran down an elk while hunting #badassery
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-25 13:05:56	That's assuming I use the blades until they pull instead of cut, of course. Which is a terrible feeling
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-25 14:12:51	The white freestyle shirt front. Decided on a more classic look http://t.co/BiOAlGIzTS
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-25 14:38:15	Looks like I'm going to Daytona to officiate the cadet duals! #bettertakesunscreen
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-25 15:23:55	When sheriff recruits mistake you for one of their superiors #amused #notbad

707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-25 17:05:51	I hate how cold my office gets. I can't even nap at work! #seriousprobs
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-25 12:58:30	If I shaved every day, I'd spend approximately $220 a year on razor blades #nothanks #illdealwithstubble
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-25 14:29:46	@AmberBowman lol that's actually an old shirt design we used to sell about 15 years ago!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-25 14:37:20	@AmberBowman ah, don't worry about it. It's been off our shelves for so long, I doubt anyone remembers
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-25 14:45:19	@AmberBowman haha like we actually copyrighted that. Jim never had time for that stuff
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-25 02:30:32	Sucks coming home to an empty house all the time... #tooquiet
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-25 02:54:19	Why can't I stop thinking for, like, an hour? #seriously #annoyed
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-25 02:57:10	And then I drop the phone on my face...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-25 19:40:24	In Australia, a fisherman escaped a croc which was biting his head by punching it until it let go #manlyfact
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-26 14:09:37	Nothing like bagging and tagging singlets for an hour... #justkidding #thisblows
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-26 18:29:33	Beautiful day to be stuck in f#&amp;$ing traffic... #gingerrage
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-28 18:16:53	Baby kitties!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-28 18:31:12	This kitten is the most precious thing ever! @GiftedGinger http://t.co/oXt0goTFas
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-25 22:08:21	We have a word for that kinda odd in English. It's called suspicious #ingloriousbasterds
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-27 14:19:03	@AmberBowman you're about 4 hours behind lol
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-26 02:06:07	Making the "secret stair" from Lord of the Rings in minecraft... #epicnerdstatus
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-27 18:32:51	@Bunchie9 not have been born?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-27 20:46:59	Too bright for regular glasses, but too dark for sunglasses... what have I done to deserve this?! #seriousproblem
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-26 13:31:00	Almost done... just gotta keep that in mind #longseason #neverending
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-30 07:13:22	One of those nights when my body decides an hour of sleep will do just fine for the next day. There goes my sleep schedule #fuckit
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-29 19:06:13	When you nap so hard you're snoring #sogood
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-29 19:09:05	Window's down, radio's up. It's a great day to drive
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-26 18:35:35	Just saw the state trooper in charge of watching the work zone napping. I don't blame him. This shit ain't moving
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-26 19:20:25	Apparently I'm a butt for surprising @GiftedGinger by showing up an hour and a half early to hang out while she's at work #notsorry
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-27 10:32:28	Well... hello 230-wrestler tournament #shortday
707588191	willbnicely	2013-04-27 16:01:40	This is such a long day. All the time. For no reason.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-01 20:30:41	I was going to trim the hedges, but the motorcycle sounded way better #cruisingweather
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-01 23:45:46	Feeling anti-social this week for some reason #ohwell
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-02 03:45:38	I love how my basement is about 10 degrees cooler than upstairs #refreshing #loveit
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-02 03:50:28	I spend an hour in the sun, and my face just explodes with freckles #gingerproblems
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-01 15:07:02	Feeling bad, which means I only want 2 things in life: to cuddle with my girl and good noodle soup #bestmedicine
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-02 15:39:21	Nothing like taking the back roads on a beautiful day #countrycruising
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-02 15:59:37	Found a new road to take the motorcycle on #42
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-05 22:26:50	Jam sucka, JAM!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-06 16:41:16	Love me some Chocolate Moose with @GiftedGinger #delicious #shenanigans
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-04 18:49:20	Fire alarm at the state tournament. No big deal #dammit
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-04 20:20:41	I'm ready to be done and chilling in my room
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-07 01:19:15	Take my love, take my land. Take me where I cannot stand. I don't care, I'm still free: You can't take the sky from me #serenity
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-07 02:49:12	Shepherd used to tell me "you can't do something smart and do something right." #amen
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-07 03:00:24	Oh, I love how full of shit some people are #seriously
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-07 13:04:41	Starting my day off right with casual Tuesday at work #dontcare
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-08 10:09:03	Up early for a day full of fun (and hopefully making some cash) #michiganbound #soaringeagle
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-08 21:00:36	@GiftedGinger that's what $1300 in 5 hours looks like. #success #champions http://t.co/we9jHWWTar
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-07 17:48:09	Boom! The Ram for lunch, and then a new pair of kicks at the mall #goodday
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-11 13:20:56	When your girlfriend slaps herself in the face with your hand... #special
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-09 17:47:47	Doing work all day so I can go enjoy the Melting Pot with @GiftedGinger for her first trip there #gonnabetasty #waypumped
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-11 16:53:55	When you preach hate at the service, the holy water you've been anointed in has been poisoned
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-11 23:31:21	Man, 6 hours of paintball will definitely wear someone out #tired #greatday
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-12 02:55:43	@sierraa_321 I miss you! It's unfortunate my time off coincides with you being out of school =(
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-16 06:10:46	Sometimes, I really hate being as thoughtful as I am about everything...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-13 21:20:22	This is the end of the line. Beyond... it's what your imagination can barely fathom and your fear breathes to life
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-16 12:07:46	@GraceGibby you got it. I've seen you drop 5 pounds in a day. You can do 4 in 30 hours!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-16 12:36:16	@GraceGibby =/ I hope you can. Are you wrestling guys freestyle this weekend, or just the women?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-16 13:30:42	@GraceGibby well, I have faith in ya! And that's probably where you'll get more matches anyway
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-14 00:16:13	Halo and beer. Not a bad Monday night #solidchoice
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-16 18:37:24	Does anybody else ever wonder what the first person to milk a cow and drink it was thinking? #seriousquestions
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-15 23:34:27	I guess I'll do... Something? #boredtohell
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-15 23:54:12	I suppose I could start compiling recipes for my diet. But that isn't how I envisioned spending my Wednesday night #notevenclose
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-16 21:07:21	@DJ_ALLYBEAR you should try ozium. It works really well on a lot of odors. Gets rid of it instead of just masking it
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-16 21:08:49	@DJ_ALLYBEAR you're welcome! You can find it at like AutoZone and such =)
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-14 02:42:37	Funny when you don't take the advice you preach #hypocrite
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-14 04:45:34	Well... that was not expected... #nobueno
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-14 10:44:59	Glad I woke up early. It's going to be a long day...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-16 01:16:58	From 0-bar in 21 minutes flat #heorotoclock
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-16 03:03:53	And the weinerstompers take 1st in trivia! #sweetvictory #triviaboss
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-16 03:45:57	I've missed my friends so much the last 5 months. It's what I get for owning my business, but now I get the summer with them #winning
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-14 16:47:49	I'm going to be sad when @GiftedGinger goes back to school. I won't know what to do with my afternoons #seriously
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-16 17:02:18	I like how I look without facial hair, but shaving gets old when you have to do it every 12 hours to stay smooth #manlyprobs
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-18 02:01:38	That took forever... #displeased
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-18 02:18:07	Thank God I could make this drive from Indy to my house in my sleep #unfocused
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-18 10:52:08	So nervous about today. I just need it to get started and I'll be fine #jittery #anxious
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-13 13:52:51	When your girlfriend asks "do you want to play minecraft?" as you're about to get up #winningatlife
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-15 19:44:13	Too windy to ride -_-
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-19 11:06:45	Nothing like looking through a bag and finding $700 you forgot you put in there... #whodoesthat #butseriously
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-19 11:14:10	@sudsysmeeth lol it was from our third biggest tournament this year. Totally forgot I used that bag for that event
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-19 11:16:59	@sudsysmeeth to say the least, screw whatever else happens today haha
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-19 12:59:43	It's been a good weekend so far. Time to finish strong.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-17 20:14:19	They told me to just do it, and I listened to what that swoosh said.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-19 18:47:22	Good weekend. Just need to work on a few things, but people definitely recognize my strengths too #goodeffort #roomtoimprove
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-19 19:01:05	Time to get my tan on! #wiseguy
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-18 12:17:13	Boom. Time to ref #longdayahead
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-20 18:04:15	Today has definitely been a continuation of my ridiculously lucky and fabulous weekend. Must be the weather or something
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-22 03:43:08	I just saw a magazine article titled "Should killing female gamers in online games be considered rape?" #IsThisRealLife
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-22 05:07:09	I hate it when I fall asleep early and then wake up and can't sleep until some ungodly hour #annoyed
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-22 14:41:07	Back in the 160's. It's a good day #doingitright
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-20 20:48:38	I think it's time for a new tattoo #whattoget #needmoreink
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-18 21:05:27	Be the best at whatever you choose to do. There is no reason to be bad at anything by choice
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-22 21:59:05	Finally got to ride for more than 5 minutes! Hope I'll get that tan on my arms I want #keepdreaming
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-23 03:23:31	Ready for tomorrow to be done. Then it's a weekend of gambling, time with my family, and relaxing with @GiftedGinger #thegoodlife
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-23 03:58:27	My weather app on my phone says it's 64° out... with rain mixed with snow? #confused #denyingphysics
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-21 00:26:42	I feel pathetic now after struggling to do strengthening exercises for my rotator cuff...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-23 16:26:30	@GraceGibby what do you think of this singlet? Just found it in our store lol http://t.co/14jQ9ImhXa
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-21 19:40:38	I'd be so happy if this wind just disappeared so I could take the Harley out #bikerprobs
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-24 06:40:32	@GiftedGinger and @MPittsford . What a sucky friend =P
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-24 15:37:14	On the road with my love @GiftedGinger to Michigan
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-22 16:54:26	Tattoo on the chest, ribcage, back, or thigh? #toughchoices
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-27 04:25:25	@GiftedGinger just opened her first piece of mail at the house #awesomesauce
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-28 13:55:03	Must've slept on a torture rack, because it hurts my hips to sit, stand, squat, or walk.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-28 17:05:15	Oh, the times, they are a-changing
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-28 17:21:18	I could dig on some Jimi Hendrix with a cold beer this afternoon #oldschool #goldschool
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-28 23:37:17	My neighbor's dog literally went head first into the wood fence to bark at me #tard
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-30 03:43:21	I just discovered a full-length mirror in my house I had no idea existed #thehell
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-30 06:37:04	I'm about to commit crimes over this insomnia #butreally
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-30 14:12:50	Huzzah for only 4 hours of sleep... total... #whatiswrongwithme
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-30 17:36:35	Raging out at dumb bitches. It makes trimming the hedge fun though!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-30 18:33:24	One thing I hate about summer: I shower and get fresh, knowing I'm gonna be a sweaty mess in about 5 minutes once I go outside #thestruggle
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-29 04:04:37	If only #oomf was here...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-29 04:27:03	Struggling to stay awake to text that one person... #bestfeelingever
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-31 12:38:53	I'm glad @GiftedGinger loves me enough to wait with me while my tire gets fixed!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-31 18:17:47	@sudsysmeeth ok, we need a conversation about QC. Because I have SO MANY ideas I want to discuss about it lol
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-02 01:41:35	Just chilling in a holler with country radio on blast #simplesaturday
707588191	willbnicely	2013-05-29 14:50:53	You must be smarter than I, for I know little, and nothing certainly. So, teach me of folly and misplaced wisdom
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-03 17:49:42	If I'd have done it for the money, I'd have been a fucking lawyer #truestory
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-03 18:30:17	Here's the deal: I'm not easy to get along with, and I'm sensing you're a bit of a bitch, so...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-03 21:07:47	Nothing like the smell of fresh mulch to let you know summer truly is here #littlethings #simplepleasures
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-05 03:53:08	@Bunchie9 yea... we'll have those #nbd
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-04 02:11:05	That sweet relief when you think you're getting pulled over and the cop flies on by #whew
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-05 17:33:27	Doing that thing where I drive a whole bunch and move a bunch of stuff #sbduals #longweekahead
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-05 18:00:22	You done fucked with the wrong person #sillybitch
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-05 18:52:24	@Bunchie9 don't die!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-05 20:07:07	Now I'm doing that thing where I drive and try not to rage out #youhadonejob
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-03 04:05:53	@GraceGibby it'll be awesome! Why would things turn out any other way if that happened?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-03 04:26:41	What a great day with @GiftedGinger
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-07 03:49:03	My greatest strength and biggest weakness is my mind. Except knives. Those are pretty good against me.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-07 03:50:04	I shouldn't even be awake right now, since I've gotta be up so damn early #oops
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-07 10:48:11	Oh, how I almost regret being up so late #almost #sleepwhenyouredead
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-04 12:13:33	I actually enjoy going to the dentist #weirdlove
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-08 05:55:56	Sometimes, I hate myself. But then again, you are who you are
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-05 01:54:35	I'm ok with not having much of a social life outside my family and ball&amp;chain #contentment
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-04 15:16:53	You have a kid, you have no friends, barely a job, you've left the army once already, and now you're going to re-enlist? #getreal
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-05 21:37:03	But your picture on my wall, it reminds me that it's not so bad
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-03 14:44:10	@GraceGibby oh... Well... Lol
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-03 16:36:55	Yardwork, driving, tire change, mulching, and police station visit. Not a half-bad afternoon
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-06 01:51:26	I dig the new rule changes. Definitely extremely comfortable with them #forthebetter #oldschool
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-06 10:09:50	Gotta love when you feel it's going to be a good day!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-06 10:35:41	Neon Cathedral speaks to who I was. A little painful, but true, nonetheless.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-06 22:03:18	Not a bad day at all! Doing work for sure
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-10 16:10:04	Just saw a drive-in Christian church...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-09 23:52:34	Leaving for Daytona. Going to be a fun week of officiating and beach time, but I'll be ready to get home by next Sunday
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-07 11:03:15	You know she's in for the long haul when she learns to fold your laundry how you do because she knows how OCD you are #truelove
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-10 04:28:37	Have we really been gone 5 hours already?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-10 04:50:17	Well shit, looks like I'm going to be up most of the night #textsarewelcome #bored
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-10 08:07:30	Since when dos it take 30 min to fill up a bus? #onsomeshit #alottapissed
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-07 22:47:02	Well, today was a confidence booster. 3 recommendations for an upgrade, and I'm not even eligible until next year #winning
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-10 11:28:48	I'm ready to be off this bus. The amount of cold air in here is too damn high!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-10 11:43:04	Adcock pecans? All nuts, none the rest. #illpass
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-11 15:43:00	@GraceGibby What did I even do? Is it that bottle I gave you at regionals or something? Haha
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-11 20:23:49	Relax and react
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-11 21:44:09	Free barbeque? I'll take that all day!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-10 17:19:41	Awww yea son http://t.co/7RaZxZoLnB
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-12 11:33:50	If only @GiftedGinger could be the one waking me up right now... #withdrawals
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-12 17:01:30	Good morning session. Gotta keep it rolling #positivefeedback
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-12 17:16:49	Oh man, just laughed at myself for sleep walking last night. It's kinda weird waking up where you didn't fall asleep.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-10 20:02:05	Yea, this is our room #winning http://t.co/Evb9pqRrH6
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-10 21:13:29	@GraceGibby you should put blue streaks in your hair!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-12 22:04:08	Just saw a 280-pound man get a free flight for 5...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-13 20:47:04	Just worked the Cadet Greco duals finals #bigpimpin
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-15 10:51:27	Pretty sure I'm watching a mass baptism in the Atlantic out my hotel window #fascinating #prettyrad
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-10 22:21:45	@GraceGibby well, it's not in Fargo for one, and I think blue would look better. Though purple could be awesome too!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-10 22:26:35	@GraceGibby that could be pretty sweet too. It'd be something new for sure
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-11 07:22:54	I give up. I'm not the one, and you just had to say it. No more is this kid here for you, unless you change something
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-13 23:35:30	Apparently, it's mandatory to have a beer #social #goodtimescoming
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-13 02:42:43	I don't fit in, but I shall perform my duties to the best of my abilities and hopefully make up for that #socialoutcast
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-13 11:08:31	Going to be a good day at the mat hopefully. Greco finals and freestyle weigh-ins, followed by... something? #let'sgo #doingwork
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-15 18:23:39	Last dual meet, and then heading home!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-14 07:57:05	I hate getting the chills at the onset of getting sick #constantshivering #overit
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-14 07:58:00	I just want @GiftedGinger to be here to coddle me because I'm a bit of a baby when I get sick like this
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-11 18:47:51	Clinic time! #tons'o'fun
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-14 10:45:38	Oh man, my knees are shaking and tingly, and I can't swallow without pain. This is going to suck
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-12 00:59:48	The pressure is on, but I got that calm soul nothing like this can rattle #ready #pumped
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-14 17:26:39	I'm about to murder some napping at the venue #truestory
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-15 20:56:13	Homeward bound! #ready
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-14 21:45:15	Long day complete, all upgrade recommendations. And I felt like an elephant seal's butthole #likeaboss
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-16 02:35:01	It's just like the Titanic, but it's full of bears! #semipro
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-15 04:24:54	Sitting in the bathroom with the shower on max heat... I feel like I'm cutting weight again http://t.co/dxdX5vRevm
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-17 19:04:50	Beautiful day for a drive and loud music
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-17 22:02:44	Like a whiskey bottle drained on the floor, she got no future, just a love to endure
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-17 22:39:53	Rage Against the Machine on high volume makes me want to drive fast and punch everyone who crosses my path in the face
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-19 02:07:37	It's such a beautiful night out. I might just sleep outside tonight
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-16 13:53:38	And this ridiculous stretch of travel and officiating comes almost to an end. Now for the familiar drive home from LN.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-16 15:08:12	I'm just going to be honest here and say @GiftedGinger is the best ever #mindblown #epicsurprise
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-17 20:09:59	Getting my back and shoulder fixed. Going to some #sweetrelief
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-20 13:28:31	Already been on the bike for half an hour. It's going to be an excellent day!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-17 21:52:41	Wrong just seems so right until the spark of morning light
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-18 01:42:14	Huh. Guess I forgot to eat today...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-18 21:17:48	How you know where I'm at when you haven't been where I been? Understand?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-19 12:55:39	Bad poetry? Oh noetry!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-20 00:19:31	Shoot, I'm out of shape. But I'm too competitive to stop challenging all night #ultimatedisc #bosslevel
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-20 00:48:41	Using the wrong form of "your" on purpose because you know a friend is a grammar Nazi: #dickmove or #evilgenius ??
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-20 18:11:23	For having spent so much time on my bike in the sun, I'm really white. I mean, I don't even have a burn #whatsorceryisthis
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-20 18:48:02	Yea... sitting at home all day. So exciting...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-19 13:09:48	White Stripes got it right when they sang "You don't know what love is, you just do as you're told." #sillykids #cantbeserious
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-19 14:10:41	A smooth operator, operating correctly
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-20 02:28:44	Hearing your girlfriend stop mid-sentence to tell you she can hear cats having sex #feelingthelove
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-20 02:34:53	I don't know what they do, but Mexicans can make a great soda. Mango, pineapple, apple? Where's this at Coke? #butseriously
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-19 15:12:56	Aaaand signing up for coursework at BSU. This will be interesting...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-20 23:51:37	Stomach cramping every time after I eat a decent meal is really getting old #overit
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-19 17:42:55	Living in the age where villains do good and heroes use morally-suspect tactics, we need something new to combat both
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-21 07:43:36	Santana makes getting ready at 3am sexy!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-21 11:47:31	Waffle House in Lexington with my babe #roadtrip
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-21 13:05:31	Just went to a liquor store that is the size of a grocery #mindblown
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-21 14:23:42	Passing by the U of the Cumberlands. Seems like we've been driving #forever
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-21 15:07:50	@GraceGibby Nice! I didn't get to see much of campus though. We just passed by on I-75
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-21 15:14:05	Awww yea. $3.28 a gallon #winning
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-22 01:21:00	As life gets longer, awful feels softer, and it feels pretty soft to me #modestmouse
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-22 02:57:23	Deep, philosophical conversations are the best #truestory
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-22 14:07:05	Heading to Nashville for the day. Going to get me some of that good barbeque!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-23 21:05:42	Queen is the best general driving music. Just try it sometime
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-23 01:19:08	Movie time! #worldwarz
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-23 12:01:11	Internal clock has been set to wake between 730-8 apparently. Not that I'm complaining really.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-25 23:14:37	No one has ever taken a shot of tequila and been like "Ooh, that's lovely!" #truestory
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-26 01:57:10	I can feel a storm's a brewing for the oppressive silence mistaken for calm
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-23 17:56:37	Homeward bound with @GiftedGinger ! Going to be a fun drive into the night
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-23 18:37:38	Forgot to mention it last night, but saw World War Z on the Big D screen #nicename
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-24 14:04:21	They fixed the light at Nebo and 32! The sensors actually work the lights new! #tooexcited
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-24 18:40:50	Face down, or I'll stop your heart with my mind #losers
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-26 20:50:49	So. Many. Phonecalls. And I pretty much loathe talking on the phone to strangers #pricewepay #superpumped
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-24 15:02:05	@GraceGibby she doesn't have to make sure! I'll take great care of Melvin
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-24 17:19:40	Doing research on a new car, because my truck gets enough work with just 1 driver #somuchtoread #longafternoon
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-24 22:59:50	You're throwing a big party, but you can't afford diapers for your kid. #realwinner #dumbbitch
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-25 00:13:15	Jim Jeffries is quite possibly the most amusing comedian I've seen the past few years
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-25 02:00:52	When you literally LOL at your friend #greatnight
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-27 00:18:24	Working on giving myself heatstroke. I know this because I stopped sweating an hour ago #brilliant
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-25 02:48:12	Well, this storm came out of nowhere...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-25 17:34:32	Picking up a new furnace and a/c unit for the house. Spending that cash to save a lot in the long run
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-25 18:35:04	And now I'm inquiring about a vehicle. Maybe some new wheels will let me keep my truck all the time #i'mlookingatyou
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-26 12:10:14	Someone thinks I need new ringtones...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-26 12:38:07	I get some delicious, fresh-cut honeydew (favorite melon) because @GiftedGinger is the best ever! #sohappy #sotasty
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-26 17:30:41	It's awesome when someone wants to just observe you to learn how you do stuff #daymade
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-26 18:25:45	Being in sales is really helpful when you're buying something expensive #whatido
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-26 19:55:45	Bam! Doing work and getting that deal. @GiftedGinger should be getting excited!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-26 22:08:05	Time to tear up the ultimate field #bringitoooon
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-28 13:36:09	Debating if I want to watch anime all day or be productive. Well, not so much debating as trying to convince myself the latter is my choice
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-28 14:51:17	If you know the cost of a drink, you're probably an ugly girl.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-27 21:02:13	Off to Carmel to hang with the Turkish exchange wrestlers #coolstuff
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-27 22:17:56	I guess we sell internationally now. Well, only when they travel here anyway #ItsSomething
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-27 22:38:56	Let's just say I hate Indy traffic and leave it at that #thisisbullshit
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-27 22:48:03	Thank goodness @GiftedGinger has calmed me down, because I'd have descended into a ginger rage long ago #sohardtonot
707588191	willbnicely	2013-06-29 14:44:30	I quit. I've hit my head 3 times and I've only been up and about around 10 min today #whysaturdaywhy #ialwayslovedyou

707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-01 21:42:11	If I seem grim in countenance, it's only because I've been fighting a losing battle against idiots and their bullshit every day
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-01 00:50:45	@GiftedGinger has turned me completely into a cat person #lovethislittleguy

707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-09 18:54:08	What do you taste when you take a drink from Odin's Well?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-10 20:30:08	I like how I look in my newly washed jeans. Too bad they'll be dirty in like 5 minutes.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-10 22:15:24	And now we wait for everyone to arrive... #gamestoplay

707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-12 04:08:40	@MPittsford no shit! I almost ran someone over who cut in front of me like 5 minutes ago
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-12 04:10:51	@MPittsford all I gotta say is #tardlyfe
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-13 01:31:13	So many thirsty girls out here. It's kinda disgusting #seriously #pastyourprime #happilytaken
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-12 19:00:40	A nap would be wonderful right now... but instead, I'm walking under the Fargo sun #notmyfirstchoice
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-14 18:13:42	I think you're suffering from a lack of vitamin me
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-13 12:46:30	Oh God, I have made some poor choices in my life #hurting #tooearly
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-13 17:28:19	Best. Photo. Ever. @MPittsford http://t.co/ePg6eXzH9a
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-14 21:59:45	This headache will go away, lest I murder it.

707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-15 02:15:18	Is his last name Fargo? @courtney_gray_
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-16 06:27:43	Decent day. Wish I had more personal time for phone calls like that one, but oh well. I'll be home soon enough
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-15 07:34:31	What an entertaining night #goodtimes #gonnasucklater
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-15 09:07:09	That was some sweet relief from some shit on my mind.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-15 09:12:33	No sleep improves my reaction time and gut instincts #pastexperience #presentproblems

707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-16 19:20:31	Just stood in the suicide lane a couple minutes while trying to cross 17th for tacos, and the sun was the worst part.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-16 19:51:31	Nothing like watching some great Greco on the big stage #allday
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-16 22:02:46	@teeniee_weenie I know @GiftedGinger is free tonight!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-17 13:53:24	Getting a little draw team action in the women's duals today #funenough #letsjackthebrackets
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-18 07:17:27	A year ago today...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-18 09:28:55	Sleep is for the weak... or those who don't wake up early
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-18 13:43:46	That odd moment when you mistype an essential word in a sentence, but it still makes sense
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-17 23:10:50	Aaaaaand... We're back to the same old shit #ugh #notmyfavoritethings
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-17 23:28:53	Let's apply forgetful functors to the past and be a finite simple group of order two #kleinfour #mathlove
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-18 03:44:34	To be social tonight or not... #greatdebates #feelingintroverted
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-21 00:24:08	If only my shoulder didn't hurt, and I could wake up, tonight would get blurry real quick #ButItsNotTheCase
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-21 19:33:24	Hookah outside by the river... can't complain an inch #greatday
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-18 18:55:29	Holy shit, I get to leave my room today! #thankthelord

707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-18 22:10:05	First protest of the event. I'm surprised it took this long
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-18 22:17:04	@Bunchie9 something about a headbutt and brutality. Taking a look at the video I guess. I wasn't there for it
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-22 01:44:50	After class, come with me, and can I get a little but of TLC?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-19 02:22:43	Getting ready to leave tomorrow #pumped #readytobehome
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-22 04:39:19	If life's not beautiful without the pain, well I'd rather never ever even see beauty again
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-19 04:15:50	I'm going to murder some little shits tonight
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-19 07:45:18	This is fucking bullshit. Done with this gig.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-19 08:17:48	At least I'm seeing some great open sky this morning #greatview
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-19 08:50:26	Well, this was a waste of a trip. Should've just said no when I had the out. On the plus, I think I'll sleep on the bus home #insomniatweet
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-20 10:52:30	At the first stop, ready to roll on home #excited
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-20 11:13:41	The Cadet/Women bus around 1:30am est, somewhere in Wisconsin #efficientpackaging http://t.co/wFet4EmMY5
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-20 14:31:27	Oh my gosh, what is this? It has a/c, a comfy bed, and privacy... oh wait. It's my house #feelsgood
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-20 14:32:40	@maggiewilson8 nah, I decided you make the cut for who can follow me... but barely haha
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-20 14:36:06	Now, for a magic trick: I'm going to die in my pillow and resurrect later this afternoon #butseriously
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-22 15:33:14	I'm pumped to be back to a semi-final normal routine. Maybe I won't be up until 530am again for a while #wishfulthinking
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-22 16:15:58	@maggiewilson8 @courtney_gray_  I wouldn't go that far...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-22 16:33:32	@maggiewilson8 @courtney_gray_ blunt and honest haha
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-21 01:31:19	I wonder how long it will take before my sleep schedule returns to normal...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-22 16:59:59	Plates on the car!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-22 19:30:30	Debating some tasty ice cream... #ivanhoes #thestruggle
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-22 19:34:28	This cat just stood up, stretched, and flopped back down to nap some more. Yup, he's been learning from me.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-22 22:40:16	Fargo, 9 years ago. Me next to the tower of bottles my roommate and I drank in 3 days #throwback #ohgoodness http://t.co/vS6Dzqh5Vf

707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-23 00:05:58	I just got yelled at by a cat for moving because he was taking a nap...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-23 05:32:08	It's kinda bad when 2am is no longer a "late night," but "the usual." #strangelyokwiththis
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-24 00:00:56	So pumped! Just got the latest volume of Black Butler in the mail #manganerd
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-24 00:47:43	I don't know how I keep my plans straight, with all the people wanting to hang out #jk #teamnolife
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-23 14:09:42	Time to bust out the bike #awwyiss
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-24 12:33:20	Nothing like killing a spider that just crawled off your back within 20 seconds of waking up #ohgod #burningthesheets
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-23 19:28:41	Playing Xbox with glasses on is only a problem when I want something to throw #angerissues #GingerRage
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-23 19:46:31	Apparently I got better at Halo by going to Fargo? #confused #madskillz
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-24 14:33:20	@Bunchie9 @courtney_gray_ hey now... you don't have to stereotype me because I have no soul. I'm a person too... -_-

707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-26 20:09:08	Free bowling with my babe! @GiftedGinger
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-25 19:06:43	Spending so much time on the bike today #loveit #beautifulday
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-28 13:18:36	Roadtrip time!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-24 21:46:31	Don't play dead 'cause maybe some day I will walk away and say, "you disappoint me. Maybe you're better off this way" #aperfectcircle
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-25 00:26:17	I'll sacrifice my body for anything that remotely means something, so long as I enjoy doing it.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-28 19:33:25	Childhood win! @GiftedGinger http://t.co/uo51ZRa2ml

707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-25 01:46:12	So I took a walk #passionpit
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-28 03:14:27	Family reunion, then a bonfire and such before Wisconsin tomorrow #goodweekend #oshkoshbound
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-29 12:10:50	Day 1 of my first air show #pumped
707588191	willbnicely	2013-07-30 23:09:35	Nothing like waking up to 7 squadrons of P-51s and P-47s flying in formation overhead #badass @GiftedGinger http://t.co/nw2MFkOQkT
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-03 02:02:52	Thus far: pulled 29 gallons of water from the carpet, and we're about 65% done #doingwork
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-01 00:14:54	Driving home, and less than 2 hours in, I'm about to murderize @GiftedGinger
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-01 00:40:20	Limon Pepino, aka Lime Cucumber Gatorade... it's actually super refreshing! #love's #beloitstop http://t.co/YLVv8F2QLB

707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-01 23:05:27	I gotta go, I got a reservation: A tailgate for two underneath the stars
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-01 03:40:56	Back in Indiana... now just the 2.5 hours until my bed and I are reunited #sweetmeeting #toopumped
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-01 05:58:50	Home sweet home! #finally #thankthelord
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-01 03:48:03	A mile on the interstate and not a car in sight. Must be Fountain county #thesticks
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-01 15:54:05	@Bunchie9 thanks for the warning!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-03 00:50:26	Nothing like vacuuming up water out of a basement... #irate #workflow

707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-06 01:35:22	What am I, the Nevada Department of Hookers? How am I supposed to know these things?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-06 07:01:16	As a dude, sneezing while you piss is a terrible feeling #TrueStory
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-06 08:31:37	And now I'm awake, with no idea of when I'll fall asleep. Just how I wanted my night to end... #lies #justwannasleep
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-07 16:03:13	Tell us what's going on; it feels like everything is wrong
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-07 16:36:17	I read the bible, but I forgot the verses. The liquor store is open later than the church is #neoncathedral

707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-12 01:54:15	Gluten-free brownies, a free bowling ball, and a great birthday party today? I'd say it's a good day today!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-12 04:12:56	All I am is a man, but I want the world in my hands
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-12 05:28:43	Think of me in the depths of your despair
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-12 06:01:34	Nothing like a sweet drive for a couple hours at 1am on a Sunday with @GiftedGinger
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-12 15:14:06	I'm loving how red my beard is today #gingerpower
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-13 00:43:58	Some people are just stupid as hell. Like Leeroy.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-17 17:55:01	Oh, ya know, just chilling in the shade with the Mowgli's with @GiftedGinger
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-18 05:14:59	I'd say it was a pretty successful trip. And it'll be less than 24 hours if we get back by 6am! @GiftedGinger
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-16 16:47:16	Nothing like getting a little carpentry on to start my weekend
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-19 21:54:06	Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows? Yes please!

707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-20 15:22:12	I don't like you, and fuck you anyway. You make me wanna scream at the top of my lungs #afraid #theneighbourhood #goodsong
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-20 19:44:22	No wonder I became an alcoholic. This shit's ridiculous. At least I can get over it without a bottle this time around.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-20 14:40:31	I'm thankful this cat responds to snaps and finger points. It's hard to yell when you're brushing your teeth
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-20 23:08:21	I'd be unstoppable, if not for law enforcement and physics.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-21 00:47:37	The city lights have left me empty. They've replaced the stars that used to shine so bright. But I'll smile and keep you close
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-20 19:39:11	Sometimes, I wish I could've just moved across the nation...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-20 19:41:01	And now I'm depressed. Fucking great parenting... #bitter

707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-23 15:29:29	I get a feeling a racism, but it's not quite "Oh, that's obviously racist." Btw, this is on a cleaning product box http://t.co/OpxL4haXZL
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-23 05:17:54	Sometimes, this cat is a little asshole, all keeping me awake and shit

707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-27 14:56:54	Nothing worse than dropping something, going to catch it quickly, and tagging yourself in the nuts #guyprobs #ohgodwhy
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-27 15:42:26	I have no context for why my parents are the way they are, since I've no meaningful contact with their parents #randomrevelation
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-27 18:54:59	Your momma's so ugly, we put her on our propaganda posters to dehumanize the German people! #WW2smacktalk
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-28 05:36:07	Baby, you can crash my party anytime #truestory
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-31 01:52:30	You are (not) alone. You can (not) advance. You can (not) redo.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-31 17:18:29	Why I can't have nice things with @GiftedGinger #shetlandpony #restaurantsketching http://t.co/g5fYZmjOCF
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-29 15:57:39	I'm not saying I couldn't live without you. It's just that I don't really want to.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-08-29 18:32:28	Those who seek power for themselves are not deserving of it.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-05 07:01:14	Dreams are weird. Some show what you desire, done what could have been, and some what will be. How do you know which is which?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-04 01:51:42	Nothing like going nuts on some ultimate for 2 hours to make ya feel good
707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-04 05:30:42	In the cold distance, a wildcat did growl. 2 riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl #hendrixtime
707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-02 23:58:54	Time for a night ride!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-04 12:30:44	It sucks realizing nerve damage you got 9 years ago (in a non-contact sport, no less) is getting worse #CompetitiveIssues

707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-09 17:10:43	They used to be called Jumpolines... Then your mom got on one in 1974.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-10 10:09:18	Gotta love an early morning workout!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-10 10:21:34	Wrestlers appreciate the sweat you get going for 20-30 min after you finish busting your ass #truestory
707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-13 17:18:40	Just told an old lady protesting a gay man's funeral to take her bigotry to her own grave #ignorant #geriatricPOS

707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-15 15:36:07	Delicious math time! Panera Pumpkin Spice bagel + New York-style cheesecake cream cheese = pumpkin roll bagel! #tootasty #newaddiction
707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-17 04:15:59	I'm glad I have something to come home to. I don't know how I did it for 5 years
707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-18 12:34:15	Oh man, just watched the cat sprint, full tilt, through the house with his head stuck in a paper bag #toofunny #allthelulz

707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-20 01:23:23	Being told to execute every last bandit? If you want to challenge me, ask me to spare them
707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-22 14:18:27	I make good time when I want to #ProStatus
707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-25 14:27:32	I know it's about to be wrestling season when I get my headgear and mat tape stocking orders. In case I forgot what time of year it was.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-26 19:00:02	@LauraBean419 if you want some tear-away ones, I've got green/white striped ones @GiftedGinger won't let me wear around her lol

707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-30 21:05:17	So much to do, so much to see. It doesn't make sense not to take the back streets #throwback
707588191	willbnicely	2013-09-30 21:11:45	Forgot how much I like the Brookeville area
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-02 13:22:26	Baby, did it just get cold in here? Because our chances of bonding just went up #chemistpickuplines

707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-05 14:48:58	Preparing for "the Walk" with @GiftedGinger and @sierraa_321
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-03 19:31:01	Why is EVERY ROAD I USE REGULARLY under construction at the same time? Who hates me that badly... #unreal
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-03 19:37:29	But seriously, there is 1 north-south road from my house to McGalliard that isn't under construction from Daleville to Tillotson
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-07 13:56:56	Gonna make them revenues run #highrollin
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-07 18:13:15	Just fixing a roof. It's a beautiful day to do it though!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-07 18:39:12	Just found this beauty in the attic. Last patent given on it was filed in 1934, awarded 1936. http://t.co/TDlYZg4C7J
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-07 18:41:14	That would be a Kodascope Eight Model 80 projector
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-10 10:14:06	Coach's clinic at Warren Central until this afternoon #easyday
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-10 20:34:59	Well my day just got, like, a bazillion times better!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-09 15:46:29	Gaaah! Swiss-fucking-cheese! Ahh! Aaah! Icky monsta! Icky monsta! #ragequitting
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-15 14:37:08	I hate hospitals.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-14 15:51:46	I have the fluffiest kitty at my house thanks to @GiftedGinger
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-17 13:52:29	Wake Me Up by Avicii + Aloe Blacc is a song people should check out
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-17 14:21:53	I love when I've driven a way so much I make all the turns without even paying much attention
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-15 00:25:03	Just rapped about drinking a rockstar while waiting on my buddy #goodmood
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-17 13:03:32	Hold me close; we're losing time. Hold me close; we're falling to the ground #royalconcept
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-18 14:06:16	I will never settle, settle, chasing down the devil, devil #SirSly
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-18 14:08:25	You gotta spend some time, love. You gotta spend some time with me, and I know that you'll find, love, I will possess your heart.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-18 14:17:37	This radio set is on-fucking-point
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-18 14:19:00	I'm a shitty romancer baby, I ain't gonna lie. But I'll be damned if it means I ain't gonna try
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-18 15:11:54	Well that was definitely an end to my good mood...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-19 05:54:25	217! I'm just a little bit excited about that
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-19 21:06:08	When you can describe your comforter as "too fucking tits", ya know it's a good one
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-18 15:57:36	All this time I was finding myself and I didn't know I was lost
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-23 00:54:18	...the cat just ran full tilt into my legs. Not worth tweeting about if I hadn't been standing in THE SAME SPOT for 5 min doing dishes #tard
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-20 19:15:12	Oh, ya know, just playing fetch with the cat #nbd
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-21 21:13:08	I quit playing with the cat's laser 15 min ago, and he's still hunting for where it went...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-24 20:55:41	Got the drank brewing, the ingredients for tomorrow, and the house is clean. Time to press my pants and shine my shoes
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-25 15:27:36	I'm getting antsy... a little bit left to do, but I have to travel to Decatur for a funeral
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-26 03:24:03	Oh, what a birthday! http://t.co/QkTN6Ww6HV
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-26 15:11:54	Pretty sure I shouted "I'm like a fucking phoenix!" last night as I sprinted upstairs. Thanks for reminding me @GiftedGinger
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-26 18:15:02	Last night... that was a way to kick in my birthday #epic #feelthatforawhile
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-27 15:05:47	I tried watching folkstyle... and I got bored #FreestyleFTW
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-24 15:24:37	The Last Ones Standing by Ceann... definitely describes my friends and I
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-24 15:53:28	We call it Jesus Juice because, after a night of drinking this, you'll have found religion upon waking up #It'sThatGood
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-24 17:01:37	Looks like party time! http://t.co/jumhOepnaS

707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-28 14:14:27	Woke up feeling isolated and thoroughly pissed at everyone because of my dream... #notmyfavortething #stillraging
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-28 20:34:03	I think it just hit me today I'm a year older now. Coincidentally, I also finally feel "normal" from Friday night.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-29 18:01:40	Ok, definitely feeling the age thing happening. Just discovered my beard is turning salt and pepper after trimming it...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-29 20:06:46	"Sir, we're surrounded!"

"Excellent. We can fire in any direction."
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-31 15:13:25	Nothing like a little minecraft to kill a rainy afternoon #NerdToTheMax #DontCare
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-01 01:31:17	Looking back... I've had an interesting life thus far. I am pleased with the roads I've traveled.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-30 21:00:59	Bored as dicks at Ben Davis #saveme
707588191	willbnicely	2013-10-31 00:26:01	I just got way too excited thinking about shaving with a cutthroat razor tomorrow morning #classic #dapper
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-01 17:01:15	And the road goes ever on and on... #epicmusictime
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-01 17:03:41	The only brew for the brave and true comes from the Green Dragon
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-01 18:21:30	Nothing like a compilation of halo and Lord of the Rings music to help drive faster #NurdLyfe
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-04 00:13:39	Life is a game for everyone, and love is the prize
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-04 00:49:50	Instead of who we were, let's start thinking of who we're gonna be
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-04 02:37:03	@Bunchie9 sweet, I'll check on them tomorrow!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-04 17:01:15	I actually like doing the book keeping and inventory aspects of the business more than dealing with people...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-07 04:35:57	First attempt shaving with a straight razor, and I didn't cut myself! Now, to cut down the time it takes...
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-07 15:47:23	Marion County sheriff's training facility, Perry Meridian, then to the store. Lots of driving today! #favedays
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-07 15:52:34	I think I like driving so much because it's obvious I have a goal, and my progress to said goal is readily apparent
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-07 16:41:48	Fuel at $2.99? Don't mind if I do!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-10 03:24:53	My ex girlfriend had this really weird fetish where she'd dress up like herself and act like a total bitch #ComedyCentralGold
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-08 06:31:15	It's a good thing I'm a sports junky #goodchats
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-07 18:46:55	@LauraBean419 mint oil. They hates it. Use it like salt for witches (that's a thing, right?)
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-08 14:33:07	I'm already on edge. Don't make me go "murderous ginger rage" on you with your stupid sassery #frigginpunk
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-08 14:36:59	Working in fast food when you're 34 as main line prep doesn't give you the right to say shit to/about me #FuckOff #ICanHearYoDumbAss
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-08 16:09:41	You know you've been to an area too much when the petrol attendant asks if you want an Amp with your fuel..
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-11 15:23:26	Oh, ya know, just moving 1,900lbs of mat tape 30lbs at a time... #workoutoftheday

707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-12 16:33:53	People need to calm the fuck down on Christmas. It's not even close to thanksgiving yet
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-09 23:57:43	"I don't hump people as much as I used to." Well that's a relief... =P @GiftedGinger
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-12 17:37:47	It's funny seeing people wearing a high school letterman jacket at college #freshfish

707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-18 07:51:45	When I wake up and you're not next to me, I'm afraid I've dreamt everything that's happened between us #WorstFear
707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-19 18:46:00	I just accidentally tazed the cat with static... #mybad

707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-03 17:24:50	I suck at long tweets
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-03 17:25:38	I'm just on a roll, being all productive and shit today #OnThatFlow
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-04 05:25:46	Oh gosh, it's karaoke night, and I'm on the mic every 4th song #RockIt #RepIt #FuckICantDoThisSong

707588191	willbnicely	2013-11-30 23:18:29	Too true. http://t.co/QSc3aYdw6j
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-01 23:33:40	All I wanted to do was watch YouTube vids on my phone under my blanket with the cat, but YouTube has to suck right now #slightlysad #lost
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-01 23:36:58	I guess I'll just play minecraft. Not like I have a social life on Sundays any more anyway...

707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-04 09:31:07	Screw this not being able to sleep thing. I have work in 4 hours #nothappy
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-06 14:07:32	It's not that I can't see without my glasses. I just can't see far away without it looking like a smudged watercolor painting.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-06 14:16:29	Also, the feeling of not wearing them after wearing them almost every day for almost 7 years is extremely unsettling. Like forgetting pants.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-09 22:16:37	Good first day of practice. Hopefully I didn't scare anyone off.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-08 20:23:18	Hrrrr... that laugh... I was thinking about waffles @GiftedGinger
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-08 22:52:16	Well, this was a pretty top first weekend for the season!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-10 16:13:29	The newest headgear we stock! Pretty sweet White/Royal and Gold/Black signatures http://t.co/UZXnjxptQX
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-11 16:35:00	Just dropped a headgear I'm moving to a different shelving unit, and kicked it into the bin where it's supposed to go #SoNinja #Skiiiiillz
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-11 18:39:20	You know you have it made when you can determine that it's going to be Casual Wednesday because... why not?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-10 23:13:44	Nothing like a good straight shave to make one feel better
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-12 16:42:31	Watched my cat parkour off the couch and into a trashcan... #ICanDieNow #TooGreat
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-14 03:02:12	I like that @GiftedGinger is willing to let me play halo instead of spending time with her #manchild
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-15 23:28:43	"Get on my dick!" @GiftedGinger
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-15 23:30:10	That's what she said to me when I wouldn't get up. Really?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-16 04:08:18	Just a night in of gaming with @GiftedGinger http://t.co/9cWxtIfwo5

707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-25 20:23:37	@Bunchie9 look at it this way: You've got a good start to a "respectable collection" of movies
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-25 21:20:02	@Bunchie9 I mean, it's the way to do it. Nothing bad with keeping around the good movies!
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-21 21:13:20	Glad my phone thinks I'm in downtown Muncie, even though I'm at the Anderson zoo (aka Wal-Mart)
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-22 14:30:15	Well, time to get up and start on this plan. Ambition isn't going to succeed all on its own.
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-22 17:52:44	So far, I'm at 20 ppt slides of things to consider for a coaching position, with probably 6 more to go. This is going to be epic
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-26 20:43:58	Heard one of my wrestlers just convince another he had a 3rd nipple on his butt, but had it surgically removed #really?

707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-30 03:56:03	Well this turned into an adventure! #UnexpectedJourney
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-30 04:20:08	All I could read on a billboard was "sexapalooza." I wonder what that is about?
707588191	willbnicely	2013-12-30 10:13:40	I never went bungee jumping. The closest was when I was born.
707588191	willbnicely	2014-01-03 16:51:26	Gas station guy tells me they have no pumps working, but my apparently-magic touch got me 8.5 gallons (and an impressed look) #winning

707588191	willbnicely	2014-01-04 20:26:06	Good day officiating with a boss crew and some good teams. I'm not gonna complain.

707588191	willbnicely	2014-04-16 14:16:34	I'd be the most useless weather indicator ever. You'd know if it was really freaking cold, cold-warm, or toasty out.

707588191	willbnicely	2014-07-07 00:24:00	Brooke, @GiftedGinger said you need to shit the f*** up about that retweet. You're skinny enough as it is haha
707588191	willbnicely	2014-07-07 01:08:28	@Bunchie9 you obviously don't remember retweeting an image a few hours ago lol

707588191	willbnicely	2014-07-07 01:24:27	@Bunchie9 you're a loner? I would argue against that, but that's just me. And yea... eating is a nice thing to do all the time

707588191	willbnicely	2014-08-06 17:47:30	Well, here goes nothing...
707588191	willbnicely	2014-08-07 14:08:48	I'd have made a great construction worker in the early '20s
707588191	willbnicely	2014-08-08 17:02:57	Spent $200, saved $400. I'd consider my shopping skills pretty solid.
707588191	willbnicely	2014-08-08 20:45:49	We're flying through space at 29,800 m/s, but when I see you, we're motionless to the universe
707588191	willbnicely	2014-08-11 22:31:21	B-MO chop! If this were a real attack, you would be dead.
707588191	willbnicely	2014-08-13 13:03:05	So, "bunning" is when a guy/girl lay feet to feet, then one kicks the other in the crotch for "sexual pleasure?" People have odd dreams...
707588191	willbnicely	2014-08-13 13:03:48	I looked it up, and bunning actually means toking up. But hey, now there's a reference to it meaning something else.
707588191	willbnicely	2014-08-13 13:05:53	Thinking about it, now that it's been posted on the internet, someone WILL develop that into a fetish. At least I didn't dream it up
707588191	willbnicely	2014-08-15 09:06:54	Beer, fight, police, pharmacologist job, flooding house on a lake, and snow in boxers, boots, and a boonie hat. Interesting dream...

707588191	willbnicely	2014-09-29 04:40:44	I lol at people bitching about children they have unplanned with an unsuitable partner. Honestly, what did you expect? #ComeOnNow #Hellbound
707588191	willbnicely	2014-09-30 02:37:16	Definitely had a full conversation with my cat. I'm pretty sure he had an interesting night, with his answers to my questions #CatDudeStatus

707588191	willbnicely	2014-09-28 22:06:49	Just think: humans used to run after animals until they were too tired to run any more and either died or gave up. "They" being the animals.

707588191	willbnicely	2014-10-16 15:04:26	Today feels like one of those days you don't have much to do, but you have an unnecessary amount of urgency to do what little there is

707588191	willbnicely	2014-10-21 10:33:07	At least it's not a full flight #ExtraElbowRoom
707588191	willbnicely	2014-10-21 12:38:56	Entire row to myself from IND-MCI ~and~ from MCI-LAX. What did I do to deserve this?!
707588191	willbnicely	2014-10-23 15:09:38	Fffffffuuuuuuuu...

This headache can suck it.
707588191	willbnicely	2014-10-23 15:43:26	And we always say "it would be good to go away someday." Yea, but if there's nothing there to make things change...

707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-11 06:23:53	@JSalata that would imply Canadians are the unhappiest people on earth
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-11 07:01:25	Apparently I'm a sucker for the long/skinny type? I would absolutely beg to differ dude
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-11 08:01:52	I claim New Religion is my song, but she doesn't get it; it was all before she was born
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-13 21:53:32	Guy's got some jokes, thinking I give a shit about what a do-nothing high school coach "wants his kids to know"
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-14 14:20:13	I forgot what life was like on 4 hours of sleep. Boy, have I missed this feeling! #SarcasmBeam #MaximumPower
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-13 14:36:47	Only spending $130 on my gas and electric bills is kinda nice #OldStatus
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-13 15:05:36	Dropped my phone down 5 steps, then it fell over a 4' drop onto the corner of a hard cooler, then watched it skip across tile #HeartStopping
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-15 00:20:19	Memories are so frail. It takes one bad one to ruin an entire lifetime of good ones. Pretty disheartening to think about
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-13 17:46:43	Putting my luck to good use playing Peggle all day.
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-15 00:48:45	One of the worst things about winter: frozen spitters
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-15 16:01:13	And suddenly, BOOM! Adventure time on the road
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-16 08:33:52	Peggle at 3:33am and jamming out to Pandora solo on a Saturday night. Because I know how to party
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-17 04:14:47	Unable to answer a simple question? Yea, tell me more about how you got your shit together...
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-17 04:22:33	On another note, worst thing about winter is cold bed sheets right when you lay down. Should've got the heated mattress option
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-16 10:58:26	Oh my god! It's just like that old gypsy woman said I was going to die!
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-16 11:50:15	I should've made my basement the bedroom. But then again, getting a bed down here would've been a nightmare
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-15 20:37:20	When someone pulls the race card on you, then says they're joking #OhGodWhy #Awksauce
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-18 19:21:49	People look at me like I'm insane just because I'm going to the school in shorts and a T. Like I want funk all up in my jackets #PassOnThat
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-15 21:00:59	This 3 hour drive blows. I just want a nap
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-17 15:54:26	Ordering Chinese online, because I don't want to sit there awkwardly while they make my food, and I can't understand them over the phone
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-15 23:03:43	I'm getting too used to bowling on the weekends. I don't know what I'll do when I actually have to work all weekend
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-15 23:57:41	At least I got to see some aurora borealis action on the drive home!
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-17 16:21:00	There's blood (and a good bit of it) on one of my tables. No idea where it came from either...
707588191	willbnicely	2014-11-16 16:09:59	Just trapped a spider bigger than a half dollar under a drain cleaner bottle. Didn't have anything flat handy to murder his ass

707588191	willbnicely	2014-12-06 23:26:50	I'll be counting up my demons, hoping everything's not lost
707588191	willbnicely	2014-12-05 22:38:20	I love traveling, and usually don't mind going solo, but sometimes I hate being alone on the road
707588191	willbnicely	2014-12-06 00:46:44	Meat burps are the worst!

707588191	willbnicely	2014-12-10 09:33:07	Well that was an unnerving dream. Not quite a nightmare, but an awk-mare
707588191	willbnicely	2014-12-10 14:53:41	I dreamt I had a big court case and mad media coverage, all because I called a guy a dickbag over his crap parking job and he sued me

707588191	willbnicely	2014-12-22 14:37:36	I could list my failures, but I'd probably fail to get them all down. No point in dwelling on it then, I suppose.
707588191	willbnicely	2014-12-23 16:24:56	Waffle House to cure the hangover. Not the healthiest, but it's better than suffering through the backside of a bottle of whiskey
707588191	willbnicely	2014-12-26 06:35:49	Up and getting ready, because I like to get started on a long road trip when nobody else normally drives

707588191	willbnicely	2015-02-26 02:45:42	Tanning after a workout might be my new favorite thing
707588191	willbnicely	2015-02-28 02:42:43	7° outside, and I'm in shorts and a crewneck sweatshirt... am I half Canadian or something?
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-02 21:13:02	2 full mats, and 4/5 groups wrestle inside one circle... what is wrong with these kid's sense of spacing?
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-04 18:06:29	I now know what a $3,300 safe looks like (and feels like to move)
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-04 23:46:49	Nothing like watching a lot lizard go for a ride #Eww
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-06 15:15:59	I need to be on my game today, and yet I'm struggling to get motivated. This is the worst part about depression
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-06 15:21:03	On the plus side, I have my responsibility as a business owner to push me to get shit done. So there's that to help me out
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-05 22:42:42	When you say "we'll have to have one more" and your drinking partner says "no no no" #OutOfControl #ThirstyThursday
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-05 22:45:36	Of course, that's with 32oz margaritas that are 25% tequila. Discretion is the better part of valor... and not puking http://t.co/l73hOvRj6k
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-07 07:32:25	I will end someone. As in, right now.
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-08 16:37:29	My body feels like it's vibrating, and it's kinda weird
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-09 04:37:56	@courtney_gray_ that's why you screw their plans and kick ass!
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-09 22:33:08	Time to mine! Or fight wizards. Whatever happens first
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-11 00:29:59	@sierraa_321 water. Lots and lots of water.

707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-14 16:31:48	When you have such a large taco bell order you just hand the cashier the paper... #Murica
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-13 19:05:56	Time for another state tournament. Hopefully it runs as smooth as last week did
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-16 21:33:32	Just watched 2 corgis bullying a dog twice their size by constantly running under it's legs #TheThingsYouSee
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-17 01:04:33	Casino time, because I can
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-17 03:18:05	Bet you $2k this casino was worth it #MoneyMaker
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-17 03:22:28	A full wallet, whether it's 1s or 100s, is still super annoying
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-17 17:41:01	So... spontaneous trip to Las Vegas in 3 weeks? I'm down
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-20 14:31:31	Not to brag, but I am the best at cardboard box repair #AlmostUselessSkills
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-21 18:57:35	I'd move to Indy just to avoid the 90 minute drive home from anywhere I work around here
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-23 18:15:45	I hope I'm on point with this marinade for these pork chops. I'd be hella sad if I wasted good pork with a shitty flavor
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-25 04:43:52	Old Crow Medicine Show is great late night driving music
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-25 16:02:54	They're making the new Colorados in yellow! I can finally get my yellow truck without having to buy 4 or more #DreamsComeTrue
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-26 11:27:03	Ready to roll. All I need is my emergency Brisk tea and some beef jerky
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-26 12:03:05	Going the speed limit isn't really my style guys. Can we please pick the pace up?
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-26 14:57:14	Gotta love straight roads for the old autopilot
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-26 19:56:19	Couldn't have picked a better day to drive 12 hours! It's absolutely gorgeous out
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-26 20:29:10	But I won't cry myself to sleep 'cause my soul no longer weeps, for my body lies in the heart of this sea #FloggingMolly
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-26 23:53:07	@JSalata officiating. I can barely stand coaching my middle school, I dislike folkstyle so much. You going?
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-26 23:44:00	First sign for Oklahoma City! #AlmostThere
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-26 23:56:41	@JSalata Sweeeet! Gonna be a good time then haha
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-27 01:39:32	Wooo! Room to myself tonight! Time to party up... in my dreams. Today has lasted forever and a half
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-27 13:43:28	Just had the loveliest chat with a British(?) gent on my way out the hotel. Certainly brightened my morning
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-27 14:58:41	Just drove from my hotel to OCU by visual memory from one trip I took last June. I think I found my hidden talent...
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-29 13:51:28	Well, I guess this is the time I start thinking about all the terrible stuff I called yesterday so I can dwell on it for 12 hours
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-29 01:32:21	After a long day, I can say the crew worked awesome and we got shit locked down at nationals. Now to relax and let go for a bit
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-29 16:39:20	I think I'm moving to Tulsa because I just kinda want to give up on driving, and it's the next major city
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-29 20:19:24	All I can think is it's such a shame that I ain't learned a damn thing #JamSesh
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-29 23:33:15	I haven't seen below 55° today, and I'm so ok with that
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-30 00:42:12	Everything's not lost
707588191	willbnicely	2015-03-31 23:38:35	Home cooked teryaki chicken on a bed of brown rice and steamed veggies... and now I'm about to fat flop
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-02 14:13:03	Everyone's a whore. We just sell different parts of ourselves.
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-02 14:43:17	Ever catch yourself in a reflective surface and be like "Damn, I'm looking good today"?

Yea, it's one of those days today.
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-03 22:23:26	This guy... http://t.co/ILncdfDTod
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-05 13:40:11	Just going to leave this here... #HappyEaster http://t.co/7AUbRgjwFe
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-05 14:01:36	Gonna be in Vegas in 24 hours...
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-08 15:30:10	Valley of Fire, Nevada. Highly recommended, and you feel like you're in the middle of nowhere (which you kind of are)
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-06 19:33:00	Being an adult means looking at a calendar and going "Ya know, I can squeeze in a 5 day vacation in 3 weeks. Let me book that shit stat."
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-08 02:17:13	This civil war documentary on the history channel is pretty awesome!
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-08 02:27:05	Nothing like a war to advance technology. Just look at rifling and the minié ball during the civil war
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-08 02:57:22	The US civil war cost 2% of the American population. Today, that would translate to roughly 64,000,000 deaths.
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-10 21:42:47	It's hot as balls in this greenhouse of an atrium. Worst part about working at Perry, hands down
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-09 07:05:09	Definitely not ready to leave Vegas tomorrow. I like not being obligated to anyone but myself and just bumming it daily.
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-17 00:53:57	Nothing like being asked to wrestle in a tournament after 3 years of not wrestling competitively
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-18 12:02:12	Ready to have a good day on the mat at the Yorktown Ironman
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-18 19:15:46	Just lost 2 pounds officiating? #whut
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-18 20:05:17	Serious question: who puts a racing spoiler on a regular truck?
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-18 20:06:06	Answer: someone from Anderson #OfCourse
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-18 01:51:54	The coach for the Predators looks like Don Sutherland 10 years ago.
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-19 13:18:21	I feel so dirty wearing my grey officiating shirt... #Olympic4Life
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-22 11:33:33	Lasagna is just spaghetti-flavored cake
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-26 19:09:52	Workin' hard all week puts the beer on the table
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-28 17:17:08	Sadness is seeing half a package of twizzlers uneaten on the road
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-29 14:35:24	I'd rather be lucky than good, tough than pretty #ColtFord
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-29 17:09:33	Wildflowers, just like you, lay on me like morning dew
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-30 16:06:41	Hail? Really?
707588191	willbnicely	2015-04-30 22:06:32	Her eyes twinkle like stars, not because they shine, but because they are so far apart.
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-01 20:17:20	Charlie Daniels said it best: I don't have money, but I have it made
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-01 20:50:46	I like working at Avon in May for 2 reasons. First, it's a nice place. Second, it means the rest of the year I'm officiating.
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-01 11:07:32	Everyone's all split into "hashtag or pound sign" camps, and I'm all "ya know, it's proper name is an octothorpe actually..."
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-01 16:17:55	I feel like I've got a permanent supply of nitrous in my system today. I hope this is gone by tomorrow!
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-01 18:14:04	Just watched a woman resisting arrest on IN67... it lasted about 12 seconds. Wonder what she was possessing...
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-02 22:04:08	I can honestly say I don't think I was directly responsible for a coach being truly upset today. I think I won officiating today
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-03 21:46:05	Nothing like the grind of 20 some championship matches straight to mentally drain you
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-05 04:17:54	Nothing like binge watching a new anime
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-07 02:41:29	No one cared who I was until I put on the mask
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-07 03:05:13	I love the Killer Croc reference in the Dark Knight Returns
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-07 00:31:24	I love how the Joker just "appears" in the Dark Knight
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-07 00:39:31	There's a lot of potential for aggressive expansion... Oh, there's only one spot open right now, so we're going to have try outs.
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-07 01:00:42	I'm also a huge fan of how the Joker changes the narrative of how he got his scars every time
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-07 01:18:16	To win against monsters, one must give up one's humanity and become a monster
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-07 20:26:49	I could drive to the gas station, but why not walk? I literally have nothing to do...
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-09 04:31:43	You know someone is high as balls when they bring their family-size McDonald's bag into Taco Bell
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-12 21:50:32	Remember your dreams, and run with them.
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-15 17:34:21	Dallas roads can suck a fat dick. This is an abomination of civil planning
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-15 17:39:59	I will admit though, the Pizza Hut/Taco Bell combination is pretty top
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-19 22:56:14	I love singing while cooking. It's so darn relaxing
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-20 22:37:39	Moments when you say what you should. Moments when you say something better. #AviationHigh
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-21 02:10:36	I swear, when I drive so long solo, I go through mild psychosis
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-20 15:15:04	Wooo! Tennessee!
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-21 05:15:41	Hardcore deja vu right now
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-20 17:19:26	On you, even fear looks good
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-21 06:29:35	15 hours later, and I'm back home, ready to be dead to the world for a few hours
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-20 19:27:57	When I jam out while driving, I have to look insane to other drivers...
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-20 19:35:12	Life mystery solved: I now know how they change the bulbs on those giant light posts on the interstate.
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-20 19:51:16	Stopped traffic for 9 miles and counting... glad I'm on 75 south. Might have to detour home
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-20 20:33:45	Apparently everyone and their mum stops at the Williamsburg Pilot to fuel
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-20 23:41:01	You said I'm crazy; if I am, I'm crazy for you
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-22 16:06:57	Wild berry smoothies from Panera are what dreams are made of
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-24 13:21:07	Fuuuuuck is this hangover bad. Damn you Capt. Morgan for being so rum-y and pineapple-y and delicious-y
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-24 13:22:10	On the plus side, it's one less thing I have to pack when I go home
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-27 22:09:30	First day of ultimate, and I'm more excited than Christmas when I was 12
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-28 21:00:33	Gotta love having both the 360 and Xbox One hooked to the same tv. Means seamless transition from one game to another
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-28 19:08:49	When you can hear your cat smashing around upstairs, and you know exactly what room he's in #plzdontbreakshit
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-30 16:07:08	It's always hard saying goodbye, especially when it's forever...
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-30 21:25:05	Good friends make a hard day easier. Remember that
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-31 16:29:44	Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm weak. Maybe I'm blinded by what I see
707588191	willbnicely	2015-05-31 16:32:34	Theory of a Deadman and GTA V go pretty well together
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-02 04:18:26	Nobody's singing about you anymore. You thought you heard it, well you must've heard wrong.
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-03 00:00:29	You know she's good with her hands if she's deaf #DrunkSpeak
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-01 05:56:09	@TheLifeDiaries Jealous is possessive of something you have. Envious is wanting something you don't have
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-01 05:57:48	Learn the language you speak #English101
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-01 06:09:03	Any good gambler knows, sometimes you gotta fold, sometimes you gotta stick it out
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-03 03:37:15	I feel like Archer with the tinnitus I'm suffering from right now #Mawp
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-03 03:56:40	Why do I feel like the lone house that survived the hurricane right now?
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-03 04:47:41	My fitbit has gone from the 1-2 strap length (loosest) to 3-4 in 5 weeks. I'm too happy with the results @GiftedGinger has helped me achieve
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-02 09:44:34	Watching and listening to traffic go by as the sun rises is part relaxing, part super depressing. Mostly because I'm awake to do it.
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-02 12:56:39	I hate my boss; he's kind of a dick. I don't get paid nearly enough to put up with his shit
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-04 17:48:30	AAAAAAAHHHHHH WRESTLING AAAAAAAHHHHHH.

But seriously, it's only been the longest 3 rounds.
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-04 21:55:13	Just lost where I was... on I69... between Indy and my house. How often have I driven this stretch? At least once a week the past 8 years
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-03 20:25:05	Everyone else is all "happy workday" and I'm just driving around and helping set up a tournament
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-08 17:33:25	Who knew an on-bus dvd player could be so difficult to figure out...
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-08 22:44:49	Redbox stop on the way to York!
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-09 00:24:57	I wish I would've brought my notebook along to write some more. Poor planning on my part.
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-09 00:58:44	Under a mountain, I get full signal, yet struggle to get it right before and right after the tunnel #whut
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-10 22:24:20	Fuuuuck that was bad
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-12 17:03:53	@courtney_gray_ COURTNEY WHY ARE YOU AWAKE?
707588191	willbnicely	2015-06-13 21:41:03	What do you call 9 black cows staring at a white goat laying in the grass?

Pennsylvania TV apparently.
