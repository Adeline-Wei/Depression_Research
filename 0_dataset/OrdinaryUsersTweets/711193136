711193136	MeetIvy	2013-12-05 02:07:20	If success was easy, all of my tears &amp; hardworking wouldn't mean anything. And God wouldn't get all the glory &amp; praise in the end. 😇
711193136	MeetIvy	2013-11-30 15:42:21	Had a dream that I got married in the ex's suit that I was going to buy him. What does that mean? I'm so confused.
