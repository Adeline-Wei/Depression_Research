71377222	iHail21	2013-11-30 23:57:15	Wow! Stopped them.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-01 00:02:13	That close‚Ä¶.wow!
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-01 00:09:12	Lol! Someone hide Foster from Saban.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-01 00:13:48	Lets go Auburn!
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-01 00:25:42	WOW!!!!!! WTF JUST HAPPENED????
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-01 00:30:14	Yes. RT @MockingTheDraft: New storyline: Does Auburn jump Ohio State in the BCS?
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-01 00:33:18	@MrDCsports @06Troop21 you gotta think Auburn moves to # 2 after beating the # 1 team.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-01 00:37:10	@MrDCsports @06Troop21 true but this is the NCAAF where a lot of weird things have happened in the past.
71377222	iHail21	2013-11-30 20:36:20	Terrible throw and decision by Gardner. What a hell of a drive though.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-01 00:26:08	Speechless right now. Wow!
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-01 00:27:37	That 1 second just cost Bama the game. Lol!!
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-01 00:30:00	FSU vs Auburn BCS Championship game as long Auburn wins the SEC Championship. Sorry Ohio State, but you‚Äôre can‚Äôt compare.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-02 01:24:05	Why are people acting like that they never seen the stadium this empty in their life? The team sucks and this not a great sports town.

71377222	iHail21	2013-12-02 01:42:30	@Sean_Bishop well, hopefully someone can confirm that.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-02 01:45:52	Rak, is that you?
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-09 16:25:59	@HTTR24_7 you know that's not accurate.  Shanny's results suck, but wasn't a complete failure.  Gave team the right direction.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 15:32:03	Shocking that Snyder is still empowering certain star players, not! Part of the issue for the franchise. It‚Äôll never change.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 15:38:18	Are you really? This is nothing new for this franchise. It‚Äôll never change.  Regardles... (cont) http://t.co/9kDGz0X7j5
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 15:40:32	@freshxdesign @Redskins yup. And it‚Äôll never change. Which coach can ever win under him? So far none have and probably nobody will.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 15:42:06	I love RG3‚Äôs potential and everything but he has come across as a spoiled brat since end of last season and throughout this season.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 15:45:03	@freshxdesign @Redskins exactly. This is BS! Pisses me off that I will probably never see a championship team in my whole lifetime.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 15:45:57	@freshxdesign @Redskins who the hell would want to coach under these circumstances? This is a temporary NFL gig. It is run by clowns.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 15:51:14	Continuously hiring and firing coaches doesn‚Äôt fix anything. Look at the team‚Äôs history for past 14 years since Dan has owned the team!
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 15:52:08	Yet some of y‚Äôall are going to give Dan a pass on this and blame everything on Shanny cause of your love for RG3. Good plan!
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 15:53:35	@B_in_DC I know but focusing on times since Snyder has been here.

71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 16:02:38	So badly want a successful franchise without all of this drama. It doesn‚Äôt matter who the coach here is and the star players. Same BS!
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 16:09:22	@MaineUPTDC yup and this history doesn‚Äôt help either. This is not a top NFL job regardless of the team having a potential franchise QB.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 16:10:13	@freshxdesign agreed 100%. Will it ever happen? I doubt it.

71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 19:11:05	I wonder how many people will be there after half time.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 19:12:11	Chiefs will have 50 points before the half.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 19:29:38	All of the fans should go home at half time. I want an empty stadium!

71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 20:26:52	Nice tackling, again!
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 21:07:47	Honestly, can anybody really be pissed or surprised by Skins performance today? All kidding aside.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 21:14:59	Nope. RT @AndrewSiciliano: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 21:20:01	So he didn‚Äôt commit to starting RG3 next week. Wow!

71377222	iHail21	2013-12-08 19:02:49	31-0. Still 9:45 to go in the first half‚Ä¶.

71377222	iHail21	2013-12-15 19:36:04	They wasted about 10 secs before taking the previous timeout. Nice job everybody.
71377222	iHail21	2013-12-15 19:37:28	They could‚Äôve taken a shot in the endzone if they properly knew how to manage time but they haven‚Äôt done so in 4 years.

71377222	iHail21	2014-01-04 17:23:57	If RG3 met with a potential HC, it would be WWIII. Yet, no issue with Stafford meeting with Caldwell. Cool.
71377222	iHail21	2014-01-04 17:44:02	CR and his sources! lmao!! What a troll! Still waiting for Bill Cowher.
71377222	iHail21	2014-01-03 22:50:20	Can we please get Ray Horton to the Skins as the DC when the new HC is hired? Please!

71377222	iHail21	2014-01-05 20:43:37	@MrDCsports lol! I know. Love the reactions on twitter. All of these potential head coaches are bums now after this weekend. Shaw included.
71377222	iHail21	2014-01-05 20:45:27	@TMM75 @MrDCsports yes! He forced Dalton to dive head first and fumble. RG3 wanted to see a replay of his own fumble in the playoffs.
71377222	iHail21	2014-01-05 21:05:26	Just over three hours ago, Jay was an exciting HC possibility and now he is the worst coach in the world. Lol!
71377222	iHail21	2014-01-05 21:07:30	@JTPartlow21 @MrDCsports that includes Shaw, Briles, Jay, and Zim. Who else am I missing? Nobody is good enough to coach the Skins anymore.

71377222	iHail21	2014-01-04 16:59:27	@evansilva @AdamSchefter that's his opinion. He was a Shanny guy and a backup QB who wants a chance to start.

71377222	iHail21	2014-01-25 16:04:05	@TER4M the reflection of the dock via classic dock tweak. Not sure if you're familiar with it.
71377222	iHail21	2014-01-25 16:08:50	@bAdziggy7 @TER4M really? That's weird. Did change or rename anything?

71377222	iHail21	2014-09-21 19:55:40	Payback for Cousins
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-21 19:57:11	What about Peters?!!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-21 19:57:21	Complete bullshit!!!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-21 19:57:42	Makes complete f‚Äôen sense. RT @JTPartlow21: YOU EJECT TRENT BUT NOT PETERS?
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-21 19:59:57	Bullshit corrupt fucking league. @nfl
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-21 20:01:35	Bring Trent back
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-21 20:04:27	Another bs call
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-23 12:33:24	@MxthieuEst7 @smitbeat64 @frenchitouch it‚Äôs no longer part of elite7 package. Are u able to share it?
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-23 15:38:04	@frenchitouch liking this theme. Good work. http://t.co/StQhQJSWXa
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-23 17:18:03	@MxthieuEst7 thank you. Really appreciate it.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 01:05:44	Is anybody really surprised by this performance? This is typical.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 01:13:33	Dirt came up when the left toes hit the ground. But we all know how this is going to go.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 01:19:39	Why call that for the Skins? RT @NQS88: A hit out of bounds.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 01:21:45	Roberts anybody?
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 01:36:46	This is pathetic.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 01:40:40	You know what, fuck this. I‚Äôm blaming RG3 for how shitty the team is playing tonight. All your fault Griff!
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 01:41:49	@TMM75 should‚Äôve never been franchised. However he is too important to let go.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 01:44:04	Cousins just got Niles hammered!
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 01:45:14	Kid got sandwiched. Hope he‚Äôs ok.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 01:53:24	Hey has anybody seen 98 on the field today? I only saw him on the sideline apologizing. Was he apologizing for being so shitty?
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 01:54:28	we saw it all last season RT @richeisen: This is as bad a defensive first half I‚Äôve seen in sometime. And I watched a 56-0 game last week.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 01:56:40	Lol so fucking embarrassing.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 01:58:22	Guess I‚Äôm going to bed early. Same shit just a different year.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 01:59:55	Looks that way. Hey but at least we beat the Jags! RT @JoeGibbsIsGod: Skins will be 1-5
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:00:39	4th rank defense. Lol. Fools gold people. All stats compiled against jags and texans.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:01:21	THE FUCK?! RT @DBLAZE1119: @dcsportsbog He‚Äôs back!!! http://t.co/v6QIWx1XC8
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:03:15	See somehow after this game most fans will still be debating Cousins vs Griff. Who cares about rest of the issues?
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:14:59	That‚Äôs exactly what the O needed.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:15:22	Crap. The defense now comes back on the field doesn‚Äôt it. Sigh‚Ä¶..
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:15:54	Best LT in the game. RT @MrDCsportsSr: Trent Williams cleared two men out the way.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:17:09	@MrDCsportsSr the dumb personal fouls. Agreed. Only thing holding him back. Respect the C on the chest.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:20:07	Breeland got benched, huh?
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:32:34	That will be overturned to Giants TD. The usual.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:34:33	Lol hey look something for once went in our favor.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:35:48	DAMN YOU GRIFF!!!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:38:35	Lol! Goodnight all.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:40:01	He‚Äôs the future! RT @HTTR24_7: Colt McCoy?
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:47:13	But he‚Äôs the future, Kevin! Stick by him, you. RT @kevins980: #8 is rattled.  Bout to get even uglier.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:48:26	Yikes. That was ugly attempt by Clark.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:48:53	DC. No place like it. RT @richeisen: Four days ago: what will they do when @RGIII comes back? Four days later: when is @RGIII coming back?
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:53:57	Hopefully Griff is being careful with his foot doing all the backflips.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 02:55:48	Nah bro. He‚Äôs the future RT @BouBaBonics: ‚Äú@thomloverro: Maybe it‚Äôs just the ‚Äù8‚Ä≥ jersey #Redskins‚Äù maybe he‚Äôs just a backup &amp; nothing else.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-27 01:00:31	Here we go. RIP21.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-27 01:09:06	Getting goosebumps already.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-27 01:09:25	This! - RT @Boog21: Watching this Sean Taylor special alone in my room bc there is a 100% chance of tears #HTTR
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-27 01:18:02	FUCK WILBON AND COWHERD!! You two fucking clowns. We‚Äôll never forgot the shit you two talked about when Sean was shot. Will never forget!
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-27 01:27:42	@B_in_DC nah. Just fully remember the crap they said. Word by word.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-27 01:42:35	Taylor‚Äôs jersey was the only jersey I ever bought with my own money. Will most likely never be able to rock another jersey. Fact.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-27 01:50:53	This is fucking tough. Damn. RIP21. Forever loved. Never forgotten.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-27 01:53:00	I don‚Äôt think another player will ever replace Sean or come close to him as my favorite player. Ever.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-26 12:40:35	JReid is a fucking troll. We all know this then why give a fuck what he says?
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-30 20:12:36	@AlTalbot way too many glitches this year.  Kind of disappointed with Fifa 15 to be honest.  Expected a lot better.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-28 19:43:30	What a great day For Nats‚Äô fan. Incredible.
71377222	iHail21	2014-09-28 20:19:35	Oh shit Tampa
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-01 12:34:30	It‚Äôs not even close. RT @HTTR24_7: Wall &amp; Beal &gt; Kyrie &amp; Waiters
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-02 22:13:46	@SonofWashington that‚Äôs sweet. Can you do one with either just the R or the logo in the middle?
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-04 20:26:45	Damn that was nasty looking. Screaming like crazy. Yikes.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-04 20:27:19	Obvious dislocated ankle if not more for Bell.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-04 20:29:19	Sorry meant Drake not Bell.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-05 02:39:30	Shitty sports down. No wonder people make fun of the fans here. RT @MaineUPTDC: Fans leaving the game smh
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-06 23:04:24	Long overdue for Nats
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-06 23:50:24	Some of you idiot fans are really booing Griff? No wonder people make fun of the fans of this town. F‚Äôen clowns!
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-06 23:57:38	Nicely done Nats
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-07 00:36:43	No idea what type of defense we played on that series. Then again no idea why Haslett is still the d coordinator. Should‚Äôve been fired.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-07 00:38:23	Definitely we are one of the worst teams in the league if not the worst. We are the Raiders of the east.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-07 00:39:14	I wonder what Wade Phillips is up to.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-07 00:39:47	This is the continuation of week ago Thursday.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-07 00:41:11	@B_in_DC yeah but still stupid to bring him back. Results spoke for themselves. Oh wait it was all Shannys fault.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-07 00:49:36	This is just sad.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-07 00:50:02	Seattle just keeps running the same play.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-07 01:31:44	Miss those days when everything was Griff‚Äôs fault and Cousins was a future HOFer‚Ä¶.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-07 01:38:17	Or the whole game. RT @CHICKatCSN: No containment at all on that series!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-07 01:42:32	Finally something
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-07 02:17:40	So Mcshay is calling the plays huh?
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-07 02:18:09	Yup Mcshay is.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-07 02:19:12	@StricknineSkinz been like that forever here now. Home or away.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-07 02:20:15	Meant McVay obviously not Mcshay.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-07 02:27:21	@Chaosbandit haha only on an interim basis.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-08 23:57:19	Damn JReid got clownfed Clark. About time.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-09 00:24:35	Shocking. RT @JsteelznSkinz: BB doesnt know what he is talking about ether.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-09 12:35:15	I honestly don‚Äôt give 2 fucks about wapo,  it‚Äôs columnists and beat reporters. All biased bs anyways. They‚Äôre not gonna stop their bs.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-12 21:02:19	So one of the Skins fans said on Twitter the other day that we overpaid for Jax. Go back and look at past two games.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-12 23:00:12	Wow. No words. Pretty clear he was down.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-12 23:03:15	Yup Rak. Perfect.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-12 23:13:42	So what is Cousins record as a starter now? Where his fan club at? I remember Keil comparing him to Luck.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-12 23:16:22	Kick is Rex 2.0 at best. Fucking idiots were anointing him the permanent QB going forward. GTFOH!
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-12 23:18:06	This team lacks talent at the key spots. Has been the case for years. Need a real GM. That‚Äôs never gonna happen.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-12 23:25:17	Hey look another pick. Who would‚Äôve thunk it.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-12 23:25:52	Yup and we‚Äôll fuck it up. RT @recordsANDradio: gonna have a decent first round draft pick tho!
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-12 23:26:34	LMFAO! RT @Russellmania980: And that‚Äôs your ballgame‚Ä¶See ya later Arizona. Only one team that was 1-5 has ever made playoffs. 1970 #Bengals.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-12 18:01:57	Remember how ‚Äúshitty‚Äù Kyle was as an OC and only got jobs cause of his dad? Yeah he‚Äôs cooking in Cleveland.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-13 00:31:48	@B_in_DC Not coaching a problem.  How many coaches have come &amp; gone?  Same results at the end of the day.  Need more talent = need a real GM
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-13 00:32:32	@B_in_DC Haslett and Raheem should've been gone.  They weren't let go to save money.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-13 00:33:50	@freshxdesign @JsteelznSkinz same crap 4 years.  Need more football people in the organization.  Front office needs to be overhauled.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-13 00:36:10	For the record I like Jay and believe he can get the job done.  Need to give him proper resources and time.  Needs a real GM badly!
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-13 00:42:25	Does anybody make more excuses than Rak? Dude, GTFOH! You're hot garbage who is well overpaid!
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-13 12:24:43	Tune in to sports radio this morning and people including the hosts are Jay is one and done. This town is fucking joke.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-13 01:34:38	@freshxdesign @Theismann7 preseason = overrated.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-13 15:44:15	@vjdennis77 @djetouch nice HS wall. Can you share?
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-13 15:51:26	@vjdennis77 got it. Thanks.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-14 14:21:21	@TMM75 sad part is that the team will do completely opposite of what makes sense.  Track record speaks for itself.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-14 10:43:52	Idiotic - RT @SportsTalk570: Any chance of a one &amp; done season for Gruden &amp; the #Redskins? What‚Äôs your take? It‚Äôs @andypollin1
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-13 21:47:17	@ajitbtw @frenchitouch nice icono. Can you share? Thanks.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-19 21:50:05	Yo why is Grant so salty about Griff? It‚Äôs laughable.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-16 17:29:59	@StrickSkin @AKM_ES @MrDCsportsSr F the home crowd. Fans were booing him when he was there before the SEA game.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-20 14:14:21	@AKM_ES you're not alone. Makes no sense at all.  Kid has so much talent.  Needs to stay healthy &amp; be given the opportunity to grow.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-19 17:12:11	Not a catch.  should be overturned.  But fucking tired of same players fuckin up over and over again.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-19 20:08:51	Yay win
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-21 19:36:08	@B_in_DC @MrDCsportsSr - actually one of the Skins fan in my office said that shit yesterday.  "Keep him healthy for next year"
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-19 20:10:43	Championship! RT @JoeGibbsIsGod: 2-5!!!!!!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-27 02:21:55	Lol people doing selective tweeting with Fletcher.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 00:48:55	Nice defensive stops
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 00:54:38	Fuck this league man
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 00:55:11	Thank you!
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 00:56:30	Can we please hurry it up? Morris can‚Äôt see the damn holes. Slow. RT @JsteelznSkinz: Countdown to seeing Silas

71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 00:59:36	Lmao! Yup
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 00:59:54	Gotta capitalize here. Need a TD.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:01:03	He threw up a duck
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:02:00	Did he maintain possession through the INT though? Should be reviewed by the refs.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:11:12	LMAO!! Murray!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:12:05	Breeland‚Äôs ballin right now
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:12:44	Yep RT @Callahan_9: Perry Riley sucks but thanks to him sucking Murray fumbled after him sucking.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:15:12	Big play makes me happy
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:15:33	Should‚Äôve been a TD though if he led him a bit more
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:15:59	Or throws an INT. RT @Callahan_9: McCoy‚Äôs lack of arm costs us 7. Cousins makes that throw.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:18:17	One step forward and two steps backwards
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:32:34	Oh boy
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:32:52	Fumble? RT @MikeJonesWaPo: Silas Redd gets into the game with a carry. What can the young fella do?
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:34:45	@freshxdesign Compton in there at RT. Why not have Josh or Long play too?
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:35:58	Yay‚Ä¶can please do something positive now?
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:36:43	@freshxdesign not very. Gotta give the youngs a shot at some point. Not gonna happen though.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:36:59	We love fumbling. That‚Äôs for sure.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:41:34	Roberts keeps dropping catches
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:43:01	Young offensive line??
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:44:19	@freshxdesign no idea what‚Äôs he has been talking about. Earlier called Rak our best pass rusher.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:46:54	No pass rush. Been like this for years now.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:48:02	Hey look we continue to play 10 yards off when they only need 5.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 01:50:02	Finally!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 02:06:04	Finally a positive play from Morris
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 02:13:55	Thank you! TD.

71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 02:26:00	Morris just can‚Äôt hold on to the ball anymore.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 02:31:50	BREELAND has been all over the place today.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 02:32:14	BREELAND
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 02:33:01	BREELAND stopped a TD three times on that drive. Started with running down Murray.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 02:41:19	Great throw
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 02:45:21	TOUCHDOWN!!!! Great call!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 02:56:41	No idea what the defensive gameplan on that drive was.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:07:57	FIRST DOWN!!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:13:42	Great punt‚Ä¶.now let‚Äôs see what happens.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:16:55	HOW THE FUCK DO YOU NOT HOLD ON TO IT?????
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:20:06	God damn it!!!!!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:20:28	Two fucking plays now.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:23:31	Haha fuck u Cowturds
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:30:30	Let‚Äôs go. First down.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:31:18	Morris has looked so much better after the half.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:32:27	Nice back shoulder.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:33:01	What a play!!!!!! Wow!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:35:51	Can‚Äôt breathe‚Ä¶.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:39:44	Positive play from Riley
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:40:31	Two positive plays from Riley
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:41:16	Seriously can‚Äôt breathe. Need to check pulse.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:42:28	GAME!!!!!!! Fuck you Cowturds!!!!!!!!!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:43:54	What a game and a win. Much needed.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:44:57	Team effort tonight. Beautiful. -tears up-
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:45:31	Great win for Jay. He will be a great coach as long as he has the right GM with him.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:46:38	Not going to sleep tonight. Fuck work.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:50:36	ESPN barely talked about the Skins before this game. All about the boys. Fuck the boys!!! Overrated franchise and fan base.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:52:25	Compton did a decent job at RT tonight. Need more young guys to receive chances to start.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:57:28	Stupid question to ask.  RT @ZacBoyer: Gruden: Griffin is the starter. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not going to change.‚Äù
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:58:45	Dianna from NBC is just stupid. Always trying to stirrup controversy.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 03:59:52	All the Cowturds fans in my office tomorrow getting the middle finger salute tomorrow.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 11:58:23	@ThaiCaliber haha getting texts from my team members as well. Nearly all calling out. Bitches.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 16:31:18	Just stupid RT @NBCdianna: Colt has now won 2 games for the Redskins. Let‚Äôs say RG3 is healthy to return after the bye. Who would you start?
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 16:40:17	@B_in_DC @NBCdianna @MWharam7 same idiots were proclaiming Kirk to be the franchise QB after Philly and Skins lost that game. C‚Äômon now.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 16:52:40	@B_in_DC @MrDCsportsSr haha. She annoys me so much. Normally ignore her but that was just a stupid tweet.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 00:35:09	Finally a decent return this season.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-28 00:35:39	Kid got hammered. RT @freshxdesign: Did you see that block wow
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-29 15:26:22	@iDeviceWall the link just takes u to the main photostream page. Can you please confirm the link? Thanks.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-29 20:51:04	Lmao at Dianna. She‚Äôs gonna lose her shit since she is reporting Griff gonna start.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-29 21:08:44	Yup very honest and on point. RT @freshxdesign: Jay Gruden has had the best presser‚Äôs since I‚Äôve been a fan
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-30 18:16:47	@JsteelznSkinz follow back
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-30 21:36:06	Driver in a convict costume going through a sobriety test on route 7 west. Priceless.
71377222	iHail21	2014-10-31 17:45:08	@MrDCsportsSr he's a straight clown.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-01 00:32:48	If you look 12 plus and are boys, I‚Äôm not giving you candy. Don‚Äôt give a fuck about ya‚Äôll.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 14:11:45	Only in this town a kid like RG3 has been turned into a villain. Intelligent kid who gives everything he has 4 the team. Yet da bs continues
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 14:25:59	Brit‚Äôs sources: Moss, Gar√ßon &amp; Kirk? That has to be it, right? You are 3-5 on the season. no reason to bitch about da best QB on the roster.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 14:30:17	The hate makes no sense at all. RT @freshxdesign: @B_in_DC for someone who plays so hard it‚Äôs hard to believe he so negative
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 14:36:10	@B_in_DC but you know it‚Äôs all Griffs fault. He somehow caused the accident.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 14:38:03	Haha. RT @B_in_DC: @iHail21 the driver was so distracted by Griffins poor leadership.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 15:07:04	@Marcel703 @HitchensSKINS @ESPNNFL all bs. Reporters who were in the locker room confirm the screaming &amp; yelling was about something else.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 15:42:21	@ESPNNFL @BramESPN you should look at the reports from local reporters too. They are saying the total opposite of this bs story.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 15:44:43	@MrDCsportsSr it‚Äôs wild. All local media has challenged that report but people running with the ESPN report. Agenda driven to say the least.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 15:46:05	@MrDCsportsSr too many bitches in the organization as well. Major reason why this time has sucked for years.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 16:55:35	@Frohzin @ESPNNFL @BramESPN look at you jumping into other peoples mentions. Get the fuck out of here.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:10:47	GTIFFFFFFF!!!!! That‚Äôs all!!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:11:04	Kept his eyes up
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:12:34	Another first down. Great drive so far. Griff looks comfortable and in control.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:13:44	That was an awkward hit. Shit.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:14:51	My heart just jumped out my throat.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:19:04	Should‚Äôve been a penalty for below the knees hit on QB. RT @_JakeRussell: Ouch! http://t.co/FbWxYO9MFW
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:23:47	No pressure at all without blitzing. Ugh.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:24:43	Murphy good job there.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:28:25	Nice play! No penalty there though??
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:32:27	Morris looks like a completely different running since halftime in Dallas last week. Very good.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:35:37	Fucking Roberts. Sick of his drops. Low throw but should‚Äôve been caught.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:37:04	Home run!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:39:14	Yeah. He looks very rusty. We want Kirk! RT @MrDCsportsSr: Should‚Äôve rested RGIII until after the bye.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:42:23	Breeland
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:43:47	Keenan with a nice tackle.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:44:20	Kerrigan got tackled down
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:45:25	Field position
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:49:19	Griff
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:51:13	Haha Griff got em
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:52:24	Helu should‚Äôve cut back
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 18:56:39	Breeland the best player on D? He‚Äôs been playing like one over the past two weeks.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 19:02:22	Roberts is going to get blasted one of these. Doesn‚Äôt know what a fair catch is.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 19:04:48	Damn u Morris. Griff keeping his eyes up. Nicely done dot far.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 19:06:04	Gar√ßon yeah keep bitching instead of making plays.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 19:10:52	That‚Äôs an INT.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 19:11:28	Jay‚Äôs gotta win a challenge one of these days right?
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 19:14:25	This league is so inconsistent.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 19:26:56	This D-line is pathetic. No pressure at all.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 19:27:50	That was easy. No pressure and Clark got beat.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:05:16	Home run!!! 10 to 11 all day!
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:07:42	That‚Äôs exactly the type of response you were looking for from this team after giving up 14 unanswered points.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:14:39	Need another touchdown here
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:16:50	Good job Griff
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:18:45	Lol pulled Trent all the way to the other side
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:19:51	Huge first down there. Nice run helu.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:23:58	Need a turnover badly
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:26:42	No pressure at all. Ugh this D-line.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:27:21	This defense needs to man up
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:31:59	Teddy has all day back there. Embarrassing.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:32:13	Fuck this defense and Haz. Same shit as before.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:37:49	Beautiful throw and catch. -tears up-
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:41:36	Griff doing a nice job in the pocket too.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:41:52	Dirty fucking play.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:42:09	Home run bitches!!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:42:25	Have to go for two there
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:46:45	Defense gotta step up. Offense has done what it has needed to so far.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:51:46	No pressure at all. Pathetic.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:56:07	This defense should be embarrassed.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 20:59:34	Have Viking punted at all in the second half? They‚Äôve scored on almost all of their drives.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 21:09:24	Griff missed him.  Fuck.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 21:15:05	Yep. Are blinded by their hate. RT @NQS88: Convinced some fans want Griffin to fail.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 21:27:43	Oh shit Jay went there. Lol
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-02 21:28:02	Small time reporter. Lol
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-03 15:23:03	@STX21 you're having the standby issue as well?
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-03 16:17:23	@MrDCsportsSr @TMM75 and just look at Wise's column. @recordsANDradio has been tweeting about it this morning.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-03 17:13:56	Wow Thom really pushing Colt over Griff. I‚Äôm done.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-03 17:21:11	@TMM75 in so many words that Colt would‚Äôve out played Griff yesterday. Also Griffs 5 sacks equal 3 turnovers from Cousins.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-03 17:27:18	@TMM75 completely agree with u there. Griff made loads of mistakes yesterday but showed progress. Have to find out if he is the long term QB
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-04 16:01:55	@MrDCsportsSr always.  He is not allowed to talk at all.  He should just stay mute even what he says is the right thing.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-04 16:03:24	@MrDCsportsSr then people will bitch as to why he is being selfish &amp; getting fined. Kid can't win off the field.  He just needs to win games
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-09 21:15:58	Perish Cox should get an Oscar for that performance.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-13 01:22:17	He should just shut up. RT @Rich_TandlerCSN: RT @JPFinlayCSN: Joe Theismann on #Redskins RG3,‚Äúshould‚Äôve never started against Minnesota.‚Äù
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-13 01:23:48	God Joey T is f‚Äôing annoying.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-17 20:27:13	@SportingParagon hopefully he is given the chance with the right supporting cast in the FO.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-17 21:46:20	PR 101....something the Skins organization along with the players really suck at!
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-17 21:49:37	LMAO!!! All of this Skins drama is too funny.  Should be a TV show.  Can't make it up.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-16 19:13:07	So glad I will be in UK over the next two weeks and not have to witness this dumpster fire.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-16 19:23:37	It always seems Dick Stockton is two plays behind
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-16 19:26:30	Whoa a positive drive O_o
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-16 20:24:51	LMFAO!!!!!!!!!!!
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-16 20:26:25	Skins fans should boycott all games until FO is fixed. That‚Äôll never happen.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-16 20:29:33	@nomorevinny @MarkBullockNFL how many more coaches are the Skins going To fire? Issue clearly bigger than coaches. Nobody succeeds here.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-16 20:35:23	Some people here will blame everybody before they ever point the finger to Griff. Boy is struggling to say the least.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-16 20:49:43	Oline is part of the issues for Griff but his decision making and lack of pocket presence is very concerning to say the least.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-16 22:12:07	Well he still sucks. So does Griff at this time. Your point? RT @rickoharrison: Where are all the ‚ÄúKirk Cousins Sucks!!‚Äù people now?
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-16 22:18:23	@steve4skins @rickoharrison fair enough. we‚Äôve been looking horrible years. Issue way bigger than one damn player.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-21 18:50:48	No issues what Jay said about Griff. It‚Äôs the truth.
71377222	iHail21	2014-11-20 12:41:50	Why don‚Äôt you at him, EB? RT @B_in_DC: ‚Äú@EBJunkies: Its over Johnny http://t.co/vgANo1wyrU‚Äù @awfulannouncing

71377222	iHail21	2014-12-07 20:08:34	So Griff was the only issue right??? Lol

71377222	iHail21	2014-12-07 20:35:59	It looks like the team has completely quit on Jay

71377222	iHail21	2014-12-07 19:18:57	Sooo can we get Griff in the second half?
71377222	iHail21	2014-12-07 19:19:36	Oh wait forgot we can‚Äôt cause he is the root of all the issues.

71377222	iHail21	2014-12-11 17:31:39	@AKM_ES I'm in the exact same position.  The past few week's have been very troubling.  Need a strong minded coach who can be political.
71377222	iHail21	2014-12-11 17:45:52	@NQS88 just 42 points? You're being generous now.

71377222	iHail21	2014-12-16 20:30:40	Doesn't matter if Griff is back next year or not.  You just can't have Jay back, period.  Dude is over his head.  He's an embarrassment.

71377222	iHail21	2014-12-28 21:10:26	@Russellmania980 why? Dan isn‚Äôt going to hold him accountable. Same shit next year with possibly AJ in the mix. Same old crap.

71377222	iHail21	2014-12-28 23:16:54	@B_in_DC I hear ya. Need someone who can build team properly and keep the media along with the fan base at bay.  Manage relationships better

71377222	iHail21	2015-04-03 14:06:49	Just fews weeks ago, Skins had no starting caliber safeties.  Scott has been adding quality.
71377222	iHail21	2015-04-15 01:30:22	Well that was close. Damn.
71377222	iHail21	2015-04-18 18:48:52	Oh my Beal!

71377222	iHail21	2015-05-02 01:44:57	I‚Äôm tearing up right now at the fact we have a competent GM running this draft. Been too too long
71377222	iHail21	2015-05-01 00:05:59	Skins finally have a qualified GM yet Skins fans up here panicking and acting like bitches already. GTFOH!
71377222	iHail21	2015-05-01 00:31:36	OMG WILLIAMS IS THERE FOR THE SKINS! Best player in the draft! Let‚Äôs see what Scott does.
71377222	iHail21	2015-05-01 00:38:31	Oh my. Would‚Äôve liked Williams.
71377222	iHail21	2015-05-01 00:40:05	I mean you leave the best player on the board. To go fill a need but still you leave Williams. Interesting.
71377222	iHail21	2015-05-01 00:52:57	@MaineUPTDC @DCSportsNStuff fans just stupid.
71377222	iHail21	2015-05-01 00:58:43	Skins fans need to go back and watch games from last year where the guards were continuously getting destroyed. Same with RT.
71377222	iHail21	2015-05-01 01:04:39	@MrDCsportsSr somehow Skins fans will. Always find things to complain about.
71377222	iHail21	2015-05-01 01:06:25	@MrDCsportsSr the reaction the pick is hilarious. People here complained how horrible the OL is and how we never draft OL in the 1st round.
71377222	iHail21	2015-05-02 12:07:46	@JTPartlowDraft @Redskins tweets recently have greatly improved and more entertaining. Nice change.

71377222	iHail21	2015-05-21 00:00:59	Yup. now his &amp; Harper‚Äôs relationship seems very strong.  RT @MrDCsportsSr: Matt Williams has grown on me. Love how he protects his players.
71377222	iHail21	2015-05-21 00:02:59	@MrDCsportsSr yeah it was. You can clearly see Harper growing under Matt. Has taken on bit of his personality as well.
71377222	iHail21	2015-05-19 23:20:03	Number 15. Harper. That is all.
71377222	iHail21	2015-05-19 23:20:41	Still think the kid is overrated???

71377222	iHail21	2015-05-22 23:37:32	Hey look another HR for Harper. Yawns
71377222	iHail21	2015-05-29 23:36:59	Damn Stras. Feel for the kid.
71377222	iHail21	2015-05-30 21:43:41	@B_in_DC it‚Äôs disgusting on so many levels. I‚Äôm a Muslim who grew up with both Jew and Christian friends and never felt unwelcomed.
71377222	iHail21	2015-05-30 21:45:34	I‚Äôm a proud Muslim American. This is my country as much as the nexts. If you don‚Äôt like, you can go Fuck yourselves. That is all.

71377222	iHail21	2015-05-30 22:09:38	@gutlead74 @B_in_DC well I took that as what‚Äôs happening in AZ is not America.

71377222	iHail21	2015-06-15 02:29:24	@JuiceAtomic yup I can see that happen too. Just will not believe that he is really dead. He will return in some form.
71377222	iHail21	2015-06-17 03:46:07	So, Lebron‚Ä¶what about the guarantee?? Folded again in the clutch situation. Nobody there to bail him out this time around.
71377222	iHail21	2015-06-18 11:14:13	@idRidge @djetouch nice setup. What‚Äôs the name of the dock that you‚Äôre using?
