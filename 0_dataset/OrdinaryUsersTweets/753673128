753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-04-18 13:22:01	I need a serious dose of fuck it all
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-04-18 13:22:31	It's all shits and giggles until somebody giggles and shits
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-04-18 02:07:50	Headaches were the worst creation every exposed to human kind.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-04-18 18:55:08	Huntsville bound!!

753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-04-21 02:35:13	@kin_hunter just saying. But when you finally fond that guy....he might be a little gay. Think about it. Men ain't supposed to be flexible!

753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-04-21 02:38:44	I asked my dad if he was questioning my methods...he said I have no methods...
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-04-21 02:50:54	Gotta say. Happiness isn't always perfect, but if you work on it, its pretty dang close, and it makes all the things in the end worth it.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-04-20 04:22:53	Hate it when heart beat rises so high you can't breathe. You cry for help and your mom comes in only to pick you up off the floor.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-04-20 04:23:48	Your body shakes and trembles. You can't breathe. You have a panic attack. Everything goes dark and you find yourself crying on her shoulder
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-04-23 02:20:11	One thing I successfully learned during high school. teachers make us "learn" but really only kill us through stress faster.

753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-05-12 03:08:26	Now are the moments where we are truly tested on patience...but mine is starting to run thin on many people.

753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-05-16 05:41:03	San Antone. Beautiful. Amazing. Breath taking. But this garbage...it just ruins the moment😒😕
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-05-22 03:04:45	You can dream but the only way to achieve them is by turning them into goals and striving to meet them.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-05-25 05:19:37	I'm tired of running around in circles. Trying to change the way you feel. And I'm tired of being broken. Trying to figure out if we're real
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-05-25 05:33:45	You know what. Just gonna sit back, pop a tab, and relax, cause I'm done with this shit and I really don't need anymore in my life.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-05-26 01:37:04	Play times over. Tomorrow is a long day of work.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-05-26 19:57:33	God bless the men and women fighting over seas to keep us free! Remember those who have fallen and the reason we are still Americans today!

753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-08-06 01:47:08	Here is a tip on careers and success. Don't post anything on social media for your scholarships, colleges, or future employers to see.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-08-06 01:48:40	In other words, don't post junk, post something to help you or others. Whatever you post is on the internet, forever. Be careful why you do.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-08-06 02:06:36	Early night in bed? I think so👍
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-08-10 21:29:15	Don't start stuff you can't finish. Either walk the walk, or don't talk to talk. Though with your little drama game.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-08-11 03:40:13	Watching Urban Legends: Bloody Mary, um yea...I hate spiders now...thanks

753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-08-11 07:41:15	The things we say and the things we do make us our own monsters. We are the ones that destroy a fate in humanity not just our own fates.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-08-13 22:27:10	Gotta love being able to sit in the shade with a nice breeze blowing. Perfection of the world.

753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-10-18 01:36:38	One patch of hay left to bale. Then it's a fun filled weekend with my cowgirl and family😘😘😘
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-10-16 15:02:15	Just 2 more nights, then it's the last bailing of hay for the year and an afternoon to spend with her😊
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-10-17 00:58:39	I swear, if you were my kid, I'd have already beat the living hell out of you. You would have saw Jesus and would be like a little angel.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-10-17 02:05:50	I'm sorry darlin. You're my whole world and the keeper of my heart. Please forgive me😘
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-10-19 17:03:11	Fools! Don'tcha know that the best kind of girl is a cowgirl?!

753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-11-01 04:23:39	It's amazing how much she completes me. Never more than just a small conversation sparked a roaring flame that can't be burnt out.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-11-06 05:59:41	Just looked at a 101 slide power point for 2 hours....really hate nights before exams...😒

753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-11-20 06:20:15	When you are perfectly good and asleep and all the sudden, you wake up!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-11-19 03:23:52	Blame it on Texas, don't blame it on me!🎧
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-11-22 04:13:03	I'm just looking for a forever, in one more last first dance.🎤🎸

753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-11-28 04:43:39	Every day with you is a day I will cherish forever darlin😊😊😊
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-11-30 02:51:31	It's hardly past thanksgiving and me and my mom are putting up Christmas decorations😰
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-11-29 04:50:28	Every day with you feels like the day we first met😊
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-12-01 01:18:34	😩 really really wanting to get a new truck
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-12-03 00:37:38	Every little thing that you do, baby I'm amazed by you☺️☺️☺️

753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-12-03 04:33:46	When the stars are out I'm reminded of you. On that Texas night under the big full moon 🎤🎸
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-12-03 22:17:45	What can you say, when you're proud of your girl, you're proud for your girl. Congrats on getting accepted to SHSU babe!!!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-12-04 04:10:00	In about 18 days I will officially be 19....idk how to feel about this....there are only 2 years that matter...18 and 21!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-12-11 13:53:51	Foundations of Science final😑 the name of the course is nowhere near true to what the course really is I swear😑😑😑😑
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-12-11 04:08:14	I will officially end my first semester of college tomorrow. Time flew by way too fast. Next semester I will have to step up more.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-12-17 03:58:14	Well that escalated quickly😑
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-12-17 04:01:33	Because she understands what a real truck is!! #dodgenation
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-12-19 21:07:49	Tire blew out on truck. Won't be till Monday to get it changed😩 how great is that??
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-12-28 05:38:31	I'm missin you😩
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-12-29 03:04:04	To the person who just called without introducing themselves and blocking their number, do not waste my time again!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-12-30 17:09:42	I guess that's something you don't understand🎶
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-12-31 00:56:49	I'm counting the months till I get my next truck😊
753673128	_ethanlane_	2014-12-31 03:26:15	Having someone who can stand your family and all its chaos is probably the most amazing thing ever!!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-01 21:34:23	Never thought I'd be ready to be back at Sam, but truth is, I'm ready to get outta the house again.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-01 21:35:57	@kaybayy_14 you have no idea. Just walking into this house puts a stress on me
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-01 21:37:03	@kaybayy_14 yes. Plus I have my own thoughts and don't have to hear other people's opinions about how I live my life
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-01 22:33:00	@kaybayy_14 me too!! I'm ready to get it started!! Gotta get my GPA up. I barely made a 2.5!😖
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-05 21:05:49	Well, looks like even though my truck isn't completely fixed to be road worthy, my dad offered me to fix the green Chevy for me to drive.😁
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-04 05:58:46	I see the look in your eyes and I realize I ain't goin anywhere☺️
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-05 21:57:20	Please week, go by as SLOW as possible. Need enough time to make some money!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-05 23:17:27	Guess I just made things worse.😒
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-06 02:22:08	Today really just kinda sucked....😒
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-05 00:36:17	I find it odd that a family of Texans fans are sitting here at the table cheering for the Cowboys...
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-06 04:31:15	I'll hold the bottle, no, you hold the wheel🎧🎶
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-08 03:22:48	If I'm disrespectful towards you, generally means you disrespected me, my friends, family, or my girl. So you kinda sorta really deserved it
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-08 05:34:53	I hate that feeling where your thoughts get the best of you😒
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-08 05:35:21	And I hope and pray they are not true😔
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-10 05:52:38	Girls, don't place your numbers out to guys you don't know at a gas station. They my have a girlfriend and he'll just hand your # to her.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-11 04:22:28	If there is one person who understands me more than anyone, it would be her☺️☺️☺️☺️
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-13 00:48:39	Everyone wants to go to college far away. I understand and everything, but trust me, after the first semester you'd rather be close to home.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-16 03:03:19	She my angel my everything My one true love sent from God above Her smiles the best thing I've ever seen Lord thank you for givin her to me🎤
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-17 21:25:14	Really tired of this crap with my parents. Just get out of my life, you've ruined it enough!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-20 03:21:47	@Lynsey2015 it will all pay off darlin, I promise.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-20 03:30:40	Ok...now I'm starting to worry.....
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-20 04:11:21	@Randi_Mizell yes!!!!! I totally understand this!!!!!!!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-26 14:57:10	If you think about it.....this semester is gonna go by quick😐 better keep this staying ahead of everything going!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-28 03:15:13	Little girl, you're stepping into the most dangerous place you could be. Don't mess with my girl!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-01-29 04:28:07	When her smile means the most, it's something you'll do anything to see every day☺️
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-03 00:41:17	It's not about what you see on the outside that makes you fall for someone.  Make sure they can make you laugh, smile, and never stress.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-03 00:44:24	@kaybayy_14 I'm always alive!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-03 00:47:15	@kaybayy_14 yea, I've just been scrambling catching back up on my work!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-02 00:59:11	I'm so thankful for the past 5 months☺️ I'm glad I could find someone to put up with me!☺️
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-03 03:15:55	Really debating my major now 😁😁😁 #dodgenation #popo http://t.co/bWT6Va5Fk9
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-05 02:09:40	This English paper has got me brain locked😶
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-07 05:14:00	My dad records stuff off the history and discovery channel so I can watch em on the weekends. I am no doubt like my father😅
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-06 13:17:05	Time for another Friday
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-12 00:59:23	Been on a @JCassidyMusic kick for the past few days, and it's still goin on!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-10 16:15:36	No matter what, I know we will make things work, and that's what matters in the end.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-12 20:21:53	Watching shipping wars, some people just don't understand the crap some drivers go through....
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-14 05:09:29	Really tired of the crap I have to put up with just to drive. Another $200 spent on a useless piece of crap excuse for a truck.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-14 06:14:58	My stress level is literally higher than its ever been
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-17 04:40:04	Already started listening to the new album #TheUnderdog by @aaron_watson Be sure to go on iTunes and get yours! #TEXASCOUNTRY#GodblessTexas
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-20 13:43:08	I'm very proud of my cowgirl☺️
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-22 06:41:11	I feel as if every time I crank up my truck I'm putting not only my life, but someone else's life in danger. Last dodge I'll ever own.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-23 18:20:03	@kaybayy_14 how do you have class cancelled and I don't!😭😭
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-23 18:21:08	@kaybayy_14 that ain't right
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-24 04:33:33	And I called out to Jesus as a stranger. Asked for forgiveness, and he sent me an angel @Lynsey2015 http://t.co/ZFO6brvYM8
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-24 04:36:46	@bdjmustang what man?
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-24 04:39:39	@bdjmustang scared me for a second😂😂😂
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-26 16:12:16	No matter how many times I watch Lonesome Dove I always hate the part where Augustus dies.😔
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-25 01:52:42	So my economics professor lost my scantron to my exam. No biggie you know. Just went from a B to an F just like that and my anxiety spiked😶
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-25 05:26:43	I miss them beautiful brown eyes and amazing kisses. I miss everything about my cowgirl!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-28 05:57:11	A good night of spending time and dancing with my cowgirl. She's probably the best dance partner I could ask for!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-02-28 06:18:13	@bdjmustang @KyleRobertsks1 Thanks Obama😒
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-03-01 18:42:20	I can honestly say that being with her for 6 months has been the happiest time of my entire life!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-03-01 21:40:10	If you ain't watching The American Rodeo, quite frankly, I think you're a communist!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-03-08 05:25:28	If it's a dream chase after it with all you've got. Because when you succeed it'll be greater than any other feeling you've ever experienced
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-03-12 04:01:57	If I could gather the stars and put em in your hands, I'd look into your eyes and tell you, I love you all over again.🎸🎤🎶
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-03-18 03:05:59	Don't let anyone lie to you, going to college is great just please people make good decisions on what you do to help keep you from stressing
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-03-23 18:46:30	I have a test in all but one class this week. Shoot me 🔫
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-03-24 00:33:56	@Randi_Mizell no no. No one dies! Just a hospital visit to delay our test! So shot in the arm or leg!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-03-24 00:35:08	@Randi_Mizell 😐 to far Randi!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-03-24 21:18:07	It'll just take time🎸🎤🎶
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-03-25 20:49:15	There's a big ass difference between redneck and country and country and cowboy or cowgirl and if you can't learn it, GTF OUT OF TEXAS!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-03-25 20:50:28	And yes ma'am that was directed straight towards you!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-03-25 21:07:11	And if you're classy then learn some freaking respect and suck it up when you loose. Ain't the end of the world little girl. Grow up.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-03-26 14:52:18	Thanks to that little "classy/fabulous" buckle bunny, I'm gonna drop the next #1 Texas country single😝. Stay true to who you are people.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-03-26 02:14:26	All these buckle bunnies running around saying "I'm country" "I'm a cowgirl." Don't lie to yourself dear, just makes you look worse.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-03-28 03:34:45	Little half ton just needs to make it a little less than a year and then it can retire to the ranch.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-04-01 06:03:27	Headaches this late at night really do suck
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-04-02 17:57:11	Don't take who you are for granted and stay true to who you are🎸🎤🎶
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-04-05 02:44:05	Don't try to compare yourself to someone, be who you are and chase your dreams.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-04-07 00:33:34	Very proud of my cowgirl!!!!!!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-04-11 01:28:48	@7c60bb8b337d451 someone hacked my Twitter page
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-04-11 03:37:42	If you were tagged in a post that said it was from me 2 hours ago, it wasn't me. Someone's hacked my Twitter page Don't try to open the link
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-04-15 20:26:50	Come on Rangers. Pick it up boys!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-04-16 05:00:10	Tremendous amount of pain shooting through my body right now
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-04-17 00:40:31	Put it in the history books! Huntsville has had floods!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-04-19 03:38:48	Once again was hacked.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-04-19 06:35:52	Tonight was amazing. I'm truly thankful for the cowgirl that I call mine. I wouldn't trade her for anything in the world
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-04-23 04:55:19	She gives so much yet I feel like I give her so little sometimes😔
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-04-26 22:46:29	Just 9 more days!!!!!!!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-04-29 04:01:20	I do believe I'll go fishing Friday...
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-04-30 15:47:57	I just need an open road without a speed limit sign with an ice cold drink speeding these bad days outta my mind.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-05-04 16:35:32	It's finals week and you know what that means! Protect your pencils and scantrons with your life! Someone might try to steal them!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-05-05 02:06:20	3 finals down, 2 to go!

753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-05-12 01:31:57	Really wishing someone could just give me an '08 duramax right now😩

753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-05-20 06:21:15	I have the most uncomfortable bed ever😒
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-05-24 14:00:53	Sunday morning rain storm. Guess I'll be inside all day!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-05-25 05:17:05	My mind just really needs to learn to shut up and knock off the things that really just bug me into worrying...
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-05-25 20:07:04	Rangers game is underway! Let's go boys!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-05-29 22:52:35	It's just a never ending circle with this stupid freaking truck!
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-05-30 04:11:34	I just keep on waiting to be 21
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-05-30 05:01:58	There are two sides to every plan, both of them right now just don't equal out at all
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-05-30 01:35:55	I've never been bored to the point that I  set my guitar down and look at it...
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-06-01 19:33:20	9 months with this beautiful cowgirl. Never have I been so happy to be with someone😘 @Lynsey2015 http://t.co/n5jchtiwTS
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-06-06 05:03:13	A lot of people say that my relationship is a goal, yet we never set out on our journey thinking that.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-06-06 05:03:50	We weren't even really looking for a relationship, just someone to talk to and to be friends with.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-06-06 05:05:04	But someone called out to us and a strong bond truly took the place of friendship.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-06-06 05:07:25	I thank God every day that I get to wake up that the girlfriend that is mine is still there to start the day by putting a smile on my face.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-06-06 05:08:31	You see, it's not the fact that we started out to be a goal,
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-06-06 05:09:07	We started out to better ourselves, to support one another, and to find something that we had both lost in the years before.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-06-06 05:10:45	We aren't goals, we are just who we want to be, happy together, for always and forever.
753673128	_ethanlane_	2015-06-10 20:13:32	When you think your day is about done but your dad already is making work for you to do this evening😩
