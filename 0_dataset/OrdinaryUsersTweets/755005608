755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-07 11:07:32	@david_navigator Ah spelt! "But you can have spelt, because it's an *ancient* grain, can't you?"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-07 12:24:33	#glutenfree  stained glass cookies - from my book. http://t.co/CfSpcnoi
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-07 15:07:20	@Jane_Barringer I'm trying to find a way to make it more filling though, veg protein is never as satifying as animal protein.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-07 15:12:45	@Jane_Barringer Ah yes, sorry, didn't see that! Tuna would be great. Next time...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-07 12:36:54	@Slaintemagazine Hi Maria, I have one in my book, "Gluten-free Baking at Christmas" http://t.co/OZH21Iia :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-07 15:07:35	@ZenHarmony Thanks! Wanna buy the book? ;)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 14:57:01	New flyer for my book, RT and help spread the word! :) #glutenfree #christmas #baking http://t.co/f4xAyfYz
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 15:00:55	@amyruthbaking Really pleased I can have pancakes and it can actually be healthy now! Plus they are super delicious - I'm a teff convert!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 15:04:11	@gfreeb @PureHClinic @davidj_gf I found an interesting talk on this subject: quite long but worth it. http://t.co/T8q2VYMK
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 15:19:32	@PureHClinic @gfreeb @davidj_gf I remain skeptical as to some of the stats thrown around, but it's an interesting piece.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 15:42:02	@coeliacme How big did you make them? That's odd, never had that happen to me before! :-S
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-09 13:40:12	@baileybiggar Yeah, timing will vary oven to oven unfortunately. How long were they in for?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 16:59:32	@gfreeb @HealthJourno @trulyglutenfree @davidj_gf Credibility slowly diminshing...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 17:04:34	@gfreeb Luckily (for us, at least) they mostly seem to be in the US. Perhaps when the #glutenfree "fadders" have moved on they will too.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 17:07:36	@gfreeb Exactly. See hype about "Wheat Belly". I wish I had no scruples sometimes, I'd be a lot richer.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 17:25:39	@gfreeb You're a geek after my own heart! Just about to read Bad Pharma...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 18:39:50	Just realised its Saturday night and I'm singing "Pocketful of sunshine" rather loudly by myself. #easya #loser #atleastitsbetterthanxfactor

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-09 06:44:39	6am wakeup call from the cat. Lovely.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-09 13:43:23	@baileybiggar You should be able to take it down to 10 mins if your oven is a bit hot.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-09 13:50:32	@baileybiggar I made a video tutorial in case you can pick up any tips from that! http://t.co/HWXth9JB
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-10 16:30:36	Roasted duck w/ saffron risotto tonight. yum yum.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-11 18:03:52	@baileybiggar Hooray! But what do they look like?! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-13 15:32:05	Just had a response from a customer services team 10 minutes after I sent the e-mail... must be the end of the world...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-13 15:36:11	So true!! http://t.co/gkyrbKz2
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-13 15:45:18	Props to @virginexp for letting me know within 10 mins whether an experience was suitable for coeliacs! Very pleased! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-13 19:19:04	@rebelbakery cupcakes ftw! But how am I going to try 5?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-13 21:58:01	Gorged myself @ the launch party of @rebelbakery 's pop up store. Go visit them in Willesden Green from tomorrow! #glutenfree xmas cupcakes!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 17:22:35	@TrussellTrust Do you accept donations of #glutenfree food for coeliacs? Is this an area where the gf community could help?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 17:38:41	@gfreeb Sounds awesome! Can I swear a lot in it? :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 17:39:17	@gfreeb I might do "Oh, you don't like wheat?"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 17:40:54	@gfreeb Or something along the lines of people thinking we are fussy eaters!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 17:41:53	@gfreeb Yes! Love the comedy bleeps. What format should it be in?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 17:57:03	@WendyBoother Thanks :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 18:12:19	Need a #christmas present for a #coeliac? Look no further! #glutenfree http://t.co/OZH21Iia

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-10 19:02:25	@coeliacme I guess my sieve must have smaller holes than yours! I'm pretty sure I did it with a sieve too!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 19:27:32	Fish balls and butternut squash #glutenfree #healthkick http://t.co/w2KkP7sn
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 19:39:23	@CeliacBaby Coley+spring onions+kale, in a blender w/ eggwhite, soy sauce, fish sauce, then steamed for 5 minutes. Really easy and cheap!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-08 19:41:07	@CeliacBaby My first venture into fish balls, and I'm quite pleased with it! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-14 09:05:16	@EmmaDallos @rebelbakery I had the gingerbread one and it was divine!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-14 11:02:08	#ff @rebelbakery Their pop-up xmas shop opens TODAY! Read my review here: http://t.co/C69pEVMv
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-09 11:14:23	@baileybiggar Ooh, let me know how it goes! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-10 10:11:14	Oh Monday. Sigh.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-12 10:30:31	Would anyone who has tried out one of my #glutenfree #christmas recipes like to do a review on their blog?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-12 10:33:38	@CupcakeCornerUK Thanks! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-12 10:38:51	@coeliacme They look so pretty! Love how you've hung them on the tree :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-12 10:39:08	@baileybiggar Amazing! Which recipe did you use?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-12 10:42:42	@coeliacme Bahaha! I love it when #glutenfree sceptics end up stuffing their face with gf food :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-12 10:54:16	To those who have been putting off ordering my book - do it now so it will get to you in plenty of time for Christmas! http://t.co/OZH21Iia

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-12 10:57:51	@coeliacme People need to realise that most #glutenfree baking does not taste bad! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-12 11:44:24	This is basically what's been happening all morning, except with more shouting #badkitty http://t.co/WhxPhJqL
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-12 11:52:45	@AngelaMcKeller Will gladly post to the US, but metric only (I figured most scales can do both?)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-12 11:57:02	@AngelaMcKeller Hahaha!!! But seriously, trying to use cups w/ #glutenfree is a recipe for disaster... so innaccurate!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-12 11:58:59	@wbites I thought a fake tree would be easier, but no. Now she's just curled up being all cute and my xmas tree looks very sad!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-12 12:00:28	@AngelaMcKeller Thanks for RT :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-12 12:06:15	@AngelaMcKeller If I am I'll know who to blame! ;)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-13 08:32:19	Very excited about the @rebelbakery pop up launch tonight!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-13 09:01:10	@GlutenFreeMrsD @rebelbakery Such a shame! Hope to see you soon!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-13 09:06:50	@coeliacme @rebelbakery I totally understand. It's a bit of a trek for me, luckily only 2 trains, but will take 1h20
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-13 09:26:30	@coeliacme @rebelbakery Feel better - plenty of time to get your cake on before Christmas! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-13 11:12:41	@gfreeb @rebelbakery Hooray! :-)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-17 11:08:21	@rebelbakery No problems - it was wonderful to meet you too and eat your delicious cake! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-17 11:43:39	@freefromfairy @Coeliac_UK @BS_GlutenFree Tesco do an own brand hula hoop which taste just the same and seem to be #coeliac safe

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-17 16:08:38	@GF_Photographer Hope you enjoy! Let me know how the baking goes!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-20 10:16:36	If youre running behind on your #glutenfree xmas baking, don't forget you can order my ebook and get it instantly! http://t.co/OZH21Iia
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-20 10:48:56	@coeliacme I'm lucky in that I have a small family &amp; don't need to buy a lot of gifts - and yet somehow there are boxfuls of them...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-20 17:34:53	Think I may make @jamieoliver mulled wine tonight!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-21 14:03:31	gorging on cheese on #glutenfree toast. Waiting for the longer days...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-20 10:19:09	Incidentally, how is it 4 DAYS until Christmas? The last few months seem to have flown by!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-22 08:39:37	I think it's safe to say that Christmas officially starts today.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-24 10:23:38	Merry Xmas everyone &amp; hope you've all found plenty of delicious #glutenfree food for the holiday period! xoxo
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-28 15:18:08	Finally home from a very long Christmas! Need some internet, my own bed and a long sleep!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-31 19:04:53	I'm pretty sure Girls Aloud should be calling themselves women by now.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-31 19:38:39	Why is everyone calling it two thousand and thirteen? Surely twenty thirteen is so much easier?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-31 21:44:02	@gfreeb Not that I haven't had tummy upsets, but they've been unrelated to gluten! ;) But then again I don't eat out a lot.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-01 11:20:07	Sale now on! Buy my book in January for only £8.49! (normally 11.99) http://t.co/2kgLe19w #glutenfree #coeliac
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-01 11:24:54	Or if you'd prefer my book as a pdf, that's on sale too for the bargalicious price of £3.99! http://t.co/TznlYH8e #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-31 10:11:44	Only dog owners would say "Oh, he won't hurt you" AFTER the dog has jumped up and scratched me. Not a happy bunny.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-31 10:34:42	@MiriamCoshan :( And then I'M the one made to feel bad about it: "Oh you shouldn't have made eye contact!". Boxer owners are the worst!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-01 13:32:46	@KitschnBake Happy New Year to you too! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-01 13:34:08	My kitten is finally becoming a young lady. Meowling and scratching at the windows. Time for the snip!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-01 13:43:27	@gilbo_the_2nd She's almost 6 months. Just the other day started this weird (and v annoying) behaviour!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-01 13:44:36	@HealthJourno Interesting!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-01 13:46:33	@gilbo_the_2nd I know - she's still so small! But she's desperate to go out, which she has never been before. Better an op than kittens.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-01 14:23:36	@gilbo_the_2nd We're keeping ours in... our last cat ran away and we couldn't bear to lose another :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-01 15:27:24	@CookieQueen1987 Desperately looking for the neighbourhood kitties! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-01 18:41:13	Having a go at Dak Galbi, inspired by @BeyondKimchee and my local Korean supermarket!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-03 11:51:53	OK, have a working title for my next #glutenfree book &amp; it's high time to make a start! Will be based around everyday and weekend dinners...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-31 16:51:22	@RuthLTurner I am thanks just a bit shaken up &amp; hole in my leggings! I don't hate dogs, but I certainly hate some of their owners sometimes!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-31 16:52:13	492 followers! Can I get to 500 by 2013? :-) #glutenfree #coeliac
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-28 18:43:08	Loving the #fitbit I got for Christmas! Anyone else on it?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-31 17:21:04	Preparing the crab for tonight and giggling as air escapes from its bottom... #growupsam! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-31 17:25:12	Cheers and Happy New Year to all my #glutenfree peeps! Managed to survive 2012 without a glutening &amp; get a book out too! What a year! xoxo
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-31 17:26:36	@RuthLTurner I am just a bit scared of dogs due to a lifetime of witnessing bad owners. They are just so unpredictable! Cats all the way! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-31 17:27:50	@kgollop And to you too! Any plans for tonight?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-31 17:30:09	@kgollop Night in with expensive food we normally wouldn't buy. Steak, crab, giant prawns, champagne!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-31 17:43:29	@AmethystBlaize Haha! Although maybe pick something you have more control over - otherwise you might never eat out! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-03 13:07:26	@ironwolf69 First recipe tested - a tomato and red pepper noodle soup!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 10:41:05	Back to blogging for me! My food resolutions for 2013! http://t.co/Z7LuxWdq #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 13:18:50	@coeliacme Very! Polenta + water + stirring + bit more water if needed + seasoning = yummy!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 13:20:13	@coeliacme I like to fry it alongside a cooked breakfast! Nice as a source of carbs to go with bacon, sausages, mushrooms etc
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 13:22:57	@coeliacme Oh that looks great! I'm going through a korean phase at the moment...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 13:25:20	@coeliacme Both really, plus there's a korean supermarket so close and everything has cartoon characters on it! ;) Sure, ask away!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 13:29:51	@coeliacme I don't see why not! I'd use a plain gf flour &amp; sub cornmeal for semolina. I think @HoneybunsBakery have a custard creams recipe?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 13:30:22	@coeliacme @HoneybunsBakery have a custard cream and bourbon biscuit recipe that might convert!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 13:56:40	@gfandfabulous @coeliacme Totally agree, great for "breadcrumbing" anything - love doing crispy chicken!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 13:59:17	@gfandfabulous @coeliacme What did you get? #livingvicariouslythroughyou
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 14:21:31	@GlutenDude Amazing what can be achieved with a little #celiac #solidarity! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 15:25:51	Tesco has Easter eggs out. TESCO HAS EASTER EGGS OUT. This continual anticipation for the next "holiday" is exhausting.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 15:28:10	@coeliacme Who is actually buying Easter eggs right now anyway???
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 15:30:18	@coeliacme Ugh, I just need to never see chocolate, cakes or biscuits ever again. At least until I've lost the book weight.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 15:34:42	@wbites They are right next to the Christmas chocolate... I think the zombie apocalypse might be upon us. Or the Mayans were right.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 16:42:29	@wbites So glad I hate hot cross buns!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 16:49:16	OK, #glutenfree peeps. Who's up for a #tweetup at @BruschettaGF sometime soon? I want pizza! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 16:57:08	@beccafetts Woop! Would day time be easier for those with kiddos?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 16:59:57	@beccafetts Everywhere in London is so far away! Seems like it takes an hour to get anywhere, no matter where you are going!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 17:05:49	@MissWeston100 @coeliacme Polenta is coarser than cornmeal, but it's the same plant :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 17:11:21	@MissWeston100 @coeliacme Cornmeal is much more like flour, usually only found in the world foods aisle. Useful for #gf cooking though!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 17:16:43	Bruschetta meetup on Saturday 12th January at 7pm. #glutenfree pizza &amp; pasta! http://t.co/swV0cnkg
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 17:32:50	@CookieQueen1987 Were they ever gone?!?! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 17:44:15	Pork dumplings for dinner, using @IsabelsCuisine pizza mix... the question is, steamed or fried?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 18:13:06	@MonocledMum @IsabelsCuisine Isabel's do a mix which I think will also work well for dumpling cases
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-04 11:56:48	New post: #glutenfree pork and cabbage dumplings! http://t.co/rKVTzxmm
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-04 12:20:54	@wbites But they're only 8 calories each ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-04 12:25:25	@wbites BBQ flavour by any chance?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-04 12:26:08	@wbites BBQ FTW!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-04 13:00:51	@kgollop @noomie82 @wbites According to their website, nothing has changed - still all #glutenfree &amp; suitable for #coeliacs
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 19:18:30	@IsabelsCuisine It seems to have worked!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 19:36:38	@IsabelsCuisine #glutenfree pork and cabbage dumplings a la Isabel http://t.co/9jRqhqrl
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 19:39:44	@GlutenFreeMrsD Definitely! I'm always up for a trip to Bruschetta :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 19:39:54	@gfreeb Shame - next time though?!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 19:40:23	@GlutenFreeWife1 They were sat next to the discounted xmas chocolate. Never a sadder sight was seen.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 19:40:44	@skeeterrific1 Next time! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-02 19:57:40	@beccafetts @isabelscuisine Using this mix made up the normal way - w/egg, oil &amp; water http://t.co/5OGcOn2H
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-05 09:16:05	If anyone wants to come to Bruschetta next Saturday evening can you DM me please so I can make the booking?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-05 09:22:23	Details for next Sat #glutenfree meetup at Bruschetta here: http://t.co/swV0cnkg DM me if you want to go!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-05 11:11:07	@lovetreacle There will be other meetups, I'm sure :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-05 15:58:16	@beccafetts No worries, I'm sure we'll do it another time! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-05 15:58:41	@flobristow Oh no! But I'm sure we'll do it again sometime :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-05 16:00:45	@flobristow @BruschettaGF Have you never been before?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2012-12-29 11:54:44	Breakfast hash, #glutenfree http://t.co/wAdqwbQV
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-07 13:38:17	Awesome #glutenfree discovery of the week: Korean rice cakes! Good way to bulk up a soup! #addicted
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-11 09:07:42	@flobristow @GFBlogger @gfcakelover @HealthJourno @claire_tulloch @gfhazlenut @gfreeb @kgollop Thanks, have a great weekend all! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-12 15:03:01	Did some indoor gardening this afternoon. Still cold. But at least I have some kitchen herbs growing now!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-08 14:38:28	Difficult being on a diet when you're a food blogger - can never stop thinking about food! arrgh
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-08 16:10:49	@___Charlotte__ Definitely!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-11 19:39:17	How #glutenfree friendly is the Netherlands? I've heard its very good, but I wanted to know what people's experiences were like.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-09 11:00:07	A nice infographic on how to eat good and cheap food http://t.co/PR2M3paz
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-14 09:26:03	Would a £50 @SainsburysPR voucher giveaway on my blog brighten up your Monday? Find out more here: http://t.co/RnqP6A31
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-14 09:31:04	@p4ula1 @Coeliac_UK Unfortunately I haven't been to Rome since diagnosis but I know @GlutenFreeMrsD has a wealth of information...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-14 09:41:21	@chrisNhook6 Great to talk to you too! I'm looking forward to coming up to see you in February! (And looking forward to trying the samples!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-14 09:44:54	@GlutenFreeMrsD No worries! You + #glutenfree Italy are an immediate association in my mind! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-07 14:12:49	@dorsieDoreen That doesn't sound bad at all! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-07 21:43:32	I just walked 15,000 steps and got a badge. Hurrah! http://t.co/3mSKnoR0 #Fitstats
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-07 22:38:56	@fluffywelshshee I know! I've already lost 1.5kg in the first week! Very awesome device.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 13:53:55	@Emmavon You mean a blog or on Twitter?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 13:54:43	@Silversixpencew See if you can hold out for the rest of the test results - it can be difficult but it's better to know for sure!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 13:57:58	@Silversixpencew Has she had the biopsy done?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 13:59:48	@Silversixpencew Then she should (in theory) stay on gluten and have a gut biopsy before any diagnosis can be made, esp if blood tests low
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 14:02:04	@Emmavon There's @gfreeb @GlutenFreeMrsD @philvickerytv @kgollop @HealthJourno @wbites ... um... and loads more!! (Just to name a few)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 14:03:47	@Silversixpencew Best way to get answers is to stay on gluten and get the biopsy done. @Coeliac_UK have a helpline if you have further q's
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 14:04:16	@Silversixpencew It's difficult to see her suffering but knowing for sure what's wrong will be best for her in the end. Good luck! x
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 14:05:27	@gfreeb Couldn't leave you out with your award winning giant #gf burgers :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 14:06:44	@Silversixpencew Worth talking to coeliac uk too, just 2 give you the "official" advice and feel confident in standing up to GP if necessary
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 17:07:50	@glutenfreefreak http://t.co/sIsoyTDM Try that!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 17:14:25	@glutenfreefreak Argh! Sorry - your username is very similar to another here in the UK :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 17:23:20	@glutenfreefreak @GlutenFreek Glad it's not just me going crazy! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-14 15:51:00	£50 worth of vouchers in exchange for a healthy recipe: http://t.co/RnqP6A31
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 18:24:02	DERP! RT @GlutenDude: Can #gluten help a #celiac? This CHEF seems to think so. http://t.co/brGFBpWe
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-14 17:19:56	@Silversixpencew @SainsburysPR If you have any questions about #glutenfree food, do ask me! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-14 18:37:31	@Silversixpencew Glad you caught it soon, now she can concentrate on growing and getting healthy! Rather this than 20+ years of uncertainty.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 10:52:17	The first entry to my £50 @SainsburysPR voucher giveaway is up, thanks to @gfreeb! http://t.co/5qY0rAZZ
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-10 17:26:25	Very excited about a giveaway on my blog coming up next week - gonna need your healthy #glutenfree recipes!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-08 08:47:15	@fluffywelshshee Thanks, I literally went from 0 activity and loads of sugar to 0 sugar and loads of activity.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-08 08:49:10	@fluffywelshshee I've tried on various programs before but I find the whole thing such a faff! Just keeping an eye on what I eat really!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-08 08:54:03	@fluffywelshshee Fitbit would be ok if it had more normal foods and not American junk food on it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-08 08:54:39	@fluffywelshshee For the last week I haven't been eating any special "gf" products - just rice, potatoes etc.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-08 08:55:02	@fluffywelshshee Yeah, I think I will look into that - my bf does it so I'll get him to show me :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 21:08:57	Horse meat burger, anyone? http://t.co/kzQANHmh
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 21:49:37	@gfreeb So glad I make my own these days! (With I hope not horse mince)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-16 08:19:07	@FamilyLifeFife And the "freefrom" burgers/sausages are never really that appealing! (At least not the Tesco ones!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-16 14:01:23	Another entry into the @SainsburysPR £50 voucher competition: Lucinda's recipe for quick and easy salmon! http://t.co/NHdEajC0

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-16 15:21:47	Found a quiet afternoon and started to write the introduction to my new #glutenfree book! Actully getting pretty excited about it now!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-20 12:03:21	@lovelactosefree @SainsburysPR Very nice! Perhaps they could be adapted to be healthy? ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-20 12:06:59	@lovelactosefree @SainsburysPR Does it count as healthy?!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-20 12:11:15	@lovelactosefree @SainsburysPR I guess you could try it with stevia - I've baked with this before http://t.co/uYF6AbTP, and perhaps less oil
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-20 12:19:35	@lovelactosefree @SainsburysPR That's always a good plan! I think if ur trying to lose weight to have to have both good diet &amp; exercise tho!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-20 12:29:41	@lovelactosefree Haha that binging is called an "extination burst"! http://t.co/EHoJzjCC
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-20 12:37:30	@lovelactosefree Oh I didn't mean to offend, I just find the psychology of diet/exercise really fascinating! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-20 12:39:06	@lovelactosefree I know, it's so difficult to further restrict yourself! However, that is how I put on 5kg over the last few months... ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-20 12:42:19	@lovelactosefree Well, I've been cutting out all treats and exercising a lot, already lost 2.3kg since New Year. Cats don't help w/exercise!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-15 10:54:18	@gfreeb @SainsburysPR I'm on a roll this week! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-20 19:38:29	@gfreeb Yes they can! They are called "Flying Saucer Cakes" in my #glutenfree xmas book.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-20 20:13:07	Trying a modified version of these: http://t.co/7cYeCI1J #glutenfree AND #vegan AND #lowcalorie

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-20 21:04:24	@gfreeb They are actually one of my favourites of the whole lot! Yum yum. Still on a diet though, so no more baking for a while yet...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-20 21:10:16	@gfreeb I know completely what you mean - by December I only had one pair of trousers that still fit me. Curse of the food bloggers...

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-21 09:23:24	Depressed about it being "Blue Monday"? Don't be, it's all nonsense! :-) http://t.co/fmFR72pI
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-21 10:35:31	Just enrolled for "A taste of food journalism" at CityLit. Thanks to whoever recommended it! http://t.co/M6xWGNuG
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-21 10:43:14	@gfreeb @beccafetts The joy of working from home - dressing gown and slippers over normal clothes... :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-21 10:59:02	@Annies_Larder @gfreeb @beccafetts Although I should probably leave the house at some point today - starting to get a little too comfy!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-21 13:09:08	Tesco do their own version of alphabites... and without gluten! #happyday
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-21 13:31:35	@GFbubble They look to be #glutenfree http://t.co/5T35THFD and were yummier than I remember! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-17 21:52:28	@beccafetts @IsabelsCuisine http://t.co/rKVTzxmm Try this one!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-21 20:39:42	Would anyone be interested in an online course aimed at helping people adapt to #glutenfree living?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-21 20:43:23	@baking_freefrom My current idea is to have a series of topics to work through (at your own pace) on various aspects of #gf living
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-21 20:45:00	@baking_freefrom I think aimed at beginners to start with though!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-21 21:08:30	@baking_freefrom Brill thanks! Maybe if it goes well I'll develop a whole series of courses!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-24 14:32:18	I spend my life avoiding breadcrumbs &amp; invisible dustings of flour only to realise @LushLtd put wheatgrass in so many things! #getitoffme!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-24 14:51:02	@WildThexton @lushltd Yes, but I seem to have a problem with even #glutenfree wheat. Not sure what part of the plant I react to though...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-24 14:51:59	@david_navigator True, but I'm getting through a lot of lip balm this winter! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-24 16:01:01	@AmethystBlaize @LushLtd I'm very sensitive to some of their products. Just because it's "natural" doesn't mean it can't be an irritant.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-22 09:29:01	@MarietaORiordan Did you get referred to a dietician at all?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-22 09:32:05	@MarietaORiordan Gosh, I hope thats not a long term thing - I went on that before diagnosis - you can barely eat anything!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-22 10:22:30	@MarietaORiordan I found myself basically eating plain meat &amp;boiled rice. Hope you find your triggers - mine is eating too much! (seriously)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-22 14:23:35	Waiting for a DSLR camera to come off on eBay! So tense, but hopefully will soon be taking better photos for my blog!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-22 14:36:01	I am the soon to be owner of a DSLR camera, complete with macro lens for all my #foodporn needs! Love eBay!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-22 15:04:03	@beglutenfreeB Just seen your review of Box Rocks pizza - do you know what sort of X-contamination precautions they take?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-22 15:25:44	@beglutenfreeB I'm quite a sensitive #coeliac so I think I'll ask them! Ta :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-22 15:31:02	@yummyGFpamcakes @giddyyoyo Now I SERIOUSLY want chocolate!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-22 15:34:57	@yummyGFpamcakes @giddyyoyo So hard to find chocolate without soy these days! Maybe when I'm next over there I'll pick some up! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-22 15:37:18	@yummyGFpamcakes Whole Foods (London) does a good selection... I guess I should pop in there, empty my wallet and get my fix!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-22 15:42:42	@yummyGFpamcakes And none of that carob stuff!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-25 15:10:10	@PIZZAFACEPIZZA Thankyou, as long as u are aware &amp; reasonable precautions taken I'm sure it will be fine. Hoping to drop by for lunch tomo!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-25 23:19:35	@VeniceBakeryUK Ooh, your pizza bases look good! Must give them a try sometime! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-24 13:10:49	@wetherbywhaler Looking forward to trying it out next time I'm up there! :-) #glutenfree #fishandchips
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-26 14:37:15	Great #glutenfree pizza from @PIZZAFACEPIZZA in Brighton today! Review &amp; photos to follow...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-24 13:50:41	@PIZZAFACEPIZZA Hi there, are your #glutenfree pizzas suitable for coeliacs &amp; do you have cross contamination measures in place? Thanks :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-24 14:48:50	@WildThexton @lushltd It's WHEATY! :P I know it shouldn't cause a reaction but something about slathering it on me doesn't feel right...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-24 17:12:19	@HensKitchen No, can't have oats :( Shame as they are really useful!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 13:32:55	Return of the cakemonster: one strawberry/champagne valentine's cake in the oven!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 14:02:23	Some champagne for the cake... some champagne for me... etc etc
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 14:10:27	@coeliacme I'm sure you can make it too... :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 14:10:37	@CookieQueen1987 Cake or champagne? :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 15:03:41	@coeliacme It's very similar to my chocolate present cake from my book. So.. um, yes it is easy? You can make it in the food processor.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 15:13:26	@wbites Want me to send him an e-mail with a very big hint? :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 15:16:05	@wbites It's pretty simple, actually. You can make it in the food processor...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 15:18:29	@wbites Haha, I see! Well maybe you could make it for him then? :P #browniepoints
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 15:22:33	@coeliacme Strawberry flakes! Weirdly enough, made with gluten-free wheat flour... not in the freefrom aisle or anything
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 15:23:07	@wbites @coeliacme Well I'm lucky in that my bf is an amazing cook, but then I have to put up with supermarket flowers... if I'm lucky
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 15:30:09	@wbites @coeliacme Waah! I want some big gestures!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 16:18:15	Ok, my website is back up (for anyone who missed it!) ;) http://t.co/Ht2nKLiL
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 16:22:38	@noomie82 @nels3 @HealthyCookCo I've been there, lovely cake! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 16:23:15	@JennifersWayJE Congratulations! Can't wait to visit in the Spring :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 16:29:33	@Blue_wells Thank you :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 16:32:34	@glutenfreegirl Wow! I wish I could
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 16:36:29	Anyone richer than me should seriously consider this #glutenfree getaway to Tuscany! http://t.co/QMSOHEPD
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-30 16:52:24	#glutenfree Strawberry &amp; champagne cake made with @amyruthbaking flour! http://t.co/Q1u3ktm2
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-29 16:57:34	Sneak peek of my new-look site. Aiming to get it live tomorrow! After nearly 2 years, I think it's time for a change http://t.co/Xop5DfAE
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-29 16:59:30	@noomie82 Thanks - and nice pic! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-29 18:56:25	@FoodAllergySite Thanks :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-29 18:56:34	@GlutenFreeWife1 Thank you! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-28 21:12:47	Spent all afternoon getting my site ready for the new theme... hopefully will be finished tomorrow!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-31 11:35:05	Review of @PIZZAFACEPIZZA 's #glutenfree pizza in #Brighton http://t.co/DuQdJaTa #yum
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-31 12:18:31	@EmmaDallos @PIZZAFACEPIZZA I was so blown away by the tasty toppings! May have to go back to Brighton ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-31 13:46:19	I'm looking for max 15 ppl to trial my new online course, "Gluten-free cooking for novices" @ a reduced price. Details: http://t.co/YmFez7wp
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-31 16:17:09	@AGirl_Defloured Meat/veggies stir fries with rice noodles and chilli/garlic paste - great for clearing out the fridge! #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-01-31 16:17:19	@AGirl_Defloured Meat/veggies stir fries with rice noodles and chilli/garlic paste - great for clearing out the fridge! #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-01 19:05:44	@cocorosey Cool, thanks!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-01 19:42:35	@gfreeb I trust them - to make the one dish on their menu that's #gf :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-01 19:55:48	@beccafetts Yeah, it's not a large choice, but it's some at least.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-02 16:33:27	@rebelbakery where is your stall based? Can't find you anywhere!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-01 18:58:32	Has anyone eaten #glutenfree at @giraffetweet restaurant? They have good allergy menu online but wondering what ur experiences have been.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-01 19:04:09	@gfreeb Just trying to find somewhere nice for lunch in High St Ken...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-01 19:06:04	@happywombelle I think it's pretty standard chain food, from the looks of things
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-01 19:09:35	@gfreeb Never heard of Balans before... will look it up. Always a bit disappointed w/ #gf selection in WFM. Just want something easy.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-01 19:54:59	@david_navigator Thanks!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-01 19:55:23	@Perkierfoods I'll have to look into that - thanks!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-01 19:12:42	@gfreeb OMG - Wagamama has started doing sushi! That's my decision made ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-01 19:41:59	@TheColinWoodley I used the cereal allergy filter on their site - there seemed to still be a lot of options (unless I did it wrong!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-01 19:56:36	@beccafetts @gfreeb I once had a server who had a milk allergy and she sat down with me &amp; the menu at length to discuss #gf options
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-02 08:31:44	@rebelbakery See you at @WFM_Kensington this afternoon! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-02 09:25:29	Currently sitting w/ egg and olive oil in my hair - hoping this works otherwise I've basically just put mayonnaise on my head for no reason
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-02 10:22:28	@GF_All_The_Way @gfreeb I usually go for that coconutty soup thingy, which is pretty nice. But yeah, not much choice for mains.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-02 11:06:58	@GlutenFreeMrsD @GF_All_The_Way @gfreeb Really? Hmm, that is concerning!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-07 08:51:08	Oh go away, cold, I can't spend the whole week in bed! I have things to do! :(

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-07 11:26:46	@chrisNhook6 All I have is tequila and green tea...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-07 16:35:30	#glutenfree #coffeeshops in #Amsterdam - do they exist?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-07 18:50:33	@PAMDUNN3 There's a gap in the market! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-05 08:49:30	@FamilyLifeFife What are the MAD blog awards?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-05 08:59:43	@FamilyLifeFife @MadBlogAwards Ooh, exciting!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-05 09:04:15	@FamilyLifeFife And congrats on your pregnancy :) (Just read your latest post...)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-05 09:13:13	The winner of my £50 Sainsbury's voucher giveaway is.... http://t.co/B3pTeYyg
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-08 09:36:46	I seem to have changed my mind about "my next big #glutenfree project" so many times! But I think I'm finally on the right track!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-08 12:09:52	@coeliacme :-D I'll give you a hint, it will be aimed at #glutenfree newbies... (but I'll want old timers to review it as well!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-08 12:17:07	@wbites Everytime you tweet at me, I get Kate Bush stuck in my head... I hope you're happy! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-08 12:21:34	@wbites http://t.co/xnUUj2Tn &lt;-- this is basically just going round and round in my head
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-08 12:23:50	@wbites I'll get you back, even if it takes 5, 10, 50 years. I'll think of a pun more devious... I will!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-08 12:24:33	@wbites Maaaaybe....
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-08 12:58:22	@coeliacme Of course!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-08 16:25:46	I've now suggested chocolate pizza for dinner 3 times and still the bf laughs as if I were joking.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-08 16:49:47	@coeliacme I was thinking @IsabelsCuisine mix + cocoa powder, nutella, marshmallows and bananas...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-08 16:52:15	@coeliacme @IsabelsCuisine Let me know if you get a more enthusiastic reaction... ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-11 09:56:11	@stace8383 Ha! Not YET, anyway! #cynical ....
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-11 09:57:13	@baileybiggar Yeah, pretty much! Different flours work better than others for pancakes, I like the @HaleHeartyFoods 4 grain mix.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-11 16:09:32	Cutting your own hair - not as hard as I thought! The bf has assured me it doesn't look wonky...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-11 09:53:37	Into my 5th day of being ill - this is really getting ridiculous now. :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-13 13:46:49	White choc &amp; raspberry truffles in the fridge - writing up the recipe now!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-14 09:32:44	#glutenfree prescriptions face scrutiny in the media today, what are your thoughts? http://t.co/RSYCCceX
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-14 09:54:58	Happy #GlutenFree Valentines! May your friends, family or lovers cook the gluten-free meal of your dreams!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-12 09:12:24	@gfreeb @wbites @kgollop @coeliacme Love the H&amp;H mix! LOVE IT
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-14 13:23:17	@beccafetts @gfreeb It's v difficult not to - I did when I was 10 and face swelled up! Mum felt so bad she let me stay home :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-14 13:32:18	@baileybiggar I have but I wondered if anyone had specific recommendations since not everyone has a blog ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-14 14:36:49	@colettemulder Thanks! We are going in early March, with a view to perhaps living there for a bit!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-15 14:28:54	What are your thoughts on #glutenfree prescriptions in the UK for #coeliacs? http://t.co/RSYCCceX
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-15 15:18:18	New post! Review of Saf Restaurant in High St Kensington #glutenfree #vegetarian #vegan http://t.co/uOPlPwg3
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-15 15:37:36	@coeliacme Buy it online!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-15 15:46:28	@coeliacme @IsabelsCuisine I think she will... :) We love it so much we order 15 boxes at a time #obsessed
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-15 15:53:26	@coeliacme Or you can always go in on our order and we can send it to you cheaper?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-13 09:07:20	White chocolate &amp; raspberry valentines chocolates... #glutenfree... coming up! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-13 10:50:55	11 biggest lies of mainstream nutrition... http://t.co/Mu3KUeSy
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-13 13:55:42	@coeliacme Haha, if there are any left by tonight!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-13 14:12:19	Sorry, but these are the least exciting #bump pictures ever. I look more pregnant than that after too much cheese. #wannabuymypics?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-15 18:11:24	After that #glutenfree strawberry cake I have loads of strawberry nesquik to use up - so strawberry cookies it is then! #nom #justforme
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-13 17:18:27	Still stuck on a #glutenfree treat for #valentines? Try these white chocolate and raspberry truffles! http://t.co/FaLElR5s
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-13 19:14:59	@Sunnysideup17 I love the @HoneybunsBakery cookbook! If that helps! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-16 09:22:04	@baileybiggar Sorry, the only one I know that does #gf is Hakkasan! (And I've never been bc it's too ££)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-14 10:49:36	@gfreeb Uh oh! Hope you're feeling ok - whenever I've had anaesthetic I can't resist slapping my own face.... #weirdo
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-14 13:29:38	Any recommendations for #coeliac safe #glutenfree eating in #Amsterdam or #Haarlem?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-14 13:36:37	@colettemulder Thanks for that link - very useful!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-14 13:36:48	@colettemulder Have you been there yourself?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-14 13:52:57	@colettemulder Thanks very much - looking forward to our little trip away now :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-15 10:49:04	@wbites @coeliacme @noomie82 @kgollop @gfcakelover @gfreeb @DavidJ_GF @CurlyB56 @disenchantedsl Happy Friday everyone! :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-17 18:05:49	@CucinaCeri Thanks for recommending the food journalism course at CityLit - really enjoyed it and the teacher mentioned you!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-17 18:15:26	@CucinaCeri Yes indeed! And wonderful words about you were spoken, fear not! She did call you Ceri Cucina though :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-17 18:27:33	@CucinaCeri Yeah, was pretty cool, and quite a confidence booster too!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-16 18:48:17	The bf reminding me of early days after diagnosis: "oh the tears over pizza!" haha, luckily it's @IsabelsCuisine pizza tonight ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-16 18:53:49	@aw4268 @IsabelsCuisine @pizzahut @Dominos_UK Still not as nice as Isabel's :-) #awomanobsessed
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-16 18:56:07	@aw4268 @pizzahut @Dominos_UK @IsabelsCuisine I still haven't tried Pizza Hut ones yet...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-18 20:40:41	@ChristenDali just make sure you google any ideas... There are so many that a lot of names are taken!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-18 20:43:02	@anniesupperclub @WarbsNewburnBH I'm very excited! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-18 20:44:38	@chrisNhook6 please let it be doughnuts! Please please! ;-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-12 09:09:23	#glutenfree pancakes? These are my favourite so far: http://t.co/CqBzc4Br
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-13 14:09:55	@coeliacme He's not the #coeliac anyway! I am! It's all about ME! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-19 09:01:40	@ChristenDali Miss Almond is cute! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-19 09:02:14	@claire_tulloch That's a shame! I'll be sure to tell you all about it :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-19 09:03:34	@anniesupperclub @WarbsNewburnBH Will do! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-14 10:58:20	@gfreeb Oh no! Make sure to take it easy, drink lots of fluids, bundle up in duvet if possible!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-14 13:31:19	@gfreeb @beccafetts I remember living off chocolate milk for that time... :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-21 14:41:04	@gfreeb Shouldn't have read yours - now my write-up looks crap in comparison! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-21 14:43:43	@gfreeb Yep, me too! At the moment mine kind of reads like "what I did on my summer holidays" by Samantha Stein, aged 7 1/4
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-21 15:24:45	I go behind the scenes at @WarbsNewburnBH http://t.co/in7BAnmlnC #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-21 15:31:41	@gfreeb Thanks! Well you don't go on about the tasty sandwiches as much as I did! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-21 15:39:53	@gfreeb When I contaminated the butter there was a slight panic before I realised it was ok!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-21 15:41:43	@GlutenFreeMrsD @warbsnewburnbh I can't remember whether that was all #glutenfree bread or not, but yeah.. scary!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-21 15:41:52	@GlutenFreeMrsD Thanks for RT :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-21 15:47:31	@gfreeb @GlutenFreeMrsD Agreed - think that warbies and genius do slightly better!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-21 15:51:21	@Annies_Larder @GlutenFreeMrsD @WarbsNewburnBH V interesting to read your write up!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-21 15:56:57	@Annies_Larder @GlutenFreeMrsD @WarbsNewburnBH Absolutely! Things are going in the right direction though.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-21 18:16:26	@gfcakelover @warbsnewburnbh Yeah, we had a great time! Definitely go next time if you can!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-21 18:17:01	@kgollop We had such a good time - definitely try to make it next time if you can!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-19 20:37:49	@gfreeb @GlutenFreeandGs @gffoodie @Nuala_ONeill @chrisNhook6 likewise! I had a wonderful day :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-21 21:21:14	@GluttonfrGluten Ooh, let me know how it goes - it was a lot of faff but worth it, I think!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-22 09:16:45	@claire_tulloch @WarbsNewburnBH Thanks! I don't normally eat a lot of #gf bread but I was certainly impressed by it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-22 11:20:51	Read about my trip to the #glutenfree Newburn Bakehouse! @WarbsNewburnBH http://t.co/in7BAnmlnC
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-18 10:13:50	Who else will be up in @WarbsNewburnBH tomorrow?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-18 10:35:36	@GlutenFreeMrsD @warbsnewburnbh Sad you'll be missing out! I'll be doing a full write up :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-18 11:14:36	Pizza Hut is now delivering #glutenfree pizzas in the UK! http://t.co/YSRcvLca
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-18 11:16:23	@KatieAtki That's a shame but it's a step in the right direction at least!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-18 12:35:41	Anyone know of somewhere quick, cheap &amp; #glutenfree for dinner in #Newcastle?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-18 15:36:10	Oops, gorged on Leon's fries at kings cross! #glutenfree #yum
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-22 17:55:51	Heinz breaks into the #glutenfree market http://t.co/hA1Q8y2SFA
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-21 14:36:12	Have written 1500 words and counting about my trip to @WarbsNewburnBH ... think I should stop soon!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-21 14:45:08	@gfreeb I know! Taking pictures of signs etc ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-22 22:12:35	@Annies_Larder Oh, I didn't know that! Weird that they've chosen pasta, when it's one of the easier things to get hold of #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-26 16:22:40	My entry to the @SainsburysPR #RNDcookies challenge! http://t.co/zK4adFBSM2 #glutenfree

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-27 12:21:58	@IsabelsCuisine @SainsburysPR Thank you! (I did have a bit of help from my steady-handed boyfriend!) ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-27 13:00:04	@Coeliac_UK @gfreeb @fluffywelshshee Certainly count me in!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-27 13:00:54	@IsabelsCuisine I certainly am :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 09:57:16	Dear @UKTesco , it's over. From a #glutenfree customer. http://t.co/WZUViYaJP2
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 10:10:21	@aw4268 Totally agree with you!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 10:52:56	@UKTesco This was in the New Malden Tesco Extra and you can stock your shelves with what you say you stock! Full shelves are all we want!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 11:30:40	Help @gfreeb get to 500 followers!! #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 11:51:30	@HaleHeartyFoods I think I just was! \o/
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 11:58:35	Me, today: http://t.co/b1L05RXIeQ #glutenfree #coeliac
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 11:59:47	@freefromfairy We'll see if anything actually changes though... talk is cheap
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 12:26:48	I made a tumblr, hoping to get people to submit photos/stories of empty #freefrom shelves! http://t.co/HnS5eyrEzd
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 12:41:26	Any #glutenfree people who want to help me with #emptyfreefromshelves? I'm so new to tumblr it hurts... http://t.co/HnS5eyrEzd
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 12:43:44	@gfreeb @Coeliac_UK I just want everyone to be as noisy as possible about this now, so hopefully that will help them!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 13:15:55	@lovelactosefree Do feel free to submit your gripes anyway - really trying to make the supermarkets sit up and listen now - SO fed up!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 14:56:06	666 followers! Clearly I am tweeting from the devil today ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 15:11:32	Never ever using red food dye again after today's Red Nose Day cookie bloodbath.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 15:51:55	@beccafetts Generic "sorry about this, we'll look into it"... to be expected!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 17:49:11	Great article on what really causes #coeliac disease: http://t.co/FBQsAJbSC8
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 18:24:17	Because it went down such a treat this morning: Tesco, it's over. From a #glutenfree customer http://t.co/WZUViYaJP2
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 18:32:48	Thanks for all your tweets coming in re: empty shelves in supermarkets. It's clear that this is a big deal for all of us! #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-02-25 19:03:22	@Alice_Reeves Hooray! Thank you! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-01 22:38:55	@CupcakeCornerUK @gfreeb Just added this one, is there another?

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-03 09:24:22	@david_navigator I thought they already apply? Or have I missed some new legislation?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-03 09:25:28	@FoodAllergyAwar Ah, that's so annoying!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-03 09:27:06	@WFM_Kensington It was in the bulk section. If a problem w/ x-contamination, why did the polenta sticker not say so? http://t.co/NwExscS0NY
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-03 09:33:29	@lorrainepascale Sounds great! I've asked for more info - would love to represent the gluten-free community! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-03 09:53:21	@david_navigator Thanks - I'll read up on it. Seems like they will have to make quite the effort!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-03 09:54:35	@gfcakelover Thanks :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-03 10:07:54	@claire_tulloch Hehe, glad you enjoyed it :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-03 20:02:08	@GFT_Gb If everyone had to be a coeliac for a day I think things would be very different!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-01 17:53:31	Today, I splurged at @WFM_Kensington and bought coconut flour! What should I make with it? #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-01 18:45:24	@WFM_Kensington Thank you!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-01 22:47:45	@CupcakeCornerUK No, but at least it's the better way round - I hate it when you can't buy plain flour -at least u can add baking powder
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-02 08:57:08	@WFM_Kensington I know my way around the store by now! ;) But just checked my buckwheat flakes (loose) - do they really contain gluten?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-02 11:38:31	@WFM_Kensington That's what I thought but the label says "Allergens: gluten"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-02 11:39:47	Having a lazy Saturday after a pretty stressful week, wondering whether I should go strawberry blonde. Yea or nay? http://t.co/f2Lh22i77q
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-04 09:47:45	@WFM_Kensington No problem! :) Thanks for checking!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-07 10:03:22	@TheLookOutBB Sounds awesome! I may have to make a trip down there sometime soon... :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-11 12:13:45	@wetherbywhaler Does Wakefield have one?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-11 12:15:59	@wetherbywhaler Great thanks! :) Was really delicious.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-11 16:55:39	The "calorie neutral" restaurant - pretty much my idea of hell: http://t.co/UbsuW1YOPT
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-11 17:02:09	@wbites Not to mention the whole idea of "working off" your dinner is just wrong! Gah! http://t.co/NAmQsn8jL5
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-11 17:05:43	@GFBitesUK @wetherbywhaler They were delicious! Have you been to the Seine Rigger. It's SW London (sort of)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-11 21:08:29	@freefromfairy @wetherbywhaler @Coeliac_UK I haven't tried it (I assumed malt vinegar was a nono, but may look into it now!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-12 13:15:15	@jasmineeec glad you like it :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-08 10:01:28	Looking forward to #glutenfree fish &amp; chips at the @wetherbywhaler tonight! Scrummy!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-08 10:04:10	@IsabelsCuisine Thanks! I'm up your way this weekend - off for a #gf fish&amp;chips at the wetherby whaler this evening :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-08 10:42:43	@IsabelsCuisine Haha - visiting the in-laws this weekend ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-12 16:58:59	@gffoodie @GlutenFreeMrsD @gfreeb Yes! I was wondering about this just this morning... hope all's well xx

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-14 12:50:33	@gfreeb I saw that a few days ago - very tempted to get it! Apparently it's well worth it.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-14 12:51:49	@gfreeb I don't really run but maybe this will help??
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-11 11:52:13	@wetherbywhaler Is there a #glutenfree fryer in all branches or just the guiseley one? Just writing up my review of Saturday's lunch!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-11 12:20:01	@wetherbywhaler Ok, brilliant! (Just wanted to get all my facts straight)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-14 18:22:25	@wbites @gfreeb Woop! And I've added you, thanks for reminding :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-15 09:58:14	@WarbsNewburnBH launches #glutenfree wraps! I review them here: http://t.co/SjaPjHTiWf #saveourwraps
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-15 10:39:08	@EmmaDallos I absolutely loved the wraps - you won't be disappointed! @warbsnewburnbh do you know if they are in all Tesco branches?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-15 10:43:12	@APinchOfFolie Eat pizza! There are so many #glutenfree options available now! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-15 10:44:22	@APinchOfFolie Do you have any other allergys/intolerances or is it just gluten?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-15 10:51:14	@APinchOfFolie It can be tricky as many bases contain milk, have you tried using @Dovesfarm gf bread flour to make the base?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-15 10:57:02	@APinchOfFolie The dominos #glutenfree base does appear to be dairy free as well - so you could order it without cheese?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-15 11:00:48	@APinchOfFolie @Dovesfarm It's a very respectable mix and useful if you're dealing with #dairyfree as well. Depends on what you're making!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-15 12:58:03	@over_dramatic87 @gfreeb @hungryboyfriend @wbites @coeliacme Thanks, have a great weekend! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-15 14:06:57	@chrisNhook6 @warbsnewburnbh It was fantastic - honestly one of those "Can't believe it's #glutenfree" moments! Well done all :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-17 16:53:21	Is there actually any fun to St Paddys Day if you don't drink beer? :P

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 12:51:20	@VikkiLiane Thanks :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 14:10:15	@wbites @gfreeb @coeliacme @kgollop @noomie82 I guess they are constantly working to one-up each other! Good for us - means more choice!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-18 09:04:26	@coeliacme Bahaha. I've been getting really into Crabbies ginger beer recently since most ciders on sale in pubs are horribly sweet!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-18 09:04:44	@Fizza09 Oh no, poor you!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-18 09:05:24	@RuthLTurner I have come to the conclusion it's little more than another excuse to drink for most people! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-18 09:07:42	Today marks my 2 year "glutaversary" - how should I celebrate? :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-18 17:28:14	@gfreeb Nerd fitness is good, if slightly strength training obsessed. Not female-oriented but more mixed than it could be.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-18 17:31:05	@gfreeb Muscle building seems to be a sensible idea as it means you can pretty much eat what you want and just not think about weight.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-18 17:32:21	@gfreeb Ha! Think this article might appeal! http://t.co/4EEap6GMNB
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 15:09:59	@freefromfairy You're welcome :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 16:19:17	In case you missed it, my rant about ignorant #glutenfree comments on ITV last night http://t.co/KkpJU8ox6n
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 16:23:15	@coeliacme @wbites Sounds delicious!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 16:30:10	@david_navigator @Stacie_bakes @stacie_stewart Nope
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 16:34:36	@GlutenFreeMrsD @stacie_stewart @GloriousFoodTV No but FGF's Facebook page is pretty entertaining reading...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 17:29:15	Sooo tired - think I'm gonna see if I can find some #gf junk food in the supermarket for dinner tonight #lazycoeliac
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 17:38:57	@ZenHarmony Certainly very ignorant and ill-informed!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 17:46:12	@bellasbakeryUK Haha! Send them to meeeeeeee :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 17:52:08	@bellasbakeryUK You mean flavour free? ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 17:53:16	@bellasbakeryUK Wow, your cakes look amazing! Maybe one day you could do me a wedding cake :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 18:31:22	@KayleiKakes Haha! I am completely the opposite so it feels like a shock to realise "wait, I don't have to cook??"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 18:31:58	@happygoluckycat Thanks. Not sure what else I can do except blog though :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 18:35:08	@GlutenFree_dom So far I've got an oven pizza and some mini eggs! #success
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 18:36:26	@GlutenFree_dom It's one of the DS italian pizzas.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 19:03:09	Lots of unhappy coeliacs due to #toiletgate... https://t.co/jerCfqB2k9
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 19:12:54	@KayleiKakes Go for it! :) I love eating and cooking!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 20:35:13	@77mollie Exactly! Especially when we can make delicious ones which won't make us ill! I don't miss those days of pain.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 20:45:47	@77mollie Wouldn't it be ironic if she turned out to be an undiagnosed 1 in 100? ;) Bet she'd change her tune!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-18 10:10:37	@Fizza09 That's awful! Make sure you tell them!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-19 12:33:57	@DevereuxEm I'm planning on blogging a lot out there! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-19 12:34:10	@chrisburgessuk Thanks - I'll have to check them both out! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-19 12:34:41	@GlutenFreeMrsD Any recommendations? :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-19 08:58:23	@wbites @coeliacme @downwithgluten @gfreeb Seconded :) I need to update my links section too...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-19 09:34:29	I'm getting all excited and nervous about headed to New York next week... gonna be a foodie paradise!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-19 14:32:52	@GlutenFreeMrsD Thanks :) Just been reading your BA/AA meal posts - I'm going Virgin and hoping that my meal is ok!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-19 16:11:56	@TheColinWoodley @noomie82 @beglutenfreeB I certainly have, see review here: http://t.co/SjaPjHTiWf :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-19 16:16:53	@TheColinWoodley @noomie82 @beglutenfreeB Oh dear! But that's a good sign, right? That people are buying them?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-19 16:46:56	@wbites This is my one being super clever: https://t.co/sHg2POpGQN
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-19 16:48:07	@wbites But this is my absolute favourite video of my little Storm as a kitten: https://t.co/xDaE00YI0b :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 20:46:25	@77mollie And agreed, I'd rather go without cupcakes entirely than suffer like that again. Health trumps sweet treats.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 20:49:55	@77mollie Me too! Puff pastry, decent bagels, soft pretzels, challah - yum! One day soon though... fingers crossed
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 21:05:21	@GF_All_The_Way Looks yummy!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 21:32:00	@gfandfabulous Safest place I know is @BruschettaGF but it's about 25 mins by train out of London (Kingston way). Super delicious pizza.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 21:34:07	@gfandfabulous @bruschettagf Then you DEFINITELY have to swing by Bruschetta! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 21:58:55	For those who still haven't heard about #toiletgate here's my rant about awful #glutenfree comments on ITV http://t.co/KkpJU8ox6n
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-19 18:41:32	@cocorosey @wbites Aww! Cats for everyone! :-D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 23:10:50	Thank u all muchly for the RTs, comments &amp; complaints to Ofcom re: the ignorant comments about #glutenfree food made on itv last night
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 08:47:07	@rarrr27 I think there were veggie options as long as you're ok with cheese? Have a great time! :D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-21 10:02:52	@wbites @coeliacme @stacie_stewart @GloriousFoodTV Just watched the offending bit and my mouth fell open. I sense an angry blog post...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-20 13:45:02	@gfreeb Oh go on, be a busybody! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-20 13:48:01	@gfreeb How about a long rant about the etymology of the word "gluten" as compared to "glutinous"?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-20 13:48:38	@gfreeb Sometimes I wish I had an airhorn for people like that, so when they say something stupid it's just like "MEEEEEEEERRRR"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-20 13:50:27	@gfreeb @wbites I think I had a reputation for being a know-it-all at the last place I worked... it can be lonely but at least you're right!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-20 15:24:38	@wbites @gfreeb Usually asked right after you've explained that it's mostly wheat you have to avoid...

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-22 17:27:07	@Ali_Huck @wbites Thanks :) One step at a time...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-22 17:27:26	@antony_bennett @coeliacme It's awful, I couldn't believe it when I heard!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-22 17:27:52	@coeliacme Hehe, I normally hate everything being called -gate so it's with tongue firmly in cheek! :P

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-22 17:28:24	@downwithgluten Thanks :) Have a great weekend
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-22 17:29:04	@gfandfabulous @BruschettaGF Oh, you'll love it! Don't forget starters, dessert and garlic bread (w/ cheese is my fave) ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-22 17:30:01	@janekyriacou The reign of Simon Cowell's shows must come to an end soon - we are desperate for some new ideas, some creativity!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-22 17:30:31	@SophieSherran I know, it's frustrating isn't it? All I can do sometimes is rant though! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-22 17:37:44	@Debbieb1979 Thx 4 blog-love. Maybe one day I'll make it on TV as the Angry &amp; Pedantic Coeliac ;) There's a market for allergy cooking shows
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-22 18:56:45	@TheColinWoodley @wbites Absolutely. Probably easier to teach that you can't believe what you hear on TV!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-24 16:57:48	@GlutenFree_dom I don't have a recipe, but @GlutenFreeMrsD found some in Cornwall! http://t.co/94mKw9TuZS
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 09:45:57	New York tomorrow New York tomorroww aaaaaah so excited!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 09:49:26	@wbites I thought I was the only one!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 09:51:33	@GlutenFreeMrsD Hey, no probs you are high up on google search for "gluten-free cornish pasties"! ;) Btw im off to NY tomo, recommendations?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 09:56:30	@GlutenFreeMrsD Np, I'm there for 2 weeks so no rush, my friend knows lots of #gf friendly places, so really excited to stuff my face! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 10:01:20	@GlutenFreeMrsD W/ my friend close to NYU (Midtown, I guess). It's also my first ever gluten-free airline meal (Virgin) - something to dread
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 10:07:18	@glutenfreeadele Thanks, I will! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 10:08:24	@GlutenFreeMrsD It's been on every correspondance thats come through from them so far! Really convenient that it's there when you book.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 10:08:41	@daveboy79 Thank you!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 10:10:21	@noomie82 Any #gf recommendations? (Or must-see attractions?) Last time I went I was not #glutenfree (I was ill instead!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 10:25:05	@barmycakes @noomie82 Yes, can't wait to go to @JWayBakeryNYC !!! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 10:48:24	@gfreeb Are we talking about something to do with a Ms Paltrow?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 10:48:49	@bellasbakeryUK @glutenfreemrsd I can't wait! Haven't seen my friend in 4 years - about time too!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 10:51:30	@gfreeb Ever since the Camp Quest media debacle of 2009 I've boycotted them - good to know they haven't changed!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 10:55:23	@WeTravelGF Thanks! Is this the right place? http://t.co/UA1B12lroh
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 11:02:45	@chrisburgessuk Thanks for the recs! Looks like I'll be spending my whole time there eating and blogging! (Hopefully walking it off!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 11:04:46	@GlutenFreeRosie Will do!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 11:34:36	@gfreeb Just read the full article - what an annoying woman. Although I understand Gwyneth eats gf because her husband is gluten intolerant?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 11:38:55	@gfreeb I consider "clean" food as simply food that I can eat without bloating. But my "clean" food may differ from others.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 11:42:29	@gfreeb Yeah, exactly. Although modern wheat has a v high level of gluten in it (from what Ive read) - not convinced it's great 4 anyone
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 11:42:49	@gfreeb Gluten-free bread = not a health food.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 11:43:31	@gfreeb AFAIK wheat has been bred over the last few decades to get high gluten yield which may be cause for surge in gluten problems.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 11:48:11	@gfreeb Ah, good to know!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 11:56:45	Food Glorious Food have responded to the angry #coeliacs bearing pitchforks: http://t.co/ovs95UKPIy
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 11:57:30	@gfreeb Pass... I think its the same as hanged/hung, can never remember which to use which in!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 12:02:50	@Miko100 @gfreeb Ha! Yeah, most people buying gluten-free bread are not #coeliacs. Without them, we wouldn't have the choice we have!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 12:03:46	@TheColinWoodley No I didn't!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 12:05:23	@WeTravelGF Perfect! Am looking forward to trying them!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 12:09:54	@TheColinWoodley I had to read that several times before I understood it. What an odd person she must be. She prob thinks same of me!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 12:19:07	@TheColinWoodley What were you asking dominos about?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 12:21:43	@Miko100 @gfreeb I actually support "faddy eaters" but oppose misinformation about the gf diet. If it's a fad, it will soon pass.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 12:23:13	@Miko100 @gfreeb In principle I support people's right to eat however they like, but they should not be given a platform to spout nonsense.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 12:26:22	@TheColinWoodley @wbites That's a shame - although likely to be miscommunication throughout the company!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 12:27:41	@Miko100 @gfreeb #glutenfree is just one part of the anti-carb movement of our generation. Like the anti-fat and anti-protein before that...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 12:48:41	@coeliacme Glad to see #toiletgate is catching on ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 13:39:38	@coeliacme haha! I had to restrain myself from using naughty words... :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 15:22:53	New post: preparing for a trip to #newyork http://t.co/S66BLhmljg

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 15:47:25	@happywombelle @wbites I'll try my hardest to eat as much as possible then! In the interests of my blog readers... ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-25 15:48:52	@AntoinettesBake @BabyCakesNYC Ooh, I shall do!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-29 12:41:08	Yesterday I went to @tulusbakery @JWayBakeryNYC and @eatSMAC - all absolutely delicious and #glutenfree! Reviews to follow :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-31 13:57:22	@eatSMAC Thanks 4 the follow - I may have to come back to S'MAC several times before I leave to give an accurate review! ;) yum #glutenfree

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-30 02:58:13	Browsing Strand books this avo &amp; bought "Against the Grain" (1995) - has a ridiculous amount of misinformation about #gluten - what to do?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-27 14:31:52	The variety of #glutenfree products available in the USA puts the UK to shame. Currently enjoying a normal sized "everything" bagel!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-03-27 14:40:23	@david_navigator Expensive! But then again I was in Whole Foods.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-02 14:32:19	Going to Lilli and Loo for lunch today - #glutenfree Chinese/Asian/Sushi place!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-03 22:03:27	@LunaandLarrys I'm sure @WFM_Kensington would love to stock it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-03 22:04:26	@baileybiggar There shouldnt be malt barley in any sushi (!) but some will contain soy sauce. I tend to stay away from supermarket sushi
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-02 21:45:29	@ContextLondon Near the south east corner of Central Park in NY
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-03 01:04:11	@LunaandLarrys Just tried your ginger cookie caramel - PLEASE make your products available in the UK! Love it! #glutenfree

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-03 22:00:12	@WensleyHeifer What's the other 5%? ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-07 22:20:23	@GlutenFreeMrsD Had #glutenfree brunch at Friedman's - amazing! Thx for recommending :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-06 20:10:37	New post! Review of Lilli and Loo, New York #glutenfree #chinese http://t.co/71wPrO3fPU
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-06 20:11:03	@beccafetts It was amazing! I'm still wondering if I can fit in a third trip before I leave...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-07 01:22:49	@gfcuppatea You're welcome! Epic is definitely the word to describe it! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-08 14:15:24	@GlutenFreeMrsD Great thanks! Last day today - going to try risotteria! So many #glutenfree places to write about!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-12 14:17:46	Everyone, please stop with the #glutenfree #gwyneth nonsense http://t.co/RpD6xhgvFs
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-12 14:43:11	@gfandfabulous I know the best thing to do is probaly ignore it all... but it's so hard sometimes!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-12 20:43:34	@gfreeb @happywombelle Got loads of recommendations - just need to write up all the reviews! :) Where in NY will you be?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-12 20:47:06	@wbites @vwlou @freefromfairy @lovelactosefree @coeliacme @gfcakelover @kgollop @gfreeb @TheGlutenBaby Have a great weekend all! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-12 20:48:02	@happywombelle @gfreeb Is it S'Mac? I went there twice it was so good!!! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-11 14:03:47	Cheering myself up on the tail end of a glutening by buying organisational items aplenty! New tea towels, wire racks, recycle bin!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-11 18:34:02	Unfortunately I'm still ill, tired, jetlagged but I'll be back to posting very soon - plenty of #glutenfree restaurants from NYC to review!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-15 12:17:05	Experimenting with taro for lunch. Anyone tried it? #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-15 12:32:38	@gfreeb They sell it fresh and frozen in my local korean supermarket! (not much help to you though - maybe try a chinese supermarket?)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-15 12:33:02	@RuthLTurner Sort of like potato: http://t.co/5BI99meMGy
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-15 12:36:56	@RuthLTurner Actually quite tasty - although some people have said it's an "acquired" taste - I think it's quite pleasant.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-15 13:33:10	New post! Review of @eatSMAC #glutenfree Mac &amp; Cheese in #NewYork! Yum yum http://t.co/ytffIK22bm
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-15 14:38:18	One of my friends has just been diagnosed #coeliac - feel really bad for her, wouldn't wish it on anyone else :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-15 14:53:43	@Glutenpedia Oh absolutely! I wish I'd had a friend when I started out! Also, the doc didn't say to keep eating gluten for the biopsy! D'oh
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-15 20:36:30	@GlutenFreeWoman That would be brilliant - already looking forward to trying buckwheat porridge and polenta in it! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-15 17:00:35	Finally bought a rice cooker... my slow cooker now has a friend! #glutenfree gadgets unite http://t.co/VsFFTL41pr
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-15 17:01:18	@kgollop I'm hoping to test out my upcoming book on her... ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-15 17:07:16	@wbites Not yet - any thoughts? :P I assume from your question that you have names for yours?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-16 09:42:41	Buckwheat porridge in a rice cooker = success! Best £15.99 I ever spent
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-17 11:47:47	I just sneezed and my trousers ripped. I think that's when you know you have to lose some weight! oops
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-17 11:55:16	@GlutenFreeMrsD Yes! Luckily it wasn't a gaping hole, just a big ripping sound and I can't find the source...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-17 12:49:16	@wbites @GlutenFreeMrsD Have you considered AirBNB? For £100 you can get some great places
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-17 16:05:48	@wbites @GlutenFreeMrsD There's always http://t.co/Nx5b94Cas0 - I used them when going to the Canaries
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-22 09:55:13	@KayleiKakes @gfcakelover @GFJenna @itsgottobegf No but only because I'm not very keen on #gf bread! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-22 21:15:27	#glutenfree pizza at @PizzaExpress ? Yes please! :-)  #pizzaexpressglutenfree http://t.co/tR79awiKpd
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-22 21:23:30	@coeliacme @DavidJ_GF had a great evening, hope to chat properly soon! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-22 21:25:53	@PizzaExpress  thanks for a great evening &amp; good luck with the launch. You've done a great job, you should all be very proud :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-22 21:37:14	@x_KatieDay_x @PizzaExpress from april 30th :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-22 21:38:54	@happywombelle @PizzaExpress sure does!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-22 21:41:04	Turns out I CAN be bought with a free dinner and a goodie bag...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-22 21:44:19	@MissWeston100 @PizzaExpress its certainly one of the best on the high street! And they are so passionate about it :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-22 21:48:32	@bellasbakeryUK @PizzaExpress yes they are!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-22 21:50:50	@bellasbakeryUK @PizzaExpress you dont have long to wait! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-22 22:24:01	@LaPetiteFoy @PizzaExpress All flour used in restaurants for rolling etc is now #gf - they have put many processes in place to ensure safety
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 06:15:23	@Nuala_ONeill @gfreeb @GlutenFreek @DavidJ_GF delicious! One of the better bases on the high street IMO.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 07:56:36	@GlutenFreeMrsD @Nuala_ONeill @gfreeb @GlutenFreek @DavidJ_GF somewhere in between? A thin crust with a bit of bite
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 07:58:16	@GlutenFreeMrsD @Nuala_ONeill @gfreeb exhibit a http://t.co/GBWMidNHpC
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 08:35:31	@jamesentwistle @GlutenFreeMrsD @Nuala_ONeill @gfreeb It's 11" which I think is the same as their classic base. Also a 7" for kids
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 11:35:42	Interesting... Jamie's Italian pleads guilty to serving regular pasta to a #coeliac http://t.co/IyBK2i6sqN
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 16:10:53	This #pizzaexpressglutenfree post has taken me the better part of 2 hours to write - you guys better read and retweet it! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 16:12:18	@coeliacme may have to give a tl;dr version at the bottom.... :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 16:21:11	@jamesentwistle @wbites Oh yeah guys, this is TOTALLY helping :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 16:29:58	@PizzaExpress to offer #glutenfree range from April 30th! #pizzaexpressglutenfree http://t.co/h272I64TJQ
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 16:30:11	@jamesentwistle @wbites Go on then, what are you waiting for?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 16:36:32	@jamesentwistle Aww thanks! Yeah, was my first time trying the beer - may be a convert!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 16:46:30	@wbites @PizzaExpress Thanks :) I was getting hungry writing it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 17:03:45	@barmycakes @pizzaexpress Haha! Good luck explaining that she'll have to wait A WHOLE WEEK! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 17:12:33	@bellasbakeryUK Thanks :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 17:15:14	@bellasbakeryUK @PizzaExpress Ain't nobody got time for small pizzas
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 17:28:43	@noomie82 @wbites @coeliacme Deliciousness and yum are what's in it.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 20:02:57	@p4ula1 You'll have a great time. Not haute cuisine, but good food and good atmosphere :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 20:04:03	@noomie82 @wbites @coeliacme Buy some? Make it yourself! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 20:04:48	@EmmaDallos @pizzaexpress Me too, I used to love PE - and I guess I'll have to rekindle that love affair now :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 20:05:15	@coeliacme Full belly achieved!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 20:05:45	@gfdining Thanks :))
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 20:21:19	@noomie82 @wbites @coeliacme Put in bowl. Stir. Serve. :P http://t.co/GZouOiS0aj
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-23 20:21:53	@noomie82 @wbites @coeliacme Definitely no need to deseed the cucumber, geesh!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-24 08:56:18	Great article about being the parent of a child with food allergies: http://t.co/Wn0gOpUAMy
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-24 14:54:13	If you've never tried Dak Galbi and live near a Korean/Chinese/Asian supermarket, give it a go! #glutenfree http://t.co/cPFTJTh3Us
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 09:28:38	Off to see 'Whats Cooking?' being filmed so making an epic trek across london!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 15:02:14	@wbites probably took me longer to get across london than it would for you to get TO london :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 16:22:37	Only 5 days until @PizzaExpress launches its #glutenfree range! http://t.co/h272I64TJQ
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 16:27:34	Many thanks to @SainsburysPR for allowing me to watch the filming of today's @whatscookingtv w/ @rachelallen1 - was really interesting!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 16:41:53	I have a confession to make. I am totally addicted to mochi. Have just eaten an entire box of peanut butter mochi &amp; I'm not even sorry.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 16:49:40	@david_navigator @gfreeb @wbites We don't need to communicate with local restaurants over twitter, that's why :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 17:01:18	@TheLauristonPub Are your #glutenfree pizzas suitable for #coeliacs? I can't find any mention of #gf on your menu.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 17:02:38	@TheLauristonPub @TheRegentPub @TheHanburyArms I'm clearly the wrong end of London :'(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 17:42:11	After years of disliking beer bc I associate it with pain, I'm actually becoming a bit of a fan of @GlutenFreeBeer !
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 18:12:49	@david_navigator @wbites @CELIAlager @GlutenFreeBeer Green's do a dark ale, if thats what you mean
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 18:13:15	@gfreeb slurp! Which brand of beer?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 18:15:22	@david_navigator @CELIAlager @GlutenFreeBeer @wbites http://t.co/2I0BgVRy6u Plenty to choose from...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-26 07:19:16	@peteralee Yes, it will be all branches.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 16:29:50	@gfreeb No, it's filmed out near Barking. 3 hour round trip in London = not fun
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 16:31:42	DITTO! RT @gfreeb: Dear @gbkburgers, please can we have #glutenfree buns with our burgers? http://t.co/dEOIzfaWnh #NoBunNoFun
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 16:32:06	DITTO! RT @gfreeb: Dear @wagamama_uk, please can you improve your #glutenfree options? http://t.co/dEOIzfaWnh
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 16:37:56	@baileybiggar Whoo! Great hashtag! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 16:51:21	@david_navigator @gfreeb @wbites Also, badgering chains is useful for when you're out &amp; about or dont know the area.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 16:53:56	@wbites @david_navigator @gfreeb Link?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-25 16:58:32	@TheLauristonPub Yum yum! But you are so far away :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-26 08:08:09	Should FINALLY be finished painting today and then can put our #glutenfree guest bedroom on airbnb :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-26 10:03:16	@coeliacme She's been desperate to get in the room all week - we've mostly avoided disaster so far! Glossing may be a problem...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-28 13:10:11	Need a place to stay in London that's #glutenfree friendly? Fancy being hosted by The Happy Coeliac herself? https://t.co/Y4fbnYNiwF
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-28 13:11:47	@CupcakeCornerUK Maybe I should offer free #gf cake with every stay! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-28 14:13:24	@kenscheer Yeah not bad! Working on new ebook atm, hope to get it out by early June! How are things with you? :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-28 14:20:35	@kenscheer And you are more than welcome at Hotel Happy Coeliac when you return :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-26 07:19:55	@freefromfairy @kgollop @wbites @HealthJourno @AmeliesLarder @NoSugarBunFairy @GFShoestring @coeliacme Thanks, enjoy the (rainy?) weekend!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-26 09:52:19	Trying to get paint off a cat's tail is harder than it sounds. Luckily it's water soluble... :S
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-26 10:01:13	@coeliacme I managed to get the paint off her but now will have to redo the wall where she brushed against it. Damn and blast.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-26 10:01:57	@david_navigator Was sufficient to use a wet cloth. She's too fiesty to be held still for a "real" bath! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-26 10:09:10	@stace8383 Yeah, she's much less hassle without that pesky tail :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-29 12:28:06	@PizzaExpress launch their #glutenfree offerings TOMORROW! Squeeeeee http://t.co/h272I64TJQ
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-29 13:36:01	@LauraTurnbull92 @PizzaExpress I believe the risotto is vegetarian, unless ur concerned about the suffering of innocent butternut squash :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-29 13:36:48	@PizzaExpress Well, glad to hear you're spreading the #glutenfree pizza! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-29 14:00:40	@coeliacme They are relying on people writing to them?!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-29 14:02:45	@LauraTurnbull92 @PizzaExpress Oh sorry, I didn't know that! Didn't mean to be flippant! There are some salads that might do for starters.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-29 14:03:18	@LauraTurnbull92 @PizzaExpress But agreed there isn't a huge selection, but PE will expand the line if popular. So send them your feedback!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-29 14:08:42	@LauraTurnbull92 Double checked and the cheese IN it is gorgonzola - I believe that the parmesan is a topping that you could ask without.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-29 14:19:24	@coeliacme @david_navigator I wonder why they dont simply look to the success of #gf in european mcd's??
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-30 07:56:53	@cerikitchen Congrats! My two year blogaversary is on Friday :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-30 08:38:31	Super-pimping my #glutenfree cornbread recipe with quinoa flour... results imminent
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-30 10:02:01	#glutenfree scones anyone? Really simple &amp; quick and great if you have loads of #gf flours lying around anyway... http://t.co/ZsG475F2BH
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-30 11:24:03	If I were to start making #glutenfree videos, what sort of things would you want to see? Instructional/ranty/reviews?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-30 12:19:55	I wish #glutenfree producers would stop relying so heavily on rice/potato flour. So many other #gf flours are much nicer!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-30 12:32:48	@louisetalks It depends on the type of bread you are going for as different flours have different properties.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-30 12:33:56	@louisetalks The problem with #gf is there isn't one magic flour - you have to work out blends etc. This may help: http://t.co/VBE3uwtEXt
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-30 13:57:52	@david_navigator @gfreeb omnomnom! Looks like we're on the same sconelength.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-30 14:10:55	@gfreeb If you have the cornmeal you could sub another flour - which are you missing?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-30 14:27:17	@gfreeb You can get fine or coarse cornmeal - I think I have the fine stuff and it wasn't too gritty. But then again I do like cornmeal ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-30 17:45:09	@tweetingeli Cool, thanks for the idea! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-30 17:54:04	@gfreeb Think #gf accreditation is on its way but menus were printed when only NGCI
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-04-27 08:56:47	It's #gftweetup time today! :D :D :D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-01 19:59:32	@gfreeb Very impressed!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-03 12:49:36	@honeybunsbakery Thanks, your lemon drizzle cake turned out beautifully! #glutenfree http://t.co/er29ZLMGqZ
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-03 12:51:33	Happy 2nd Blogaversary to me! :-) My wish is... CAKE! http://t.co/7UFMxWJYCa
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-03 12:54:57	@kgollop @noomie82 yes I saw, thank you :-) Glad you enjoyed the pizza, I'm craving it now!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-03 12:55:49	@kgollop Thanks! :-) Can't believe I let my bf take the rest of the cake into work... regretting that now!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-03 13:00:32	@kgollop I'm going through a mad lemon/lime phase! I guess that's summer calling! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-03 13:37:32	@kenscheer Thanks - it's at Risotteria in NYC :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-03 15:25:03	@honeybunsbakery Really looking forward to the #glutenfree custard creams! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-03 15:28:31	@wbites Have you blogged it? How did the biscuits come out, crispy or chewier?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-03 15:47:49	@wbites YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE FILLING?!! I don't think we can be friends anymore... :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-03 16:12:59	@wbites OK, I'll let you off... for now :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-03 16:28:42	@coeliacme So assemble and then nom immediately? Can do! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-01 11:55:20	Are there any specific nutrients in whole grains that cannot be got from any other source?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-01 13:44:51	@gfwanderer I didn't try anything savoury - I'm kicking myself now!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-02 16:23:05	Baking a @HoneybunsBakery lemon drizzle cake for my blog's birthday tomorrow! They grow up so fast...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-04 10:30:17	New post! Review of Risotteria in New York #glutenfree http://t.co/sGxOf6SQUa
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-03 06:37:03	@Miko100 :-) go forth and eat pizza!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-08 18:14:27	Twitter's been a bit quiet this week! Was it something I said? :'(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-10 09:43:56	@coeliac_uk 's "Gut Feeling Week" starts on Monday! http://t.co/UFpTiWHY5S
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-10 09:50:01	@coeliac_uk Absolutely! How many words roughly?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-10 10:01:55	@coeliac_uk Sure - I wasn't sure whether you meant on my blog or yours! I'll schedule something to be published next week. :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-10 10:04:26	@coeliac_uk And congrats on all your fantastic #gutfeeling work! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-10 12:09:05	@glutenfreek Great post :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-10 12:27:24	It's good that orthopaedic swedish clogs are currently in fashion since all other summer shoes create agony... http://t.co/nvPGULWlTE
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-10 13:16:59	@gfreeb Great post, I do enjoy a good pun in the title :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-10 13:20:06	#gutfeeling week is coming up this Monday. Help spread the word about #coeliac disease http://t.co/nR9RhUGW2V
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-10 14:33:21	@daveboy79 Thanks for RT :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-10 14:43:11	It's Friday. I'm hungry. Let's bake #glutenfree cookies. WHO'S WITH ME???
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-10 15:08:59	@amyleger We are quoted 1 in 100 from the relevant authorities here. (UK)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 09:42:48	Has anyone tried 5:2 diet &amp; how did it go? Interested in more long term benefits (ie preventative) than just weight loss.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 09:56:55	@gfreeb Yes, I imagine it won't work as a weight loss tool if you overeat on other days
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 09:57:28	@gfreeb But supposed to be psychologically easier than obsessing about calories every day?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 09:58:32	@gfreeb Are you talking about the Moseley book? Yeah, apparently it's crap but recent studies have been promising.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 09:59:48	@david_navigator @gfreeb The fast days are 500 cals for women, 600 for men. So you can eat 2 tiny meals, basically.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 10:06:37	@gfreeb @david_navigator Yeah, but being doable is probably the most important part in any diet, I'd imagine
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 10:07:08	@david_navigator @gfreeb Allegedly eat &amp; exercise normally the other days &amp; don't calorie count too much.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 10:08:35	@david_navigator @gfreeb Personally I'm interesting in trying for a bit of both, probably too complicated to explain on twitter!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 10:10:36	@gfreeb Yes please! I stumbled across this which has data from over 1500 people now. Not science, but interesting. http://t.co/aYxwUrfgGD
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 10:12:48	@david_navigator @gfreeb I think it's probably about your approach then :P Allegedly helps control appetite on non-fast days.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 10:15:53	@gfreeb Great post. I get carb cravings all the time (eating normally) &amp; wonder whether related to fam history of type 2 (I have the gene)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 10:32:50	@david_navigator @gfreeb for me having last nights leftovers for lunch is surefire way to gain weight. Am 5'4, DO NOT NEED SO MUCH FOOD! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 13:39:24	@noomie82 This was in my browsing history so I guess its the one! ;) http://t.co/2DQDlxpJYc
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 14:07:06	@noomie82 yum yum! Now I want some...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 15:10:59	@chuchibum @em_pants How are they getting on?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 15:42:27	@em_pants @chuchibum Was ok until about 3pm today now finding it tough (looking at recipes all day doesn't help!!!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-09 16:15:27	@em_pants I think if I drink anymore bloody green tea I'll dissolve! Perhaps I just need to work on distraction.. :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-08 08:02:46	In case your Wednesday isn't going well, here's a video of a baby duck: http://t.co/fOjSBBTz0F
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-12 09:58:31	Yummy #glutenfree Sunday brunch http://t.co/v0YG9IYaqo
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-15 07:43:51	@wbites Yeah, no chance of decent photos in my house right now - it's so dark! Still, I have a huge backlog of posts so best get writing!!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-15 07:44:10	@lovelactosefree @wbites Indeed, intriguing!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-15 09:03:25	Well that's really useful, thanks. http://t.co/RSV17NygW1 #shouldhavereadthelabel
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-15 09:12:12	@david_navigator Yeah, I was wondering whether a thorough washing would be sufficient. I usually buy canned!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-15 09:27:44	@david_navigator Excellent - I shall try them out. :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-15 09:29:59	@carriesquair Will do :) Will be soaking them as well (as apparently helps with digestion?)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-15 10:40:59	@carriesquair It's to reduce phytates (phytic acid) which can be aggravating to the gut.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-15 10:45:25	@kenscheer Sorry to hear that, hope you feel better!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-15 17:03:28	@kenscheer Hopefully the worst is over!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-13 19:04:19	@emmacarderrd I'm just lurking, a #glutenfree blogger :-) #rduk
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-12 15:53:14	@gfcakelover @Jane_Barringer I'm on my first week - been better than expected. Eating roast butternut squash, soups etc
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-12 16:38:21	@jane_barringer According to this site, 1lb a week is the average (1500 participants) http://t.co/5sFtr8a1yC
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-12 16:47:38	@jane_barringer I have been pigging out a little but not too badly. The intention was more as a way of controlling hunger/blood sugar dips
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 10:40:26	A bit late to the game, but here is my #coeliac diagnosis story for #gutfeeling week @Coeliac_UK http://t.co/5uPAcNfE1q
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 11:15:26	@kgollop I know. It's really affected my ability to trust doctors. :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 11:26:45	@carriesquair Absolutely. So many still believe myth of "only happens to children" or "you have to be really skinny"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 11:29:29	@gfreeb Mine was at Kingston hospital. Perhaps I should have complained about all the doctors...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 11:33:55	@david_navigator @gfreeb @CarrieSquair @Coeliac_UK Yeah, not much distinction between public/private I think since they cross over so much
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 11:34:43	@gfreeb Yeah, I feel like telling them "Look, I know how to search pubmed and read a medical journal, I'm not an idiot!" ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 11:36:41	@gfreeb I have found recently qualified doctors to be far better than established doctors. All too easy to get behind on those journals...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 12:25:14	@glutenpedia Glad you liked it! I'm just reading your website now as I may be moving to NL soon!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 12:27:12	@flobristow Writing my story was definitely a cathartic experience! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 13:39:03	@coeliacme Cheers :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 14:58:55	@glutenpedia Probably Haarlem. Yes I will learn some dutch - I know german so it should be fairly straightforward to learn :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 15:17:56	@glutenpedia well if/when I get to Haarlem, we must meet up for a glutenvrij lunch! :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-14 09:20:20	RT @honeybunsbakery: And we also have two Honeybuns gluten free Baking book &amp; gift bag sets to be won - enter our competition...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-14 09:44:21	New post! Chocolatey breakfast quinoa: #glutenfree #dairyfree #vegan http://t.co/gPZDdmethh
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-14 11:37:15	@Dovesfarm Is there a way of finding a local stockist for your quinoa cookies? Local doves farm stockists dont do them :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-14 13:06:39	Does anyone have a #glutenfree cookbook they would like me to review which I haven't already?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-14 13:31:20	@david_navigator Haha either!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-14 13:31:42	@david_navigator But I'm not sure why you'd want me to review a book you already have... :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 11:39:39	@gfreeb Wow, thats pretty shitty! I wonder if there's a tendency to ignore complaints from young females in general?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-14 14:19:49	Just tried "Yes You Can" bread - actually really good and very different to other #glutenfree breads on the market! Worth a try!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-14 14:20:34	@coeliacireland Thanks! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-14 14:31:58	@gfreeb Soft and chewy - not exactly like normal bread but a good alternative if that makes sense? Better flavour, too.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 08:42:11	@wbites @lovelactosefree @likeazebora @gfreeb @kgollop @coeliacme @noomie82 @CookieQueen1987 @McGowanKim Thanks have a good w/e! :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 11:19:20	@david_navigator @ByronBayCookie @AllergyShow Never seen them on sale before!!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 13:55:04	@glutendude This trope pops up quite frequently here, its always the neurotic/annoying one who is #glutenfree... v disappointed in disney
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 16:04:56	Experimental mango curd - successful. Going to have to find a good #gf pastry recipe before I blog it though... know any failsafe recipes?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 16:40:11	@chrisnhook6 Thanks Chris :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 17:34:06	@miko100 Different in what way?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 17:49:56	@miko100 That's odd, I have only been glutened once, but I pick my restaurants very carefully! I found US to be more risky re: X-contam
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 15:03:29	@glutenpedia I can actually read a lot of dutch already from the german I know. Pronouncing and understanding might be a bit harder! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 15:04:01	@glutenpedia Haha, its ok. I just hope that the Dutch will be friendly and patient with me!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 15:08:03	@glutenpedia Well I think I'll be happy if I can learn to talk a little and read. I don't know how long we'll be there yet. Where r u based?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-14 20:06:23	@samipears I shop there as little as poss but necessary for certain items!! So I usually check the freefrom aisle.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-16 19:39:58	@mrsemcope Thanks :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-13 12:34:41	@david_navigator Not yet - I might try and review them soon. Love figs too!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-13 13:15:07	@londonlobster Are your chips fried in a dedicated fryer?

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-18 12:19:24	@jaghanian @PizzaExpress hope you enjoy! Such a relief not to worry about X-contamination
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-14 20:41:12	Thanks @PizzaExpress for a great #glutenfree meal at your Worcester Park branch.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-14 20:56:55	@samipears Sure - I've followed you now :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-15 07:10:49	@wbites Sounds excellent! I'm going to try and write a lot but it's hard to motivate myself!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 10:38:33	Review: #glutenfree airline food on @VirginAtlantic http://t.co/ep6sfwrjBv
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 10:54:02	My friend works at a concert venue and wants to know what #glutenfree snacks are tasty so she can update the menu. What do you suggest?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 11:00:45	@stace8383 Just googled them - they sound amazing but you can't get them in the UK :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 11:02:35	@stace8383 I've often come across nachos that aren't #gf... sad times. I'm always like "What do you PUT in them?!"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 11:05:34	@stace8383 No it's not - but some restaurants don't seem to realise that! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 11:05:54	@stace8383 Care packages welcome... I wouldn't want to feel deprived! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 11:09:27	@david_navigator Oh wow! They look amazing. And a nice big GLUTEN FREE on the packaging.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 11:13:48	@stace8383 Hahaha! Do you get Isabel's pizza mix over there?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 11:18:59	@stace8383 It's the best! I'm sure @IsabelsCuisine would ship to AUS http://t.co/6pNiNPDFjW

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 16:38:23	@barmycakes I think if you can puree it, you can make a curd out of it :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 17:03:46	@miko100 If it makes us that ill it's clear we shouldn't be eating so I'm not sure what an official diagnosis would add!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 17:06:36	@miko100 It's hard to trust again when doctors have failed you for so long!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 17:21:13	@janice_gillies That's good to hear. How long was your diagnosis process?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-17 17:44:18	@janice_gillies Great that you got it all sorted out! :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-20 09:56:34	@david_navigator @wbites @BribedwithFood I'm now involved with an app called @CanIEatIt - all allergy info on there! http://t.co/uNpxbZ92Jf
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-20 10:03:11	@bribedwithfood It shows a lot more than the screenshots show - unfortunately I have no apple products so can't test it out right now!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-20 10:37:52	Starting week 3 of 5:2 diet. Huge bowl of spicy butternut squash for lunch! Getting used to it, and feeling much better in myself.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-20 10:43:06	@bellasbakeryuk It sounds a lot harder than it actually is! Just need to retrain our brains not to expect 3 meals a day!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-20 10:50:18	@bellasbakeryuk You just need to find low cal, high volume, high fibre foods. Enough for 2 satisfying meals a day I think.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-20 10:58:28	@bellasbakeryuk I had a great prawn curry with loads of veg as well, which was a great dinner.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-20 11:36:13	@kgollop @gfreeb @david_navigator @noomie82 Think they were just all ppl who work at Innocent smoothies...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-20 11:41:18	@kgollop @gfreeb @noomie82 Has a slight whiff of "Oh isn't this such a lark?!" about it too. :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-20 11:58:22	In case you missed it with all the #gutfeeling week excitement last week: my #coeliac diagnosis story http://t.co/5SA6Qf1bha
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-20 13:23:06	I am scouring the web for #glutenfree producers to review for the @CanIEatIt app (plus my website). Any suggestions?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-20 13:47:32	@noomie82 @coeliacme @wbites @david_navigator OMG yum!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-20 13:57:26	@david_navigator @wbites @noomie82 @coeliacme Sun? What's that? #paleascasper

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-20 16:55:26	Great blog post from @gfreeb on "My New Normal" - life after #coeliac diagnosis http://t.co/4Bqnwjr2Cx
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-21 07:31:50	Woke up to 1000 followers! :) Thanks all! I do feel a bit more pressure to stop prattling on so much though...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-21 07:49:00	Making #glutenfree rice pancakes with cooked rice. A bit like a ricey omelette...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-21 08:02:56	@itsgottobegf Yeah, I think next time I'll mash the rice a bit first! Are dosas made with rice flour?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-21 09:06:32	@jane_barringer @gfcakelover @itsgottobegf I bet they are great with kaya (coconut jam). mmm
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-22 16:01:32	If any #glutenfree peeps need a room for the allergy show, I'm on airbnb - fully gluten-free kitchen! http://t.co/Q1wIoGPx2F
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-28 08:09:13	Back from a bit of a break from Twitter... what did I miss?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-28 09:08:54	@glutenfreeuae Ha! So how's life living #glutenfree in UAE?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-28 12:00:27	@gfreeb @kgollop @noomie82 @anniesupperclub @Perkierfoods @DavidJ_GF I feel left out - have I been removed from your email list? :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-28 12:23:14	@kgollop @gfreeb @noomie82 @anniesupperclub @Perkierfoods @DavidJ_GF Yep, will be there &amp; helping out Isabel's on one day hopefully!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-28 15:03:57	@isabelscuisine @stace8383 Ah, I didn't know you were on Amazon! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-28 15:16:17	Can anyone recommend any good UK based bloggers who are #dairyfree but not #glutenfree?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-28 16:11:50	A great article about women and the treatment of pain by doctors. http://t.co/uLDIzNG5VB
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-28 18:30:31	@gf_froggie Yeah, that's my problem! There must be some #dairyfree bloggers out there!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 09:41:29	@foodallergyuk @gf_froggie @sarahjchapman @Piginthekitchen @nodairyoreggs @AboutDairyFree Thanks for all your suggestions :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 09:43:52	@sugarpuffish Cool, your blog looks great! Esp about FreeFrom not catering adequately to food allergies other than #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 10:26:51	New post! 7 #glutenfree foods to look for in an Asian supermarket http://t.co/RvOW4SiKoH
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 12:21:47	Just received some samples to review but they all contain #glutenfree oats which I can't eat! Waaah! #screwyouavenin
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 13:27:19	@michcarey400 They're Frank bars (not sure if in the shops yet). A small proportion of coeliacs can't eat pure oats - I get gluten symptoms!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 14:26:10	@beccafetts Ah! Can't believe I forgot them - there's a pack in my cupboard as well. Love dipping them in soy sauce with prawn + veg filling
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 14:26:45	@gfreeb @beccafetts Yes, although you do need to be careful about cross-contam with certain brands. I've never had a problem though.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 16:31:58	@coeliacme I had been looking forward to eating them! Not sure I can trust my bfs opinion! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 16:33:02	@GlutenFreeZest maybe we could have a flapjack party and not eat anything with a whole bunch of us :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 16:34:36	@___Charlotte__ the biscuits are the worst when they sneakily use oat flour! :-(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 08:33:04	@will_young_ @GFGuerrillas @AllergyShow See you there! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 08:34:05	@coeliacme @NCV_glutenvrij #glutenfree food in dutch supermarkets (even small ones) tends to be very good!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 08:34:49	@noomie82 @AllergyShow Whoo hoo! I'll be there :D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 08:37:31	7 #glutenfree foods to look for in an Asian supermarket *now updated with some reader suggestions!* http://t.co/Tbo2nKowY3
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 12:17:04	@ilumiworld @GFreeRadio @VeniceBakeryUK @kitchenkarma @MiriLewis Ah thanks! Have a great weekend! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 21:34:14	@GFGuerrillas @ilumiworld agreed - such a lovely evening! Glad I 'helped' you with the tube (?!) :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 21:35:41	@itsgottobegf @DigitalBlonde @GFGuerrillas @ilumiworld  Hear hear! Great night and good to put names to faces :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 15:51:01	Having a fast day on a Friday is the worst idea ever #5:2diet
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 15:58:36	@gfreeb Can't anyone come up with NEW flavours?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 16:02:33	@gfreeb What about hazelnut &amp; choc chip? Orange &amp; walnut? Strawberry &amp; cream? But no, what we need are two brands of each flavour.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 16:03:49	@gfreeb The only thing remaining that they do which no one else does I think are the croissants &amp; pain au chocolat? Time to step up the game
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 16:04:37	@gfreeb Mmmmmmmmm.... (fast day fooddreaming!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 16:05:28	@coeliacme @gfreeb Huh! I'm sure I saw them not long ago...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 16:06:21	@gfreeb Pretty well actually! It's only really difficult between 3-6pm. Lost 3kg so far. Feeling a lot better &amp; dark circles have improved!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 16:06:49	@gfreeb I've not tried the pancakes! Seems a bit pointless when I could just make my own.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 21:41:34	@GFGuerrillas great to meet another wine-oriented #coeliac! We should have a ranty meetup soon :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 21:46:15	@GFGuerrillas if the weather cheers up I'm totally up for hosting a #gf bbq at mine...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 21:47:45	@GFGuerrillas @ilumiworld I get my superpowers from wine. Only ever been lost once in london, and that was champagne's fault :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 21:52:45	@flobristow that could work! I'll get in touch tomo! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 21:54:06	@GFGuerrillas I have a gazebo to keep the rain off and we can all wear ski jackets ... #britishsummer
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 22:16:19	@foodiequine Cool, did you need any suggestions in particular? #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 22:17:56	@itsgottobegf @ilumiworld @MelKirk  Not samples from ilumi! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 22:30:06	@foodiequine You CAN, but it will make a batter more than a dough. Still bakes well but handles a little differently.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-30 22:31:10	@itsgottobegf London #glutenfree bloggers meetup/rant?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 16:09:26	My second post for @canieatit: Gluten-free Sam has tasted Sconeybuns http://t.co/9FEy0nTDD2
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 16:11:05	@gfreeb I definitely eat "heartily" ;) You need to overeat by 600 calories a day to not lose weight, and I definitely dont binge THAT much!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 16:11:57	@gfreeb I may make some of these flavours at the weekend with some @amyruthbaking mix... nomnom
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-05-31 16:12:39	@gfreeb Oh sure, but I think overall the maths is on my side. Sugar cravings are way down though.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-03 21:15:44	@jfishy72 That's really sad :( I wish that people would just make the effort to understand sometimes.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-05 16:31:28	@melkirk Which tweet??
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-05 16:38:53	@melkirk Oh man, I think I'm going blind. Will have another look ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 09:00:57	Read about the launch of a new line of #glutenfree #dairyfree meals from @ilumiworld http://t.co/bDqxUyiIGy
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 09:17:39	As an @AllergyShow virgin, I'm getting really quite excited about it! Looking forward to meeting lots of new #glutenfree people :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 09:20:59	@nels3 @AllergyShow It's probably going to be a good idea to make a badge with my twitter handle on it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 09:21:13	@noomie82 Uh oh!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 09:48:07	@CeriKitchen @AllergyShow  good plan!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 09:48:57	@barmycakes @noomie82 ok now I'm scared!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 09:50:30	@Jane_Barringer @GlutenFreeandGs that's what I thought when I read that.  I think you just have to be more aware, even as a child
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-07 18:46:18	@dietitianuk Come and say hi! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-07 18:49:44	@gfreeb How many of you are meeting initially tomorrow? Do you know?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 10:14:06	@barmycakes @noomie82 Haha never! I don't think I could - way too paranoid :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 10:42:59	@gfreeb @barmycakes @noomie82 I know! I think I'll go for the "so tell me about your product" approach... ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 11:23:26	My bf, with his face full of @HoneybunsBakery #glutenfree flapjack: "fwthis ciss armazin!! mmmmmm! mmmmm! mmmmm!"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 11:27:54	@gfreeb I'm working on it! ;) I need someone to sample oaty products!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 11:28:48	@gfreeb Hahaha! Brilliant! I love how they are all laid out on a big plate as if to emphasise the sparse landscape of the broccoli
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 11:30:11	@gfreeb What about this salad? http://t.co/59bayYf4X6
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 12:24:28	@gfreeb WTFFFF??? Why bother with pasta at all?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 12:25:16	@gfreeb To be fair, there's quite a few calories in 1/2 cup olive oil... #whyamIdefendingthis
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-07 18:52:43	@gfreeb It was mental today - and that was the quiet day. I'm a bit scared about tomorrow... good job you guys are coming early.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-07 20:09:42	@perkierfoods Ahh! Are you the ones poking us through the curtain?? :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-03 08:04:11	Being a #coeliac is a bit like being a spy; you never know who's put poison in your food.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-03 08:09:08	@gfreeb Oh no! What with?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-03 08:31:14	@sweetcheeksltd @gfreeb That sucks - happens to the best of us... only takes the tiniest of oversights. Hope you feel better soon! xxx
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-03 08:39:28	@whishydreamer It's surprising how many different and exciting ways "poison" can get in your food...!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-08 07:02:47	There are two cakes in the oven to bring to @IsabelsCuisine stand 169 at the @AllergyShow today... come for samples! #glutenfree #dairyfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 19:41:04	@shel_bakes I used a vintage pattern off ebay but I'm going to draft my own pattern for the collar. Once you get the hang of it its easy!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 19:42:23	@shel_bakes Here's the pattern I used. Maybe not suitable for beginners but ok when you've done a few dresses! http://t.co/fnkJKGlGrp
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 17:45:13	I'm super excited about my homemade knockoff Temperley dress and it's not even done yet! http://t.co/iav0E7eHb5
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-03 10:55:04	Don't know what to do with quinoa? Here's an easy &amp; delicious #glutenfree midweek meal http://t.co/gHdyMnkoru
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-04 19:44:36	@shel_bakes Here is the pattern for the first dress I ever made (using old curtains) - great practice and free :) http://t.co/0O53vad7Gx
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-03 17:26:09	@jfishy72 I don't understand that... if you had a nut allergy they'd get it, wouldn't they?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-06 08:02:03	The @AllergyShow takes place this weekend! Come say hi to me at @IsabelsCuisine stand! http://t.co/IhuykPlfyk

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-06 09:44:18	@noomie82 I JUST PUT MY HAND IN THERE TO GET A NEW TIN!!! Trauma
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-06 09:48:17	@noomie82 Compensation for my trauma to be paid directly to me in chocolate...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-06 10:08:51	@waitrose Have done.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-06 11:15:53	@glutenfree_chic Is Bruschetta too obvious? ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-06 11:20:59	@glutenfree_chic Wait... WE literally live around the corner! It's the only place locally we go out...been meaning to try the Cocoanut tho

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-06 19:44:32	@david_navigator Will be on Isabel's stand in the morning, then wandering for the rest of the days.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-06 19:49:05	@david_navigator Will do! Enjoy the show :D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 15:26:21	Managed to successfully heat @ilumiworld microwave basmati rice without a microwave - ricecooker + small amount of water = win.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 15:27:31	Some pictures from the @AllergyShow with @IsabelsCuisine : https://t.co/2qg8s7tO2M
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-09 17:40:35	Right. I'm officially taking the day off tomorrow. The @AllergyShow has worn me out!!! Great to meet so many of you!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-09 19:23:22	@coeliacme @___Charlotte__ Mine is #glutenfree baking at xmas - but loads suitable for not-xmas too! http://t.co/CY3PfQEbqc
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-09 19:45:25	I now completely understand why they dont let flat footed people join the army. Absolute agony. Had bubble bath, now to get some sympathy :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-07 18:23:03	@venicebakeryuk Your #vegan pizzas were awesome! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-07 18:28:45	Great 1st day at @AllergyShow. Will b there tomo on stand 169... come freak me out by saying "I know you from Twitter!!!" ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-07 18:34:08	@gfreeb I may or may not be off to the shops to make some @IsabelsCuisine based coconut &amp; banana cakes for samples...

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-07 20:10:13	@glutenfreewife1 Cool, enjoy your Allergy Show experience :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-07 20:13:23	@sweetcheeksltd Wow... impressive!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-07 20:48:03	@tracyattridge See ya tomorrow!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 07:46:32	@Perkierfoods LOVED the oat-free porridge! Taste of buckwheat not too overpowering. Yum yum. Thanks for the sample! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 08:53:50	I'm supposed to be taking the day off but I'm not sitting here, twiddling my thumbs. Guess I'll do some writing then!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 09:13:51	@kgollop @noomie82 @itsgottobegf Yeah, agreed. Different sort of people on FB to Twitter also.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 09:27:58	I review Angelic #glutenfree cookies for @CanIEatIt http://t.co/Rnbpm0K4hU

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 13:53:51	@shelleyf1066 You too! Glad it was a successful weekend for you. My legs are gonna take a day or two to recover!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 14:17:22	Dear everyone, can we please stop calling it "friendly bacteria", PLEASE? We're not five years old any more.

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 18:11:22	@nels3 Doctors are the worst sometimes :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 18:17:30	@nels3 Ah, it's tricky if you need a referral! My doctors ended up putting me down as "suspected" coeliac (even though I blatantly am)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-12 14:41:53	Making some @perkierfoods #glutenfree #oatfree flapjacks! woop!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-12 14:58:07	@jfishy72 @Perkierfoods Will do!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-12 15:10:05	@perkierfoods @jfishy72 Following your recipe but added some goji berries and figs! And substituted a bit of porridge for sorghum flour
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-12 15:34:03	@carriesquair @Perkierfoods @jfishy72 Here are the flapjacks! #glutenfree #oatfree http://t.co/9bYzCaPvGD
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-12 15:37:23	@carriesquair @Perkierfoods @jfishy72 Mine are being demolished at an astounding rate. They aren't even cool yet.

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-12 18:40:04	@nels3 I hate it when they do that!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-12 18:42:14	@nels3 Me neither! #justifiablyparanoid
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 20:21:14	@gfreeb Although there's a link between asthma &amp; skin/food allergies, so maybe people are only willing to travel for one show a year?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 20:21:45	@itsgottobegf @gfreeb So many people were grabbing samples without checking first, despite clear signs saying "no chat, no sample".
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 20:22:55	@gfreeradio @gfreeb Yeah, a more formal approach to labelling would be good. Can't believe the risks I saw being taken. Esp kids!!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 20:23:42	@cupcakecorneruk @GFreeRadio @gfreeb Would you not prefer 2 less crowded events each year though?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 20:30:04	@cupcakecorneruk @GFreeRadio @gfreeb Ha! A desperate coeliac show would be interesting to visit! ;) I assume you meant separate?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 20:31:51	@itsgottobegf @gfreeb A lot of people acting like savages, stuffing food into their mouths . Lots of non-allergy ppl came 4 free food 2 :-/
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 20:33:11	@cupcakecorneruk @GFreeRadio @gfreeb Tee hee! To be fair, there are lots of desperate coeliacs!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 20:47:04	@itsgottobegf @gfreeb Oh, I'm not blaming people who want to try foods, but people who grab a sample and then *literally* run away. Srsly!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-10 20:51:30	@itsgottobegf @gfreeb Loads of non-coeliacs there for free food, very sad. No wonder so crowded!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-15 09:23:33	@gfreeradio Thanks for the mention! I'd be happy to contribute properly to a show in the future :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-11 06:22:51	@GFGuerrillas @AllergyShow agreed! I came across many people who told me they didn't have allergies!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-11 07:50:24	@davidj_gf @GFreeRadio @GFGuerrillas @AllergyShow They TOLD me!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-11 07:51:37	@davidj_gf @GFreeRadio @gfreeb @GFGuerrillas Not having a go even at the faddies just people who come for free food w/ no intention 2 buy!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-11 10:17:01	@glutenfree_chic Ooh, now I have to try it! Let me know if you're up for a mini #gf meetup ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-11 10:18:39	Great photo of the choas! RT @allergyshow: WOW!!! http://t.co/PhOhdeUnFO
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-11 11:40:14	Sorry for being a grump about the @AllergyShow : just met too many rude people &amp; get very claustrophobic with lots of people around!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-11 13:17:50	@glutenfreeandgs Some people actually asked me a question and turned away as I was answering... happened more than once.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-13 08:27:14	Product review: #glutenfree Moroccan vegetable tagine by @ilumiworld http://t.co/lc1cmezozT
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-13 08:33:25	@itsgottobegf Even their savoury meat pies are sweet!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-13 09:28:34	@itsgottobegf V strange as not all other north african cuisine is sweet, is it?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-13 09:45:12	@itsgottobegf Haha! I do like sweet things but I've never liked savoury food that's too sweet. Not a fan of fruit in meals.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-14 09:48:06	@isabelscuisine Aww, thanks! Have a great one yourself! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-11 18:22:55	@happygoluckycat Ah, that's a shame! Yes, had to take a few breaks - feet were killing me!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-14 15:48:49	Friday afternoon and I'm home alone, in my parents' house, with two sleeping cats and slow internet access. What to do?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-14 16:02:32	@itsgottobegf I'm still trying to get them to be friends! My mum's cat is NOT impressed with the company http://t.co/tuNTPh1sIX
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-14 16:12:12	@itsgottobegf Haha! She's just really cheeky and playful - taking over territories that aren't hers!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-14 16:18:22	@jfishy72 I like the concept but find they drag it out too long - am I the only one who doesn't care about contestants on these shows?! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-14 16:19:54	@itsgottobegf Nah, she's totally enjoying her box! Cardboard is like cashmere to cats, apparently. Storm (my cat) wants to b friends tho :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-14 16:20:57	@jfishy72 They are fun, but I never know the celebrities! #needtogetwiththetimes
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-14 16:21:59	@itsgottobegf Her manners are questionable when she hisses everytime Storm tries to be friendly. She's ex-rescue though, so a bit grumpy!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-14 16:34:34	@itsgottobegf The b/w one is called Ninja (I named her!) :P Bc when we got her, she scuttled around like a ninja &amp; is amazing at hiding
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-18 08:52:33	@glutenfreerosie @coeliacme @GFBitesUK Great stuff! Wishing you luck with it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-18 14:37:31	@allergyshow Mine should be up tomorrow!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-18 15:05:19	@beccafetts I have had quite a few! Must be the allure of free food! I'm favouriting all the offers - but how do I decide?!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-18 15:16:39	@tracyattridge There's still time - I haven't made any decisions yet. :) Might need to blog to explain more about it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-18 15:37:34	@wbites @tracyattridge Ah! Too much! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-20 08:57:02	@canieatit But companies will get around it by saying "1/8 of a pizza contains" in small print...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-20 10:33:37	A #glutenfree chocolate peanut butter pie made with GFree Sweet Ready to Roll pastry? YES PLEASE! Thx @DeliDivine http://t.co/ciwfCr42nN

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-18 11:55:34	Hey Tweeps! I'm looking for someone who CAN eat #glutenfree #oats to help me review products for my blog. UK based - any volunteers?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-18 11:58:45	@chylledapps Thanks!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-21 11:37:21	@gfguerrillas @Coeliac_UK Doctors on the whole CBA with investigating oats - I get similar symptoms to #gluten, its a serious issue
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-21 12:47:03	@wbites No problemo. Not much planned for the weekend - might have some exciting news soon though.. :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-21 15:25:59	Anyone been to the #glutenfree chateau in France?? http://t.co/VWmpiPT8gL
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-21 15:38:34	@gffoodie Nice! More quinoa, less shell methinks :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-21 15:46:39	@cupcakecorneruk Nah, just curious! I prefer self-catered holidays anyway - half the fun is going to the local markets and stuff!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-24 15:52:48	@sophiessteaks are you able to cater for #glutenfree diets (i.e. #coeliacs) who want some carbs with their steak?

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-25 08:32:48	@sophiessteaks Thanks! :) Are they fried in the same oil as anything gluten-containing?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-25 08:58:41	@sophiessteaks Will do! Thanks so much for your reply, will be sure to write up a review. :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-25 12:38:40	@coeliacme @veronicassnacks They are very delicious, sort of like a posh Pom Bear but less greasy!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-25 14:20:45	@gfandfabulous @veronicassnacks Yeah, they look ace!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-25 16:59:05	I have declared the US version of The Killing to be naff compared to the Danish version. Not the same without Sarah Lund!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-25 16:03:23	@glutenpedia Followed you now but yes e-mail is best: sam@thehappycoeliac.com
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-25 19:37:44	@jfishy72 maybe it's just because the danish version was SO intense,  nothing could ever live up to it.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-26 08:33:41	@jfishy72 I think I may have to agree with you there!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-28 10:08:36	@isabelscuisine That looks so good! I might do that today... :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-28 10:19:53	I have a spare ticket to see Book of Mormon tonight in London - our group had a last minute drop out. Anyone want to go?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-28 10:38:26	@isabelscuisine Not sure what flavour to make though - I don't have poppy seeds. Any ideas?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-28 11:14:12	@isabelscuisine Tee hee hee! These are SO FUN! (I decided to keep it simple for the first time &amp; made herbed ones)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-06-28 12:53:45	@isabelscuisine Ah ok! They were very delicious anyway though :) Will try and do a video for take 2.

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-03 22:10:00	Is butter a carb? #nomnom #meangirls
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-06 10:21:58	Is anyone NOT having a barbecue today?!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-06 10:25:02	@coeliacme Whoo! You're welcome to come to ours today though ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-06 10:56:46	@coeliacme @Perkierfoods bit of cider in the office never did anyone any harm ;-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-05 17:02:27	@wbites @BristolEating @kgollop @coeliacme @tracyattridge @gfreeb @gfcakelover @DavidJ_GF Have a great sunny weekend y'all! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-05 19:50:24	I'm featured on this week's episode of @GFreeRadio talking about #glutenfree travel! http://t.co/N0Zp1Ms9Rz
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-01 07:49:53	@sophiessteaks Disappointed to be told on Saturday that I couldn't have the chips as they weren't #gf - could you clarify?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-01 09:27:58	Would any #gf person (who can also eat oats) be willing to do a guest post for me in the next week or so? E-mail: sam@thehappycoeliac.com
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-01 09:30:43	@gfreeb That would be excellent! Will e-mail you...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-01 10:04:15	Planning a trip to #newyork and don't know where to eat #glutenfree &amp; #coeliac friendly? Have a look at my summery: http://t.co/bVydaCZcHL

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-06 21:30:58	@beccafetts I just take over the whole thing, make it entirely #gf ;-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-01 16:52:43	@jane_barringer Most of my memories of my mormor involved baking of some kind... :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-01 16:56:50	@jane_barringer Yes! My mum is Danish so all the xmas stuff we do is danish, inc celebrating on dec 24th ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-01 17:05:24	@jane_barringer Yeah, it's wonderful isn't it? Great food &amp; tradition. Although I never much cared for ris a l'amande...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-01 17:13:43	@jane_barringer We have to make it with lactofree milk otherwise it gives me and my mum bad tummy ache!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-07 13:22:12	Cider and @isabelscuisine dough balls in the sun... Perfection! http://t.co/9qAyrzBBxY

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-08 06:21:30	@gfreeb hope it wasnt the oats! :-(  Maybe plain old sickness?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-08 06:26:16	@gfreeb and you have a #glutenfree  kitchen dont you?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-08 06:37:50	@gfreeb Must be so frustrating! :( Take care of yourself xxx

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-08 18:24:20	@rachelsarah_23 Ya, I know!!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-09 19:27:30	@gfreeb @Perkierfoods @gf_traveller If you want something impossible to kill, plant some chives ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-09 19:38:02	@gfreeb Seriously. It won't die. It's taken over the herb patch and survived 2 harsh winters.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-09 07:06:21	@gfguerrillas Too much sugar? I can't eat a lot of gf processed food for that reason.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-09 07:54:57	@davidj_gf @GFGuerrillas I often wonder whether it's the gums they use to bind it as I know some people are sensitive to them.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-10 08:04:17	@familylifefife Many congratulations! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-10 08:29:22	@roger_uk Yeah, that's the one. I made it with mozzarella and parmesan (the only cheese I had in the house!!)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-12 14:45:14	Well, I'm totally bummed out after watching a Waco documentary... :/
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-12 11:32:48	@sugarpuffish @gfreeb There will b rioting &amp; food handed thru the school gates. Its the parents responsibility 2 ensure adequate nutrition
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-12 11:40:52	@gfreeb @sugarpuffish Mine involve starving and having a breadroll w/ salt on it &amp; having packed lunch at pickup.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-12 11:44:10	@cottagebakery @gfreeb Obviously, the freaks will be singled out by enforced packed lunches for allergic children. Maybe a sign &amp; a hat too.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-12 11:54:39	@gfreeb They apparently also went to just 50 schools to write the report.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-12 12:01:12	@gfreeb @david_navigator Or ministers who are experts in their fields not career politicians?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-12 12:15:59	@cottagebakery @gfreeb Probably want them in a sealed room.

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-15 09:12:54	Yet another beautiful day! I think I'm almost about to forgive the weather for the rest of the year! #vitaminD
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-15 10:16:33	@elephantcamel Well, maybe I'll forgive it for the year so far provided the rest of 2013 isn't TOO bad :-P

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-15 13:28:40	@kgollop The sunshine is great, isnt it? Yep, enjoying last few weeks in UK before Amsterdam awaits... v exciting but will miss #gf peeps
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-15 13:41:18	@kgollop Not sure yet, we are calling it "indefinite" at the moment... depends on how much we like it basically!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-15 14:04:30	@cookiequeen1987 @kgollop Agreed. My only complaint is that everywhere is out of paddling pools! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-17 06:08:33	Apparently today will be the hottest day so far, luckily I've ordered a paddling pool!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-17 06:08:59	@gfreeb August 5th will be my moving day too :) Congratulations - the super stressful part is over!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-17 06:14:22	@gfreeb Its a surprisingly grown up feeling! Hope Cyprus is great - at least the good weather here should continue for a while!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-17 15:36:18	@nogiiuk @CanIEatIt I managed to get hold of a paddling pool today. Now I just need a waterproof laptop and I'm set for summer time working

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-23 11:31:43	@ScoopGelato Do you still do #glutenfree cones?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-23 11:37:36	Things that make no sense #52: restaurants &amp; cafes offering #glutenfree items and not advertising them on their website, menu or signs.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-23 11:52:00	@missgingeruk Or those who just have a general disclaimer about all allergens because they don't want allergic customers.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-23 12:19:13	@david_navigator Maybe they are afraid of stampeding hordes of coeliacs...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-25 12:46:16	@gfreeb @AbelandCole Slimy yet satisfying? :D

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-25 18:06:11	@wbites @gfreeb WHAT! Yes, on toast first!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-25 18:30:02	@david_navigator @gfreeb @wbites I wonder whether my love of nutella is innate now after a childhood of eating nothing but nutella
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-25 18:31:05	@healthjourno Good article - I started ranting again in your comments but managed to keep it short this time :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-25 18:32:00	@david_navigator @gfreeb @wbites Yeah, it REALLY doesn't taste much of nuts. Those adverts lie.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-25 18:43:12	@wbites Once uve tried nutella on toast u can level up to nutella + peanut butter. Only then may you try the holy trinity w/ banana as well
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-07-26 11:03:27	@honeybunsbakery I probably should have tested it plain to see what it was like but I couldn't resist melting chocolate into it! :D

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-11 09:30:29	Yummy #glutenfree pizza at @tweetwoodstone in #haarlem - http://t.co/K4tkloLRFr review to follow soon! #glutenvrij
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-09 21:18:53	First proper night out in #haarlem. Yummy #glutenfree pizza and chilled out continental drinking. Ah bliss!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-12 09:25:21	1st post in a while, here's my review of @tweetwoodstone Woodstone Pizza in Haarlem: http://t.co/y7KDilZiLP #glutenfree #glutenvrij
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 07:42:49	@NiamhFoskin it was really good! A little too good actually ;-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 14:01:46	In Denmark, you can get slices of chocolate for your bread, but in Holland you can buy a range of chocolate sprinkles for your bread! #win
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-13 18:42:59	Trying out Betty Crocker's #glutenfree brownie mix tonight. Just what I need to cure this headache - CHOCOLATE!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 15:09:29	@mrswrafter Haven't quite got round to putting them on bread, but they are great on my yoghurt! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 16:29:19	@wbites But I don't understand - do americans actually measure butter out in cups?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 16:30:43	@ljbarton But how do you get the butter into the cups? Or do Americans just know that 1 cup butter = 8oz?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 16:32:34	@gf_traveller @wbites So I assume all butter is the same density then?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 16:36:09	@gf_traveller @wbites Grams among younger generation, ounces among grandparents' generation
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 16:37:25	@gf_traveller @wbites Now I am googling "density of butter" I should really find a better way to spend my evening... ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 16:39:59	@gf_traveller @wbites I am disturbed by the "start measure here" line... do people chop off the ends of their butter? Oh the humanity!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 16:48:16	@anaturalstate But how do you smush it down without making a giant mess?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 14:07:35	@gfreeb I not only have found stroopwafels but also regular waffles covered in chocolate! They seem a bit dodgy though- kind of crumbly/dry.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 14:10:40	@gfreeb Just looked up the dutch for waffle iron... it's "wafelijzer" (waffleiser!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 15:33:56	@gfreeb Ah right. There are also a lot of old-fashioned diseases involved with swearing in Dutch. "I hope you get syphilis..." etc
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 15:41:39	@gffoodie @wbites @coeliacme @gfreeb Once my cat is over here with me, I'm up for a group #glutenfree #catvideo ... just say the word
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 08:20:48	@elfenbankjehrlm Do you do #glutenfree #glutenvrij pancakes?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 16:27:59	@ljbarton Is it really as simple as that?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 08:42:39	@niamhfoskin Not sure where you can get them from in the UK - try google! (I'm in Holland!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 11:46:19	Even though I'm eating quite similar foods to normal, my stomach is still taking a while to settle in a new country... weird!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 14:06:11	Even better, they call the chocolate sprinkles "hagelslag" *snigger* http://t.co/XhGshRARNq
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 14:10:30	@janice_gillies Really well thanks! #gf range is a bit smaller over here, but have found all I need to survive! Good labelling here as well
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 15:12:26	@diprestwich Maybe it's just the increased dairy intake? I'm pretty sure Dutch water is better than UK water... ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 15:30:45	@diprestwich Do tomatoes tend to aggravate the gut?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 16:23:07	Can someone explain to me how Americans measure a CUP of *butter*? This makes no sense to me, so clearly there's something I'm missing
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 16:33:02	@coeliacme @wbites Yeah - I think by about 20ml or so...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 16:34:35	@gf_traveller And does all butter come as "sticks"?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 18:08:15	@anaturalstate That is just crazy talk right there. :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-14 16:50:03	@gfreeradio @gf_traveller @wbites I assumed she was saying they throw in the extra! ;) (Which defeats point of measuring... but oh well!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-15 15:19:34	@gf_traveller @GFreeRadio @wbites Chips &amp; cheese! That takes me back to uni days... #nowonderIputonweight
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 09:27:01	@gluuglehq @gfreeb Mcdonalds? :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 14:09:47	@gfreeb yep - it's high on my list!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 08:29:40	@coeliacme @wbites @noomie82 @kgollop @gfreeb @Perkierfoods @anniesupperclub @GlutenFreek @beglutenfreeB Thx :) Is it Friday already??!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 08:43:47	@nels3 @SeabrookCrisps @tracyattridge @Jane_Barringer @josie_rox @GorgeouslyGF Thx - have a great weekend!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 09:28:55	@gluuglehq @gfreeb But seriously, shall I add NYC ones?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 13:36:47	Now that I've got my kitchen set up, I am definitely going to make some Youtube vids! Any ideas/requests? #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 14:09:29	@beccafetts The chocolate present cake recipe in my xmas book has been at every birthday of my life. Works as layer cake or not.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 14:44:49	@cookiequeen1987 HappyCoeliacTV (but there's nothing on there yet)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 14:55:57	Right, created youtube channelr for REALZ this time guys. Subscribe so I don't feel sad &amp; lonely: http://t.co/7oFDXjAEOl
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 14:38:22	@gfreeb YES! *writes down ideas*
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 14:38:44	@wbites @gfreeb @coeliacme You'd still get views... ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 14:45:13	@gfreeb What colours?!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-18 18:46:34	Taking a little break from the online world for a week or so - some batteries need recharging and I need to stop watching cat videos!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-18 19:11:22	@gfhazlenut Thanks lovely. I really do need to get away from the screen I think. Great to have so many supportive friends on twitter :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-18 19:11:43	@gfcakelover Wanna bet? :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-18 19:12:14	@gfandfabulous Indeed. They will be the downfall of western civilisation: http://t.co/eBZemfXsHq #cats
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-18 19:29:16	@malsannie Thanks :) I'm sure I'll be back with the cat videos shortly... I'm just spending time with my own now after 3 weeks apart
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 22:26:25	@malsannie @gfreeb Waffle-ironer?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-16 22:27:06	@gfreeb @gffoodie @wbites @coeliacme Yes plus other halves in cat outfits...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-17 06:53:06	@gfcakelover Haha cronuts. I don't think I've ever made normal puff pastry, let alone #gf, but I can give it a whirl! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-17 10:07:13	@malsannie @gfreeb Then my work here is done ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 11:36:06	Howdy-ho, glutenfree-rs, I'm back on Twitter. If anyone even noticed I was gone... *sob*
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 11:44:44	@delidivine I've been back in UK for past week but going out for good on Sunday. It's going really well, feels like home already!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 11:46:59	@delidivine Mixed - not much #gf in supermarkets but great awareness in restaurants etc. #coeliacs tend to buy online.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 11:48:20	@delidivine Definitely!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 12:01:03	@delidivine Do you ship to Holland currently?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 20:01:58	@malsannie Good luck with it! I lasted 3 months but seem to have taken August off. I find if something messes w/ my routine I'm thrown.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 12:11:51	@delidivine Certainly! E-mail me: sam@thehappycoeliac.com
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 12:37:04	@malsannie Aww thank you - I'm doing well, how about you? Still doing 5:2?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 13:16:19	@glutenfreemrsd Good thanks! As of Sunday will be in NL indefinitely. How are you getting on these days? Long time no see!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 13:23:00	@glutenfreemrsd Oops, misread that last tweet. Been in Holland &amp; London, lots going on, so I took a break from the internet for a bit. :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 13:25:40	@glutenfreemrsd Ooh congrats!! I had been wondering if you'd had them yet. Moving to Holland for bf's job &amp; change of scene. #londonsmells
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 13:26:57	@gfreeradio Definitely! Give me a couple of weeks so I can eat out a bit more ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 13:43:35	@gfreeradio Yeah, it's a real hardship, but someone has to do it. ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 14:38:10	@glutenfreemrsd In Haarlem, not far from Amsterdam. Feels like home already. Got a backlog of people wanting to visit ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 19:42:50	Huge success with @Foodamentalists #glutenfree doughnut mix #getinmahbelly http://t.co/anCcmGfICs
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 19:48:21	@malsannie Oh no! What happened? I've been slacking off this past month. Time to get back on the wagon!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-27 20:04:24	@glutenfreemrsd It will certainly be quite the adventure! Not as much as twins though - did you have girls or boys?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-28 07:11:40	@claire_tulloch They were most definitely warm! I overdid them a little but I'm not used to deep frying.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-28 07:22:29	@rowjoelane @Foodamentalists Were there many good restaurants there? My #coeliac mum is going in Jan &amp; wants recommendations!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-28 07:54:57	@coeliacstudent Who called you that, the restaurant?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-30 10:42:05	@IsabelsCuisine Have you ever tried making #glutenfree soft pretzels using your bagel recipe?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-30 11:17:50	New post! I review @Foodamentalists #glutenfree doughnut mix! Nom nom nom... http://t.co/VnRKUDIW6G
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-28 10:36:45	Is there anyone left who doesn't watch #gbbo? Am I supposed to like it because I like baking? :-/
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-28 11:11:30	@bionailsbydebra Haha why do you call him Paul "gluten" Hollywood?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-28 12:19:56	@bionailsbydebra Haha! I'd never have guessed! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-28 12:45:24	@healthjourno Do you happen to know whether the term "wheat free" is controlled in the same way #glutenfree is?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-28 15:26:14	@healthjourno Thanks! Have been suspecting many cafes etc of labelling #wheatfree not #glutenfree to avoid legislation. #cynicalcoeliac
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-28 15:27:13	@coeliacireland Awesome, thanks!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-28 15:34:13	@healthjourno Yeah, I was wondering whether it might be deliberate though, to get around the legislation on #glutenfree ...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-08-28 15:34:32	@healthjourno ... since I've never seen anything "wheat free" that didn't come with a disclaimer.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-02 09:12:33	@claire_tulloch @Foodamentalists Thank you :) Glad you liked it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-04 06:17:48	@kgollop @BeingKimberly My ebook should be out by the end of the month, fingers crossed. #howtogoglutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-09 15:32:21	At the moment I have so much to do that of course I'm playing stupid Facebook games instead of doing anything useful... #denial
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-09 09:10:07	Pls help me out by voting for my #glutenfree blog in the @foodsyoucan Free From People's Choice Awards 2013! http://t.co/7FXB153adG
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-09 09:28:26	@kitchenkarma Thanks so much! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-12 11:57:35	Crumpets or scones? Which to bake?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-12 11:59:14	@plymgreengrocer Well you've convinced me... ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-12 11:59:43	@wbites At the same time? I'd need a bigger kitchen... ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-12 12:00:07	@wbites Unless we could somehow invent the scrumpet...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-13 06:54:07	Back on 5:2 diet after 2 month hiatus... this should be fun... not :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-13 07:46:52	@gf4good I was doing so well - didn't skip a day in 3 months and then I had to stop for a strenuous couple of weeks and I've struggled since
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-13 07:53:33	@gf4good Usually skip brekkie &amp; split calories between lunch/dinner. Generally eat 600-700 though. I'm on the green tea!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-13 07:55:24	@ingevanblond For background: http://t.co/J4da5dVCYF See you tomorrow! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-13 08:15:09	@ingevanblond Simple version is - eat very little for 2 days a week, eat normally for the rest.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-13 08:35:00	@gfreemaui Broadly speaking, this one: http://t.co/J4da5dVCYF

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-13 15:57:42	@dairyfree @HealthJourno Haven't really heard of it but know that they make a few ridiculous claims ("curing" autoimmune disease etc)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-11 12:34:44	@lizasalt You dooo?

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-11 16:12:24	Going to try a thai place in Haarlem this evening - website says they cater for #glutenfree and #dairyfree diets! Fingers crossed!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-14 09:04:45	@coeliacme Very!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-14 14:06:02	@saladandsense It depends what you want it to do!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-15 07:18:40	@coeliacme @kgollop @noomie82 Wordpress is not only very user friendly but also very flexible (if you have hosting especially)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-17 10:42:57	Fell halfway down steep Dutch stairs. I'd like my bruise to be more dramatic to elicit some sympathy but alas, it shall not be.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-17 11:02:02	@createagoodlife That's a good idea. It's not like I can even feign a limp, as I hurt my arm...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-17 14:12:35	@createagoodlife Ah genius!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-18 10:57:31	@itsgottobegf How much turmeric do you need???
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-18 11:53:08	@rebelbakery Nothing broken but rather sore!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-18 12:09:43	@itsgottobegf Yummy! I think I'll stick with the bruising...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-18 07:45:28	Note to self: don't slip down Dutch stairs again http://t.co/7HDl1Sqigq
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-18 08:20:31	@itsgottobegf No, just bruised :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-18 10:45:11	@itsgottobegf Hmm... can I add hot chocolate powder to that?!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-24 09:00:21	Read my review of @HoneybunsBakery #glutenfree cake mix and find out what happened to the last 3/4 of the cake... http://t.co/jeFqj3sDfg
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-24 10:36:29	@kitchenkarma @HoneybunsBakery yeah I kept it bc it's cute - still wondering what I can use it for...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-24 10:38:42	@itsgottobegf @GlutenFreeMrsD @_CaffeNero Hope you complained! (or at least asked for a spoon to eat it...)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-25 08:16:38	@Piginthekitchen To be fair, it did its job - screamed "WHEAT FLOUR" at me. Cake definitely shouldnt have that many ingredients!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-23 08:58:40	Can anyone recommend a company that will post #glutenfree birthday cakes anywhere in the UK?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-23 09:49:39	@anniesupperclub Do you have a link I can share with the person? Can only find your supperclub website
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-26 13:57:59	A post I wrote for @CanIEatIt about #glutenfree labelling: http://t.co/jkNwquOAwH

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-23 13:39:29	@lfhkeswick Thanks!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-26 15:54:56	@Mongozobeers Is it just your premium pilsner that is #glutenfree or are your exotic beers also gf?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-27 10:46:41	@cathieb2012 @HealthJourno @CoeliacsMatter @gfreeb @GlutenFreek @GFBlogger Anything in particular?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-27 11:27:57	@cathieb2012 I wrote a #glutenfree #christmas book :) http://t.co/68uFFtKI3k
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-27 14:03:07	@cwcjr @CanIEatIt @VitaminShoppe Is that a supplement?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-27 14:09:39	@cwcjr @CanIEatIt @VitaminShoppe I suspect they r subject to some allergen labelling laws but I doubt they are classed as "food". Not sure.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-27 14:56:03	@cwcjr Food supplements ARE regulated as foods: http://t.co/zrCWKnVDWx
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-01 10:56:15	Could 1 in 10 people be wheat intolerant? http://t.co/3DhN5FgXi1 Interesting read, esp for the Daily Fail
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-30 06:39:46	@shimmyhipdrop I dont know how I managed until now w/out the presence of quality gouda in my life, but I'm not going back 2 those dark days.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-30 08:40:13	Last day to vote for me in the @foodsyoucan awards (Best Free From Food blogger) http://t.co/BTgIzqGQH1 Would mean so much to me! :) Thanks
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-30 20:30:59	@shimmyhipdrop A lot of #gf people have problems with dairy. in #coeliacs if the gut is damaged it cant produce lactase.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-30 20:49:30	@shimmyhipdrop There isn't really a test for lactose intolerance. It can go away after going gf for a while. Milk allergies dont though
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-30 21:02:03	@shimmyhipdrop Yeah, no need to worry unless you have symptoms. Tbh they could still be coeliac related - can take a year to heal!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-29 08:24:35	@GlutenFreek I can't get your blog to load!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-29 08:46:32	@GlutenFreek Seems to be ok now - must have been a hiccup my end. I totally missed your original email btw - happy to contribute smthg!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-09-29 18:52:26	Since moving here my dairy habit has got out of hand. How do you quit in the land of cheese?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-04 14:13:54	Has anyone here been officially diagnosed with ADD and was it a difficult process?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-10 08:50:42	@sonal_budhdev @HaloGarrity I don't understand why it's popular right now - I didn't think it was suitable for wheat allergic either!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-10 08:55:50	@gfglamourpuds I'm always happy to review for my blog but also for the @CanIEatIt app :-) #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-10 10:33:19	New post! I review @GlebeFarmFood #glutenfree sultana scone, white and brown bread mixes! http://t.co/ypEWcGgXtS

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-10 13:52:25	What do I want more, €5 in my pocket or #glutenfree stroopwafels? #thecoeliacdilemma
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-10 13:58:42	1499 followers?! Holy Moly!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-10 14:00:17	@freefromfairy It makes me feel like I should be saying something a bit more interesting!!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-10 14:15:07	Less than 11 weeks until #christmas! *ducks to avoid blunt objects being thrown* Don't neglect ur #glutenfree baking! http://t.co/ghhWSEwT9f
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-09 08:03:58	So what was the #coeliac verdict on the pseudo-#glutenfree episode of #GBBO?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-11 08:40:39	@IngredientsPR Thanks, have a great weekend!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-10 15:17:57	@AmsterdamGF I kept the €5 - they looked like they were falling apart!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-11 14:21:52	Hello @SukrinBaking thanks for a really yummy #glutenfree lunch today! (Ham, cheese &amp; mustard on freshly baked seeded bread from your mix!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-11 14:33:47	Just the fact that pumpkins are called pompoen here makes me want to buy them even more than I normally do ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-09 08:55:09	@nels3 Yeah, I think they underestimate us!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-09 08:55:55	@HaloGarrity So many ppl think spelt is #glutenfree - even well educated ppl. Annoys me when it's not made clear it isn't.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-09 09:58:12	@HaloGarrity Apparently spelt tastes pretty nasty anyway. Will be glad when it goes out of trend...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-08 12:41:47	Hope you all know that tonight's #gbbo is a #glutenfree special!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-08 12:48:57	@GlutenFreek Ruh roh! #gffail I have no idea why spelt is so trendy, apparently it tastes nasty!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-08 12:54:02	@GlutenFreek I really hope they don't perpetuate the myth that spelt &amp; rye are #glutenfree but I don't trust TV editors...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-08 12:57:35	@gfreeb @GlutenFreek @GF_Photographer "the bakers must make a loaf using non-traditional wheat flours" like potato and tapioca? derp
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-08 12:58:07	@GF_Photographer @gfreeb @GlutenFreek And it's not even a #gf challenge. It's "make a dessert that happens to be #gf" WEAK
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-08 13:04:03	@GlutenFreek @GF_Photographer @gfreeb Haha! That'll teach me not to trust my Facebook feed! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-11 07:02:12	@freefromfairy Just been catching up on your blog this morning :D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-11 15:32:38	@nels3 I was very impressed!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-15 15:04:08	Easiest ever no mess #gf breakfast. Line silicone muffin case with bacon, crack egg into it, bake for 10 minutes. This may become a "thing"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-13 14:57:34	Coming up on the blog this week, a spicy prawn and pumpkin curry #glutenfree #dairyfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-16 10:35:46	@SukrinBaking Really enjoyed the cake mix as well - made a #glutenfree apple &amp; cinnamon cake with it.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-16 13:58:59	@GFBitesUK @FoodsYouCan @DeliciouslyElla @wbites Thanks! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-16 14:02:35	Thanks for the votes, tweeps! I came second in the @FoodsYouCan awards for best #freefrom blogger! Woop! http://t.co/BY1lBhXwsM
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-16 14:04:10	Congrats @DeliciouslyElla for winning the @FoodsYouCan best blogger award. It's actually introduced me to your website - you have a new fan!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-16 14:05:06	@wbites No! It just took me a little while but I'm on it - is there an error message?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-16 14:07:33	@wbites How odd - it's working fine for me!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-16 14:19:05	@wbites It was good - and at £1.99 a bag pretty good value. Would probably have been even better in a breadmaker though.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-16 14:39:06	@wbites I know the feeling! Already have Vitamix, Kitchenaid, toaster, rice cooker + all my baking stuff! No more room!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-16 15:44:23	Now I remember why I don't do many recipes on my blog. It's really difficult to hold a camera and pour at the same time. #mess
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-16 17:05:03	@itsgottobegf @DeliciouslyElla @claire_tulloch Thanks lovely
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-14 10:01:17	This week on @CanIEatIt I review @gfbarkat #glutenfree chocolate pillows! http://t.co/SixJ03AOGp
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-17 18:03:44	@IsabelsCuisine looks fantastic! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-17 18:05:21	@IsabelsCuisine we are coincidentally making crispy chicken with your batter mix!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-17 09:07:54	@IngredientsPR One of my neighbours received my package and I don't know where she lives! Hence why I haven't tried them out yet...  hmmph
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-16 13:59:24	@wbites @FoodsYouCan Thanks lovely! And congrats to @DeliciouslyElla !
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-17 09:49:35	New recipe on the blog! Spicy prawn and pumpkin curry #glutenfree #dairyfree http://t.co/nNpp8MV6GH
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-17 11:59:07	@IngredientsPR No, it's not your fault! The woman took it for me because I wasn't in &amp; hasn't brought it to me yet!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-17 12:19:34	@GlutenFreeRosie @DeliciouslyElla Thanks :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-17 14:54:23	Should we be naming and shaming bad #glutenfree brands &amp; products? http://t.co/2xXRoWmb1Y
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-17 18:38:35	@Celiacs_Fayre @IsabelsCuisine yum! I still want to make tempura prawns for sushi :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-18 07:22:51	@doddmatic Are they bad? I've never tried anything of theirs
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-18 07:29:02	@IsabelsCuisine Just having a deeper look at the website - the photos look amazing!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-21 09:50:52	Possible reasons for trusted cookie recipe to go awry - spreadable butter or using sweetener as a substitute? Which seems more likely?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-21 10:19:39	@gfreeb Doesn't look too dissimilar from the recipe I've adapting, but I didn't need xanthan gum when I made it. (and obv no oat flour)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-21 10:24:57	@gfreeb Imperial measurements make my head spin, I have no idea how much of anything they've used w/out going through &amp; converting each one.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-21 10:32:19	@david_navigator @gfreeb Ingredients are still all Dutch to me! Probably best off sticking to normal butter!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-21 11:56:38	Cookie attempt #2... This time I got off my lazy bum and got some real butter.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-21 13:58:00	Finally! I nailed the #glutenfree chocolate chip cookies! http://t.co/Hx1LoqSzE6
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-21 14:00:36	@CookieQueen1987 Do not talk about fat, I just ate 2 plus several spoonfuls of cookie dough... ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-21 14:03:03	@CookieQueen1987 I honestly don't know how skinny food bloggers exist.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-21 10:11:55	@gfreeb I'm using Dove's Farm, which has worked perfectly in the past. I do have some sweet rice flour in the cupboard though...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-21 10:29:47	@HaloGarrity Ahhh, a recipe meddler after my own heart! Sometimes I get too cocky for my own good! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-21 06:02:51	I was going to post a #glutenfree choc chip cookie recipe this week, but something went wrong and they turned out cakey, not chewy. Bah.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-21 09:54:52	@gfreeb That's what I figured. :( It calls 4 both brown and white sugar. Maybe next time I'll use brown sugar w/ white sweetener.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-21 10:23:42	@HaloGarrity That'll teach me to be lazy and use the stuff in the fridge, rather than going out to buy butter! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-25 10:12:15	#glutenfree choc chip cookie video should be ready by this afternoon. woop!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-25 10:16:42	My @CanIEatIt verdict on @SukrinBaking seeded bread mix - surprisingly yummy! http://t.co/F7Bbz5IXYl
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-25 15:31:25	@itsgottobegf thanks lovely :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-26 10:33:33	@k_rotchelle Let me know how they turn out! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-26 12:29:09	@k_rotchelle Wowee! They look brill!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-24 09:20:49	Limited number of hard copies of my xmas #glutenfree baking book left! Order yours in plenty of time for xmas! http://t.co/8fm8WH6qMD

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-24 09:35:14	@aw4268 Ooh exciting!  Hope you enjoy :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-24 09:59:09	@aw4268 Very nice! I don't think converting xmas cake to #gf is that hard really - not much flour in the first place!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-24 10:00:10	@nels3 Thanks for the RT :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-24 12:12:03	Just found out that they will be stocking #glutenfree #glutenvrij burger buns in McDonald's in the Netherlands! http://t.co/vtfvzh8vLy
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-24 13:04:47	@jamesentwistle There must be a massive market for it in UK, guess it depends on their own motivation to do something about it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-24 13:05:12	@coeliacme You should come say hi if you come over :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-24 13:11:03	@coeliacme yusss for almost 3 months now :-) http://t.co/5l65GTwOw3
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-24 13:27:59	@coeliacme It's ok, it's easy to miss a post! Really liking it, its everything we were looking for. Only downside is all the awesome cheese!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-24 13:48:49	@noomie82 Who even gets close enough to spiders to be bitten?!?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-24 13:52:46	Trying out a spaghetti carbonara tonight with @ThornleysGF #glutenfree carbonara sauce...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-24 14:55:11	@coeliacme Looks like Alex's contract will be extended, so hopefully 6 months, a year, two years? We don't really have plans to come back...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-24 15:01:17	@coeliacme I'm sitting here eating black truffle cheese right now actually...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-24 20:38:44	@coeliacme hmm, dutch cuisine is not really what I should be aiming for, health wise! Might try poffertjes though...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-24 21:10:03	@ThornleysGF it was lovely thanks! :) #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-25 13:35:10	I am definitely 100% sick of these silly #glutenfree cookies. Been working on video &amp; post all day. Hope it's worth it &amp; not too naff.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-25 14:04:57	The #glutenfree chocolate chip recipe you've all been waiting for... http://t.co/IpD4NgHuqB
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-25 14:17:51	@Mairebc Thanks - they really are!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-25 14:19:02	@nels3 Thanks! I did original try them with sweetener but they didn't caramelise to give them that "chew". Maybe a weekend treat? :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-25 14:41:27	Chocolate chip cookie recipe using @Dovesfarm plain #glutenfree flour http://t.co/WAhbbGtmST
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-25 15:06:52	@IdeologyLite Yeah, I react to gf oats as well, annoying bc they are very useful in baking :( Hope you like the recipe :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-25 15:07:14	@CupcakeCornerUK Ah, psychic #glutenfree connection! ;) Hope you like it.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-25 19:05:06	@EMCjoe Thanks for the mention! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-29 08:37:37	@baileybiggar Yeah, they are gooood! How did you like them? @Perkierfoods
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-30 10:30:48	I'm doing a bit of research for a post - trying to find as many #glutenfree #xmas products out there as possible. Any suggestions?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-30 10:49:47	@gfreeb Yeah, am doing that, but I know there are more obscure brands that do them too... I make my own so don't know many smaller brands
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-30 11:03:45	@TheMonkeypoodle Cool, thanks! :) Might be in touch for more details.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-30 11:14:10	@coeliacme Thanks v much!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-30 12:10:15	@coeliacme I think Bruschetta might be the thing I miss most about the UK...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-30 12:24:10	@itsgottobegf We're about 1h30 by car I think. Still, might be worth a trip one day :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-30 14:33:54	@ReallyTrulyGF Thanks!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-31 11:43:35	Frantically sewing mine and the bf's halloween costumes... can you tell what it is yet? http://t.co/VeONRj4nGX
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-31 11:47:20	@itsgottobegf It's part one of a couples costume...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-31 11:50:25	@itsgottobegf I'll give you a clue... http://t.co/NyoczXvjzt
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-31 13:08:11	@coeliacme The bf will be shark cat and I'll be the duck being chased ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-10-31 13:11:01	@gfreeb @coeliacme We couldn't find anyone willing to be stood on all night!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 08:06:15	Would anyone who bought my #glutenfree #xmas baking book be willing to write a short review for my website? Will credit ur blog/twitter acct
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 08:26:33	@Richmond66T My #glutenfree #xmas book currently available through my website: http://t.co/qUObiFoLkG :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 09:42:07	@Drinkmechai I think I may have done a while ago... have you recently changed the packaging?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 10:00:14	@AldiUK Are you doing any #glutenfree #christmas products this year?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 10:48:30	@AldiUK Thanks very much for your quick response!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 11:12:46	@incognitocakes Yeah, saw those, would be interested to try. Are you guys doing any special #glutenfree products for #xmas?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 11:28:43	@rebelbakery Are you doing any #glutenfree #xmas specials this year?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 14:21:59	This #glutenfree #xmas post is approaching 2500 words #eek #needabreak
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 10:59:23	@GeniusFoods Are you doing #glutenfree mince pies this year?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 11:01:52	@Drinkmechai Yes then I think I did - very yummy, but not tried the others.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 15:50:37	@ReallyTrulyGF No problem your hampers look really yummy!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 16:17:57	@coeliacme PJs are great for working, but they make me feel so lazy even when I'm working my ass off. Need suitjamas! http://t.co/agzfBbAvbJ
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 16:34:17	@coeliacme I'd take it too far and bring my foot duvets in as well. This is why I can't work in offices.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 11:13:10	@coeliacme Holy yum, I shall have to take a trip there!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 15:35:55	The Big #GlutenFree #Xmas post - please add comments, RT and add your recommendations! http://t.co/F68vvgQV5M
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 15:42:33	@coeliacme Thanks for RT! Just looked at the clock - have spent 8 hours working on it today :S Still in pajamas. Think I need a coffee!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-01 16:43:02	@incognitocakes this tweet got lost in the ether - will add to my post when I get a chance. Do you have a special link?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-02 11:06:54	@freefromfairy I love Christmas but funnily enough am not a big fan of mince pies, xmas pudding or xmas cake! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-04 11:41:17	@HaloGarrity Well, you have to be prepared! ;)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-04 13:35:28	@itsgottobegf They are the bestttt! I like to eat them straight from the freezer - they are like icecream sandwiches then ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-04 14:01:48	@McGowanKim Great, drop me a line at sam@thehappycoeliac.com and let me know which email I should send it to :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-04 17:51:24	@Fuelled4Fitness Wow, that was fast! Hope you enjoyed them!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-04 18:00:41	@Fuelled4Fitness Did they cook evenly?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-04 18:15:33	@Fuelled4Fitness Exactly! That's the spirit. :D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-04 10:30:18	Big #glutenfree #xmas post updated to include @incognitocakes and @Foodamentalists http://t.co/o9ydLYsl2u

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-05 10:20:13	@Richmond66T Wonderful! Let me know how you get on!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-05 12:13:25	Get your orders in for my book, #glutenfree baking at #christmas http://t.co/qUObiFoLkG
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-05 12:54:32	@nels3 Whoo! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-05 13:01:27	@nels3 Omg so jealous! After last's year's weight gain fiasco I've banned myself from xmas baking until December. Enjoy! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-05 13:21:10	Think I need a break from awful HTML ebook formatting, maybe I'll bake some #glutenfree chestnut &amp; buckwheat bread this afternoon...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-05 14:06:11	@MalSannie It was a random shop here in the Netherlands, but your best bet is looking online. Amazon sells several I think. Also Whole Foods
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-05 14:06:47	@KBowBristol @nels3 Definitely :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-05 14:52:07	@MalSannie It's very popular in Italy so maybe try an Italian shop if there's one near you?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-05 16:53:46	Going for Jamie Oliver's pork &amp; black bean tacos for dinner tonight http://t.co/TIrggf0Lte
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-06 11:24:01	Don't miss my big ole #glutenfree #christmas post! Lots of yummy things to discover... http://t.co/F68vvgQV5M
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-06 21:41:46	@nels3 Woah, yum! Love a bit of night baking ;) Let me know how it goes!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-06 21:42:18	@gfandfabulous You should get yours soon! (Since I'm in NL, my mum is sending the books out! ;) )
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-06 21:42:47	@nels3 May I share this picture on my Facebook page?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 08:26:44	@nels3 You did a great job! Thanks for a lovely review. Hope you and the family enjoyed it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 08:30:15	Wonderful review of my #glutenfree #christmas baking book by @nels3 http://t.co/Uh3qFn2aEM
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 09:39:06	@MalSannie Do you friends and family not love cake?!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 11:57:26	Hey newspapers, why not try writing an article about #glutenfree food that doesn't mention Gwyneth Paltrow? Go on, I dare you.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 12:59:08	@CurlyB56 Thanks for the great recon! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 12:59:51	@Drinkmechai Certainly, and I can review it for @CanIEatIt as well. E-mail me sam@thehappycoeliac.com
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 13:01:35	Trolling is the new journalism, it seems. My response to the "#glutenfree is a scam" article on the Telegraph today. http://t.co/XdZHpRNMO1
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 13:20:05	@UWLipow It's an easy way to get more clicks. More clicks = more money. Sad times.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 13:31:36	@musingdragon They should be! Think they are made with ground almonds, no wheat flour.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 13:37:33	@musingdragon Thanks :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 14:02:10	@musingdragon There are a lot of Italian biscuity things which are #glutenfree :) Never assume one way or the other
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 14:15:34	@freefromfairy Thank you!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 14:21:24	@freefromfairy I bet they are loving the traffic :/
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 15:06:46	@Fullergeller Thanks - it was a rather Mailesque article, wasn't it? ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 15:07:36	@SarahMaffews Thanks - glad you enjoyed it :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 15:08:37	@bintykins @FODalicious Thanks - glad you liked it. The only "news" to me is wondering when #glutenfree-ers became fair game for such bile
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 15:29:09	@tobite Thanks for the mention :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 15:35:13	@bintykins @FODalicious People sure like to get very worked up about what other people eat!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 15:45:29	@muffinandegg What country are you in now??
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 15:50:53	@muffinandegg Ah lovely!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 15:59:24	@muffinandegg Discovery are the most widely available. Is she now #glutenfree as well? http://t.co/39MfLaT2Z1
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 16:38:16	@muffinandegg Yeah, my mum only found out because of my diagnosis. Years of going to the doctor could have been prevented with a blood test.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 16:46:42	@GFreeRadio Great to talk to you too! Looking forward to hearing the episode featuring my very bad Dutch! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 16:47:54	@coeliacme @EJThurston Amsterdam is good, but you need to know where to look. Some great #glutenfree options here in Haarlem.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 17:10:17	@gfandfabulous I hope you enjoy it! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 17:45:58	@dsmith_edi Not yet but it's on my list! Thanks for recommending it.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 20:32:55	@Fuelled4Fitness @HealthJourno @GlutenFreek Haha, great article, giggled at "the rules" :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 20:55:19	@CarrieSquair @scottymp Don't panic. Eat real foods. Buy #glutenfree products until you get used to the diet. Make gf friends on twitter. :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-07 21:15:23	@DigitalCoeliac Thanks :) Just been poking around on your research - looks v interesting!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-11 16:18:59	#Coeliac paranoia: when you think every ache, pain or ailment is caused by an undiagnosed food intolerance/another autoimmune disease.

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-13 15:52:42	@kgollop @incognitocakes @nels3 @Coeliac_UK @GFBlogger Don't take any chances. Eat 3.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-13 16:07:37	Even after nearly 3 years of eating #glutenfree, I still REALLY WANT A TWIX *sulk*
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-13 17:09:44	@aprileskipp @Detoxinista Ooh, thank you!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-13 17:45:42	@CurlyB56 What are they?!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-17 13:31:52	@WarbsNewburnBH thanks! I've had to stop myself from doing any xmas baking until december! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-14 07:52:13	@CurlyB56 Ah, I was confused because it didn't look very shortbready :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-18 14:47:47	Uh oh. Running low on @IsabelsCuisine #glutenfree pizza mix! Must bulk buy emergency supply!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-18 16:06:16	To those who are reviewing my #glutenfree #christmas baking book, how did you find it?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-18 17:05:06	@nels3 great to hear! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-18 17:05:36	@gfandfabulous good idea. Dont want to make yourself sick after eating the whole thing! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-18 17:06:35	@coeliacme was it you who made the stained glass cookies?

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-26 09:45:37	@nels3 Thanks for all the RTs and mentions - I really appreciate it :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-25 12:09:13	More bloody stupidity from @MailOnline, apparently the #glutenfree diet is more dangerous than the "alcorexia" diet http://t.co/Eu5uLYX5qV
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-26 11:02:02	@FreeFromRecipes Thanks for the mention :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-26 13:25:55	A little bit too excited about a delivery due today which includes teff flour. Such a #gf loser but I &lt;3 teff!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-26 14:12:05	Everyone going on about the #breatharian diet doesn't seem to realise it's not a trendy new diet, it's the doings of a very specific cult.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-27 17:56:38	@GlutenFreeMrsD Thanks - parents and brother are coming out this weekend and we're doing a bit of an early Christmas lunch as well! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-26 15:03:46	@nels3 It's actually a freebie as part of a package to review, but will ask where they source theirs from.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-26 15:14:52	@nels3 Haha awesome ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-26 15:17:58	@FODalicious Teff is an Ethiopian (I think) grain that's naturally #glutenfree http://t.co/gOsLSUGeA8
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-26 15:36:23	@FODalicious It's particularly good in GF flour blends for bread. Reasonable similarity to wheat.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-26 16:25:20	@FODalicious You'll probably need to order online. It's not cheap but it's worth it (in my opinion)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-25 14:51:35	@thehappygut Yeah, quite disappointing, although I imagine DM twisted their original contribution.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-25 14:58:31	@thehappygut Still waiting for them to name one thing found in gluten-containing grains that can't be got from other sources.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-25 15:01:40	@StevenBCJenkins @thehappygut Did the BDA submit this to the DM as a ranked list or was that their doing?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-25 15:04:48	@StevenBCJenkins @thehappygut Thanks for link. :) Still curious as to why gf diet should be avoided for healthy ppl though.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-25 15:06:52	@StevenBCJenkins The article (on DM, not yours) implied it was "dangerous", not sure what @thehappygut is referring to.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-25 15:19:15	@StevenBCJenkins @thehappygut I'm just curious why gf is considered a "bad" diet by the BDA, is there any official line on this?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-25 15:19:36	@StevenBCJenkins @thehappygut Other than of course, that it doesn't help you lose weight.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-25 16:32:03	Swollen mouth + toothache is making me miserable, mostly because I can't eat solids. Need ways to make mashed potato more delicious.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-25 16:35:10	@Fuelled4Fitness Ooh, that sounds nice! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-25 16:36:32	@Mairebc You're the second person to recommend that - is pesto mash a common thing??
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-25 16:44:32	@createagoodlife I'm an avocado fiend so that sounds really good!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-25 16:45:04	@MalSannie @Mairebc ok, now I'm starving hungy. Too many delicious suggestions. My own fault really.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-27 08:13:28	It's my birthday and I'll eat #glutenfree cupcakes for breakfast if I want to
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-28 07:39:54	Thanks for all the lovely birthday wishes yesterday! All very much appreciated :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-28 09:03:48	@coeliacme try peanut butter + nutella + banana in a toastie... best thing ever!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-28 09:14:59	@coeliacme @CarrieSquair Banana sugar doesnt count though :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-28 21:11:42	Just found #glutenfree puff pastry in my LOCAL supermarket. So frigging excited. I swear it wasn't there last time I checked.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-28 21:14:58	@ljbarton But I know for sure you can order it online in the UK
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-28 21:21:45	@LadyRumpers Sorry, here in the Netherlands! Didn't mean to anger UK coeliacs! *hides from dribbling hordes*
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-28 21:23:09	@DecoratorH Schar!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-28 21:30:43	@LadyRumpers @sallyB_ I can get croissants but they are rock hard. Will blog about the puff pastry, fear not!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-02 08:59:08	Thanks to @ljbarton for a lovely review of my #glutenfree #christmas #baking book! http://t.co/1d8knDBbb4
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-03 09:36:06	Birthday/early Christmas weekend was lovely - eaten way too much food though. Soups and salads for me until I can fit back in my jeans!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-03 10:32:02	Much appreciated birthday present from my mum! #glutenfree http://t.co/9ubpLWB9Gp
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-03 10:38:06	@Geology_Geek YOU CAN HAS http://t.co/z9F59KMN2R
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-03 14:20:01	Random question: is anyone aware of any reason why coeliacs should not give blood (other than iron deficiency?)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-03 16:05:43	@gfcailin I'd assume as long as my iron levels are ok and I hadn't recently been glutened, it should be fine... but I'm not a doctor
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-04 07:11:01	@Fuelled4Fitness Just don't get sad if they get eaten before they're on the tree! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-11-30 08:40:47	Today's your last chance to get my #glutenfree #christmas #baking book for £6.99! We're making rum balls today! http://t.co/qUObiFoLkG
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-05 13:03:52	@GF_Photographer NP, thanks for such wonderful praise of my book! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-05 17:05:00	Ugh. This weather. We've had hailstorms with thunder and lightning, which I didn't even know was a thing. Definitely an indoors evening.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-05 21:08:20	@HaloGarrity Aww thank you! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-04 14:06:19	Not sure how I can mess up a recipe from my own book but I'm clearly not having a good day :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-04 14:46:38	@HaloGarrity I blame my oven that has two temperatures - off and HOT LIKE THE SURFACE OF THE SUN
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-08 13:51:03	Just two full weeks until Xmas! Now might be a good time to order a copy of my #glutenfree #christmas #baking book! http://t.co/SJTr7Ht6EI
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-08 16:39:21	@gfreeb Oh yummy!!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-10 07:44:50	Back from Denmark and picked up a stinking sore throat on the plane. Wish they would filter the air - I seem to get ill everytime I fly.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-10 10:54:51	@dairyfree Do you know what it's got in it? Might be worth looking into in the future
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-10 20:20:40	@WarbsNewburnBH Thanks for the mention! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-10 20:29:41	To get my #glutenfree #christmas baking book by Christmas, you need to order it THIS WEEK! Don't miss out! http://t.co/qUObiFoLkG
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-11 09:42:45	I know it's a bit far away but can someone please come over and make me some #glutenfree chicken noodle soup? :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-12 08:23:15	I'm currently at the "sounds like a chain smoking truck driver" stage of illness. And I'm dressed like a bag lady. Very sexy.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-12 08:27:12	@FoodsYouCan Thanks :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-13 10:18:01	@claire_tulloch Thank you! Have a great weekend! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-15 12:40:44	Finally put up our tree! Feeling very festive now :) http://t.co/cqlrMSBLEF
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-15 17:10:38	@Glutenfreewshop Ah lovely - do you have a shop in Heemstede or are you just online?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-15 17:43:41	@Glutenfreewshop I tend to cook mostly from scratch and dont buy a lot of "Free From" items. Dekamarkt do cheap gf pasta... ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-17 08:54:47	@Gluuts Thanks :) How did you get on with it?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-17 09:32:45	Amazon do free super saver delivery to NL on @IsabelsCuisine #glutenfree pizza mixes! Just ordered 16 boxes... #obsessed ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-17 09:34:18	@Glutenfreewshop I find the quality &amp; range of #gf brands available over here is not that good. But quality of regular fresh food is better!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-17 09:55:33	@Glutenfreewshop But I am happy to give you recommendations if you need any :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-17 10:03:04	@Glutenfreewshop I'd love to try your range, although I can't eat oats :( Would gladly come and pick up my order in person :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-16 09:29:17	Realised today I have been stealth glutened by a "wheat free" product over the course of the last month. Feeling quite sorry for myself. :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-16 09:58:15	@GF_Photographer Thanks xx
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-16 09:58:46	@nels3 Thanks, they were slow and insidious symptoms, so I think I'll need some patience, but at least I know what's causing it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-16 10:45:25	@gfandfabulous I have to ultimately accept responsibility since didn't read label properly, but it was quite misleading!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-16 12:03:26	@sallyB_ @gfandfabulous Labelled "wheatfree" NOT #glutenfree, sent w/ a bunch of products that WERE also glutenfree.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-16 12:03:59	@sallyB_ @gfandfabulous Didn't actually contain gluten, but "may contain traces of" and on their website says they are packaged alongside.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-16 12:08:36	Order my book, #glutenfree baking at #christmas, in time for the holidays! http://t.co/qUObiFoLkG #coeliac

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-22 10:36:09	@VegetarianMamma I put "The Happy Coeliac" instead of "Gluten Free Baking at Christmas" (thought it meant author name, not book name!)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-26 08:59:42	Just finished The Self Illusion by @profbrucehood - highly recommended if you're into psychology. Just need to reassemble my ego now.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-28 20:40:02	Busy making plans for the next 3 months - very exciting times ahead, but I need to get my ass in gear if I'm going to make it! #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-28 21:30:08	@freshney1 I think it's not - or at least not suitable for #coeliacs
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-28 21:36:37	@freshney1 I'm not 100% sure and the website gives a spectacularly useless answer, but I've heard others have reacted.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-28 21:37:01	@MiriamKhamis @freshney1 I'm not 100% sure, have just heard of others who've reacted.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-28 21:37:20	@freshney1 Hope you're feeling ok :( #coeliachugs

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2013-12-29 14:17:07	@happywombelle @freshney1 @Coeliac_UK Well that's what I thought but baileys are clearly covering their asses.

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-13 09:58:01	Another blasted cold. Can't taste anything so dousing all food in sriracha atm...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-13 14:05:06	@gfreeb what an idiot! There should be laws against waking sleeping babies...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-13 15:54:17	I seem to have something between a cold and the flu. Feeling dreadful. How do I know if it's real flu?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-13 15:58:38	@GlutenFreek lets put it this way, id rescue my cat from drowning but would leave the £20 note outside
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-13 16:01:14	@GlutenFreek that's what I thought. It came on suddenly &amp; I've barely moved all day. Thought it was only flu if fever present though
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-13 16:02:59	@GlutenFreek I've only ever had flu twice (in my pre-gf days) when I had additional autoimmune stuff going on
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-13 16:04:11	@GlutenFreek thanks v much. At least now it doesnt hurt to use smartphone &amp; bf will be home soon.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-13 16:08:05	@GlutenFreek it was so severe this afternoon I couldn't move but I can sit up etc now.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-13 16:08:54	@GlutenFreek will do :) I should train the cat to dial 112 just in case...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-13 16:12:22	@GlutenFreek yeah, hope so. It's been a rather germy winter.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-13 17:14:03	@GFreeProf @MayoClinic thanks!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-13 17:14:39	@4UGlutenFree my bf keeps bringing me home germs from the office. Ugh!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-14 09:40:29	Nope, still can't taste anything other than sriracha.

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-16 11:29:54	Some vegans can be really aggressive :( Makes me sad when I'm just trying to help. Wonder if ppl think the same of us #glutenfree folk?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-16 11:40:30	@Miko100 I suppose it comes down to whether or not you are choosing to eat a certain way, or whether it's been chosen for you...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-16 11:46:12	@Miko100 I always consider vegans &amp; coeliacs etc to be on the same side. We all have special dietary needs. It just hurts when ppl are dicks
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-16 11:53:37	@Miko100 I suspect that might be the case :/
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-16 13:01:10	I've revamped the #glutenfree travel section on my site - hopefully some of the content is now easier to find! http://t.co/53vKN4r0ab

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-19 09:58:01	@Glutenfreewshop Oh by the way, the new year's biscuits that @Glutenvrijemama made for me are called kniepertjes!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-19 17:16:52	@FoodbyHelen I really liked them too! Perfect for kids birthdays I thought.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-20 10:41:43	@daniglutenfree Aw, thanks :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-20 14:30:29	@RossopomodoroUK Are they suitable for coeliacs? (i.e. are there measures to prevent cross-contamination?)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-20 14:35:22	@RossopomodoroUK Sorry - have just seen the info on your website :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-21 14:51:40	Woah, some very enthusiastic pie suggestions!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-20 20:01:54	@muffinandegg They sound labour intensive, but yummy!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-20 20:21:16	@muffinandegg yes, some recipes seem to involve cooking potatoes many ways and then combining them. Too much effort!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-21 19:28:17	Making beef cannelloni. This seems very complicated for what is essentially a deconstructed lasagne
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-27 07:59:36	So many exciting #glutenfree things to review from this trip to London! Where should I start??
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-27 09:05:34	Going to be in the Kings Cross area today and want to try something new for lunch. Any #glutenfree recommendations?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-26 07:29:10	@CELIAlager  how was the bloggers event?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-27 09:15:21	@GlutenFreeZest I've already been there - is good though!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-26 10:38:21	@glutenthedevil I'm sure it's only a matter of time... #glutenfree is taking over the world! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-27 16:21:17	Not too impressed with @PeytonandByrne using same tongs to serve #glutenfree cakes as normal cakes. Kind of defeats the purpose...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-29 08:49:50	@gffoodie Yeah, definitely! I only didn't suggest because you said you were there for a day only. There's a great lunch place in Haarlem
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-29 08:49:59	@gffoodie Or I could come to A'dam
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-29 09:12:05	#glutenfree McDonald's burgers in the Netherlands?! Not just a dream anymore... http://t.co/V56Ydkk27I
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-29 13:51:07	Woah, @ilumiworld 's Spicy Harira soup really IS spicy! Good job!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-28 18:45:11	@gffoodie I haven't been there but this place is supposed to be excellent: http://t.co/dJ0QVNEaAz
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-28 18:46:31	@gffoodie Here's a few more options: http://t.co/PiGopTXDaK
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-31 15:37:30	@gffoodie Did I have bird crap all down my leg the entire time we spent together today... ?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-31 15:38:44	@gffoodie And it was lovely to see you! Have added my piqniq review to @gluuglehq
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-01 18:51:49	@gffoodie Ooh, swanky! Were they gf for everyone then?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-01 21:07:36	@dairyfree @BrackendaleSpa @DavidJ_GF @HealthJourno Hello! I have tips! What tips do you need? :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-30 12:22:58	I just bought a weird vegetable sponge thingy for my face. I win at #selfassessmentprocrastination
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-30 16:11:23	@gffoodie How was Restaurant Lieve??? Dying to know
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-30 16:16:24	@gffoodie Of course, dont know why I thought you were going in the day! Me &amp; bf are looking to book for valentines day, so hope its good!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-01-30 20:26:14	Apparently there is such a thing as quinoa vodka! http://t.co/mqRHdYUWK7
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-01 14:43:55	Just booked a 4 course Valentine's meal at @LaVinaNL - all #glutenfree! Very excited!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-02 16:46:10	@CELIAlager Haha wish I could! Waiting for all my #glutenfree peeps to come over to Amsterdam.... it will happen!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-02 19:28:52	@WritingByApril @GeniusFoods I am too! :D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-03 10:21:06	@HealthJourno @Vetty82 @AmsterdamGF Definitely recommend Piqniq (review on my blog soon). Haven't been to Eindhoven though
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-03 10:22:11	@HealthJourno @Vetty82 @AmsterdamGF Been keeping track of finds and recommendations here also: http://t.co/PiGopTXDaK
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-03 10:30:10	@Vetty82 Would definitely recommend a trip to Haarlem (15 mins from Amsterdam CS) and some great food too!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-03 10:35:16	@Vetty82 #gf is pretty good, if you know where to look. I'm currently on a mission to be brave and eat out more so expect more blog updates
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-03 10:35:35	@Vetty82 Also, it's BEEE-AUTIFUL here! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-03 10:42:42	@Vetty82 Most serving staff are quite aware what it is. #gf was never a fad here so IMO it is taken quite seriously.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-03 10:43:56	@Vetty82 The problems I've had are when I've been in restaurants where English is the 3rd language. Print out Dutch gf restaurant cards! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-03 12:55:40	Last of the reviews of @GlutenFreeBaki1 's #glutenfree baking academy. There's 4 red pepper &amp; feta mini quiches in the oven!!! Wheeeee
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-03 12:56:10	Full review of the @GlutenFreeBaki1 #glutenfree baking academy on my blog very shortly!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-03 13:19:36	I made quiches w/ pastry from @GlutenFreeBaki1 online #gf pastry masterclass http://t.co/rnO7lGxJ3I  TASTY!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-03 13:24:28	@ljbarton @GlutenFreeBaki1 They were very good! Hopefully no one will know it was my first ever quiche.... ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-03 13:26:26	@ljbarton @GlutenFreeBaki1 Who knew quiche was so simple? I had it in my head that it was a complicated process...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-03 13:32:22	@ljbarton @GlutenFreeBaki1 2 eggs, whisked together with buttermilk (or cream), poured over crumbled feta and bits of red pepper. simple!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-04 07:03:13	Will be sending out my February #glutenfree newsletter later today, don't miss it, sign up here: http://t.co/bB4TyfOTxC
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-04 07:03:59	@RainbowJules Hi! :-) Have you seen this page? http://t.co/qUObiFoLkG If you have any more questions, do let me know.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-04 09:58:40	My list of blog posts that I am due to write but have not yet written is getting alarmingly long. May need coffee and library pronto!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-04 15:47:11	@gffoodie @gfreefun Time to get in the #glutenfree #edibles market in Amsterdam then! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-04 15:52:18	@gfreefun @gffoodie "The VERY Happy Coeliac"? ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-04 15:54:36	@gffoodie The only half decent #glutenfree donut I've had was in New York. Was either @tulusbakery or @JWayBakeryNYC
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-04 15:58:55	I'm really starting to think buying the 1kg bag of chocolate eggs from Albert Heijn may have been a V BAD IDEA. But they're #glutenfree!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-04 16:19:43	@freefromfairy @DarlingSpuds Since crossed grain symbol is licensed by @Coeliac_UK I doubt that would be allowed?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-04 16:25:10	@freefromfairy @DarlingSpuds @Coeliac_UK What product?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-04 11:27:34	I review @GlutenFreeBaki1 at home #glutenfree baking academy! http://t.co/7DTsDDh4wv
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-05 07:50:01	@AuraandVole I don't have children, but a lot of the kids FreeFrom foods seem quite high in sugar.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-06 10:16:27	@Glutenfreewshop I'll give it a go! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-06 12:04:41	I feel a bit silly admitting I spent £6.99 on a konjac sea sponge for my face, but omg it's bloody brilliant!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-06 13:41:24	@freefromfairy I am: https://t.co/SER2yMVvYO

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-05 18:53:06	What a great surprise from @restaurantsumo! Thanks for the #glutenfree soy sauce with my sushi delivery! :-) http://t.co/xzihDaGKDw

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-05 09:15:25	@DigitalBlonde Haha, love it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-05 09:47:31	Wasting way too much time this morning giggling at That Is Not Artisan... http://t.co/SKOy4XLsqe
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-05 10:44:59	Writing about my #glutenfree #glutenvrij poffertjes lunch with @Glutenfreewshop and can't stop daydreaming about buying a poffertjes pan!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-05 10:58:33	@Glutenfreewshop Yes please!!! But now I am googling "poffertjespan" instead of finishing my blog post... ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-05 11:04:23	@CrateOfNothing Just discovered you guys. What a fun idea! #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-06 13:57:28	@AmsterdamGF @McdonaldsNL I know, they'd be huge in Amsterdam!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-06 15:27:26	@mcmoomin I know - they filled me up for like 5 minutes then I was starving hungry again.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-06 15:29:59	@honestburgers @CrateOfNothing WHAT! *books ticket to London*
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-06 15:59:38	@gfreeb Good thanks! Had a yummy meal in Amsterdam with @gffoodie the other day. How's the bubba? And are you getting sleep yet?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-05 16:13:32	New review: @GlutenFreeBaki1 #glutenfree baking academy! http://t.co/7fytvFsCIe
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-06 06:05:27	@noomie82 Don't worry, I hit my head on a solid wood table a few days ago and yesterday I opened a wardrobe door right onto the same bruise!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-06 08:27:54	@gfreeb @Perkierfoods Nice post! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-06 09:13:29	@noomie82 Coeliac clumsiness? (It must be a thing, right?)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-06 09:25:18	Finally finished my epic #glutenfree #glutenvrij poffertjes lunch post w/ the lovely ladies at @Glutenfreewshop http://t.co/HPdsO6zFj3

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-06 09:51:25	@Glutenfreewshop It was my pleasure! I'll do another review of the Lisa's choice range when I have tried them all :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-06 09:53:28	@Glutenfreewshop I just need to get that dough to rise!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-06 10:02:45	@Glutenfreewshop I was thinking about doing the pancakes. I've just checked the specs you've sent &amp; I can understand the Dutch instructions
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-06 10:03:09	.@Glutenfreewshop But I can never get my #glutenfree bread to rise. I have no special setting on my oven :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-07 15:35:37	@gfreeb @gffoodie The lack of sleep might be the only thing putting me off having kids. I barely function on 6 hours or less.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-07 15:36:35	@gfreeb @gffoodie Glad the little one is doing well! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-07 15:40:35	Remembering why the 6 months spent as a vegetarian caused weight gain - I'm starving hungry despite eating plenty of calories.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-07 16:11:14	@GlutenFreeBaki1 @beglutenfreeB @nels3 @gfhazlenut @happylittlecake Ah thanks :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-12 19:19:10	@muffinandegg Ooh, which brand? And which country are you in now?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-12 20:12:31	Finding out the fun way that overworked abs can swell inwards. This is what I get for finally building an exercise habit :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-13 14:00:45	@muffinandegg Hahaha, sure it wasn't a typo on the packaging? ;) Yummy. Want oreos now :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-13 14:02:32	.@muffinandegg Ooh, found their website, fake #glutenfree oreos look goooood! Nice find for S America! http://t.co/EPkmLqAjSg

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-13 14:21:45	@muffinandegg Yum, so jealous.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-15 09:48:25	Such yummy #glutenfree pancakes w/Nutella for breakfast from @Glutenfreewshop 's Lisa's Choice brand. Review to follow...

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-19 13:47:57	@judykitteh @AmsterdamGF The #glutenfree easter eggs at Albert Heijn are SO GOOD. Try the chilli and mango ones! :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-18 13:06:26	Can someone please explain why I was having nightmares about submitting reviews to @GluugleHQ ? I tried out a place, but forgot what I ate!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-18 13:16:55	Can we all agree that papyrus font is a leetle bit outdated/overused and we'll all stop using it for signage please? Pretty please?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-18 13:19:33	@BlijzSuiker Your blog is also good practice for my Dutch! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-18 13:20:11	@incognitocakes Coffee always good but I've had so much nausea after a weird virus. No cake for a while :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-18 13:25:12	@incognitocakes Thanks - you know its serious when cake is out of the question!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-18 13:28:05	@MalSannie But soooooo many restaurants use it (particularly more exotic ones) - if I see it again I may scream! :P

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-20 13:38:46	@michelle_phelan @GlutenFreeChefK No, but I have a lot of #glutenfree friendly places I'm dying to try!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-20 16:45:37	@FoodsYouCan Aubergine fries! Coat in flour, dip in egg then coat in flour/polenta. Then oven bake!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-23 16:01:14	#glutenfree bagel w/ chicken &amp; avocado at @bagelsbeans in Haarlem! Another one for @GluugleHQ! http://t.co/hE96HrypgP
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-22 19:58:35	Just discovered my local Thai restaurant is AMAZING. So good I added it to @GluugleHQ
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-21 08:51:12	@mrsdougan Hey! Are you coming this morning? Will tell you all about Hart then if so :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-24 08:13:53	Morning morning again... after 20km cycling yesterday I feel like I've had an anvil dropped on me!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-24 10:22:39	5 recipes submitted... 5 to go! #aglutenfreedinnerparty #ebook
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-24 10:24:54	It always surprises me when #freefrom producers aren't aware that a significant minority of #coeliacs can't tolerate #glutenfree oats.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-24 10:27:00	Now that I've eaten half the pack of chocolate seashells, I think it might be time to hit the gym...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-27 12:12:19	Chestnut gnocchi - they worked! #glutenfree http://t.co/bY4olPjZxU
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-26 08:21:59	There is a museum in Amsterdam dedicated to cat art! I know what my plans for this afternoon are...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-26 08:53:50	@gfandfabulous Yes, very much so! We are nervously waiting to hear about contract renewal but I would happily spend the rest of my days here
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-27 18:43:36	The first lot of #gf dumpling dough went in the bin, the second lot got hurled across the kitchen in a fit of rage. Think I need a cuppa...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-27 19:20:29	@itsgottobegf I think we're way past cake right now
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-27 19:20:48	@CovSheryl The worst part is they tasted really good (the ones that didn't crumble in my hands)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-26 14:18:52	@gfandfabulous Much more awareness &amp; gf knowledge, so eating out is easier (even in Dutch!) but supermarket selection is poor.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-26 14:39:45	One of the curators of the cat cabinet in Amsterdam, hard at work. http://t.co/KJlrbJAysj
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-28 16:38:53	@gfreeb Yep, I've heard that before - some people use taro in place of potato.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-28 16:45:55	@coeliacme @Perkierfoods Join the club! It sucks - watch out for the Tesco #freefrom biscuits - they contain oat flour
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-02 13:53:48	@EllaJChappell Ooh, yummy! I'm on the chestnut &amp; butternut squash risotto :) http://t.co/rYEOcKmXeJ
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-02 14:26:43	@PoppyBarley My mum is worried (ha!) that ur boots wont support my flat feet. As I have v shallow feet, is there room 4 a small 1/2 insole?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-02 14:30:40	Definitely feels like the first day of Spring here in Haarlem! T-shirt weather now - don't care that it's only 10C!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-02 14:36:40	@PoppyBarley Thank you very much! I will be getting them as a treat for myself once I've submitted all the recipes for my book... :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-02 15:21:12	Butternut squash &amp; chestnut risotto... #glutenfree http://t.co/8BfloTX9a8
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-02 15:36:55	@likeazebora This one is pretty comprehensive... http://t.co/jTJ2fMSIYK
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-02 16:36:31	@SachaCoward It's luverly! Not many tulips at the moment, but they will be here within a few weeks unless we get a snowpocalypse...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-02 16:36:42	@SachaCoward Why, are you coming to visit? :D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-02 16:42:08	@SachaCoward Since last August now. How are you finding Denver? You seem to be enjoying it from your FB pics!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-01 06:59:41	@gfreeb Are they all restaurants?! Wowee. Have a great time :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-01 07:00:29	@gfreeb Have just realised this is almost a year out of date so ignore my comment! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-01 07:22:55	@gfreeb OMG want to go to Italy so badly! Haven't been since DXed
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-02 18:08:39	@PoppyBarley Haha - will do for sure. I'm contributing 10 #gf recipes, but still kind of feel like a pretend chef ;) http://t.co/dXwpyBmcwL
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-28 10:44:29	Woke up v excited at 4am with a bright idea on how to fix my #glutenfree dumplings. I don't think my life is "normal" by any measure...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-28 11:10:52	@funfoods4all Making the casings from scratch resulted in a bit of "kitchen rage" so I'm now using vietnamese rice wrappers - works well!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-28 11:21:57	@CovSheryl What do you use to make them?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-28 12:12:23	@ButtercupBmouth What were the plums for?????
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-28 12:20:12	@ButtercupBmouth That sounds amazing!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-28 12:48:44	@ButtercupBmouth I think I need to sit down. Sounds scrumptious! (Also think I should get some lunch soon!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-28 14:12:59	Since the "pot sticker" style #glutenfree dumplings nearly caused a nervous breakdown, I've adapted... http://t.co/kAKAAira6s
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-28 14:38:22	@GlutenFreek I've made them successfully before... and I was trying something which was not far off from that one. But idk what happened!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-28 14:39:14	@gfreeb @GlutenFreek I am totally in awe of your dumpling pleats....
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-28 14:40:39	@GlutenFreek The dough was beautiful as I rolled &amp; kneaded it and then it turned on me...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-28 14:41:28	@gfreeb @GlutenFreek Is glutafin the one with the codex wheat flour?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-28 14:43:12	@GlutenFreek It definitely veered on the non-Newtonian side of things. Went from pliable &amp; smooth to weirdly sticky &amp; dry &amp; cracking
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-27 06:35:11	Today will mostly be spent finishing off my #glutenfree gnocchi and dumplings recipes and hopefully getting some good pics for the book!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-02 13:31:16	Chestnut &amp; butternut squash risotto - been taking pics for the upcoming eBook, a #glutenfree dinner party :) http://t.co/57C5k1EPSr
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-27 07:23:58	Wow, the end of Feb has really snuck up on me! #timetopanic
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-27 09:08:50	Chestnut puree successfully located! Now I can set about trying to make chestnut &amp; buckwheat gnocchi &amp; hoping they will be nice! #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-02-28 15:35:28	@david_navigator @gfreeb @GlutenFreek It's ok, I have it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-03 16:37:57	I really don't get pancake day. For me, every day brings the opportunity to eat pancakes. #yeahyeahIknowitssymbolic
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-04 08:23:56	@itsgottobegf Ooh, is it oat-free too?? Looks good!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-04 08:31:21	@itsgottobegf Nice, I shall have to try it at some point. Always looking out for oat-free stuff :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-04 08:32:05	In honour of pancake day, I had almond cookies for breakfast #grinch #IlleatpancakeswhenIlikethankyou
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-04 16:28:16	@hayleypatrick I'd love to try @GeniusFoods puff pastry but don't think it's available over here yet. Haven't heard any reviews yet tho!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-04 16:48:32	@theindigomuse I don't know about US brands, but in Europe we have Genius and Schar who both do puff pastry.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-04 13:26:48	@ButtercupBmouth She'll be 2 in July &amp; we've had since kittenhood. We would get another young cat (1-2 years old)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-04 14:05:38	@ButtercupBmouth Haha brilliant! Thanks for the tips. Storm seems to love other cats (and strangers!) so hopefully it will work out...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-04 14:16:50	@McGowanKim I KNOW tell me about it! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-04 22:13:40	@McGowanKim @gfreeb Humph. Why not? :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-04 15:54:30	After repeated trys, I have come to the conclusion that a certain European brand of #glutenfree puff pastry is just total shite.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-04 15:55:28	@CookieQueen1987 Had one come to my house when I was a student. "Are your mummy &amp; daddy home?" Needless to say he didnt get any money!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-04 12:36:54	@GoldenAppleEU I'd be delighted to! I also review everything 4 the @CanIEatIt iPhone app, which gets a lot of hits. sam@thehappycoeliac.com
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-04 12:43:40	Want to get Storm a kitty friend, as she's very social. Considering an abyssianian. Anyone have one &amp; are they good kitty companions?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 18:21:57	@gfcakelover @gffoodie I get asked that a lot by friends/acquaintances but never by restaurants. Why would potatoes have gluten in them?!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 18:55:11	@gfandfabulous @gfcakelover @gffoodie Not forgetting when I ask if they do #gf beer, "we do alcohol-free beer!" yeah, but no.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-04 13:08:18	@ButtercupBmouth Would having another cat who likes to play a lot help as they can play w/ each other? (already have cat tree ;) )
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-04 17:01:23	@hayleypatrick @GeniusFoods In the Netherlands! So it's a bit of a trek to the nearest Asda! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 08:53:45	@Diepvriesmarkt Ooooooooooh! :) (Now I just wish I had a bigger freezer)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 09:46:02	Photos for the #glutenfree chorizo bites recipe done! http://t.co/YJXwl8IQIL
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 09:54:26	@PineTribe Pickled herrings must be the key to staying young ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 10:24:44	@YorkshireTea What you talking about? That's the prettiest teapot I ever did see!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 10:29:25	@GlutenFreeMrsD Thanks :) They've gone down well with the gluten-eaters at my bf's work! How are you doing these days, anyway?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 10:35:39	@YorkshireTea You think Nelson would have settled for mediocre tea??
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 10:53:00	@GlutenFreeMrsD Also very sunny, very pretty &amp; generally quite nice! Just about to get a bamboo steamer so I can do my dumplings recipe next
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 18:11:49	@gffoodie "Sorry, we can't guarantee ANYTHING is #glutenfree"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 11:56:49	@noomie82 Thanks lovely :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 11:57:25	@CoeliacIreland But it's right about lunchtime now! ;) No rest for the wicked, got to do dumplings this afternoon!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 12:12:58	@CoeliacStudent Is barley malt vinegar not distilled and therefore safe?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 12:19:08	@CoeliacStudent Yeah, looks like you're safe :) https://t.co/ZKU9kYOFNg
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 12:21:03	@CoeliacStudent BTW, are you still in Manchester? I'll be staying in the Palace Hotel for a conference &amp; could use some recs for #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-05 14:58:47	@CoeliacStudent Weekend of April 12/13. Travel plans arent confirmed but if I have some spare time would be great to grab some grub w/ you!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-06 10:15:03	@gfreeb @GluugleHQ Me too :( Have a great time!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-06 08:15:09	@WeDeliverLocal Sorry, I'm on the other side of the Channel!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 12:08:47	Currently researching summer holidays - Italy's my #1 - absolutely nothing to do with the #glutenfree festival in Perugia in June!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 13:43:08	@issiwissy http://t.co/pyCVFKWOjf &lt;---- like the Allergy show but full of more win!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 13:46:19	@itsgottobegf Yeah - the adult rates are not really that cheap :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 13:52:23	@itsgottobegf I guess I have my mum to thank for that! ;) #turning30nextyear
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 14:04:02	@itsgottobegf Yeah, I should really grow up one of these days.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 14:06:12	@Glutenfreefest A bunch of us UK #coeliacs just found out about you and want to come visit! Is everything in Italian?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 14:26:54	@itsgottobegf They are on twitter too: @Glutenfreefest
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 14:31:16	I review @nakd cocoa orange "bits" on the @CanIEatIt blog: http://t.co/TJ3D7vfhmh
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 14:36:07	@gillilewin Ooh, they look great! Hotels a bit out of my budget for now but I'd be interested to learn more &amp; perhaps blog about you
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 15:09:04	@gillilewin sam@thehappycoeliac.com
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 15:10:11	@itsgottobegf @siobhan_norton1 If we got 8 people, we could get this place for €80 each for a week! http://t.co/mhHGGJV2j2 #totallyserious
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 16:07:19	@ilumiworld &lt;20ppm has been proven to be safe 4 coeliacs, I think ppl who say they react to less than this may have other food intolerances
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 16:28:52	OMG 2000 followers! #dontyoudareunfollowmenow
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 16:31:07	@wbites You are a cruel, cruel being ;) :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 16:55:40	@MalSannie @ilumiworld IIRC the studies focused on damage done to the gut, not symptoms reported. Heres a useful link http://t.co/7501SwofGV
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 16:56:05	@MalSannie @ilumiworld I'm pretty sure there have been other studies though - I remember reading them at some point!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 17:34:25	@GluugleHQ @siobhan_norton1 @itsgottobegf @GlutenFree4Tea Nope, definitely not too much!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 13:03:10	@itsgottobegf http://t.co/pyCVFKWOjf &lt;--- Here! Wanna go together??? :D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 13:16:54	@itsgottobegf Whoo! I'd just need to work out how to get to Perugia since I don't drive. It looks like the allergy show times a million
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 13:29:36	@itsgottobegf Yeah, but I'm in Amsterdam!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 13:30:00	@itsgottobegf @siobhan_norton1 Yes! Shall I organise a big group party? :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 13:37:11	@itsgottobegf Wait - is there an age limit for interrail??
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-07 13:39:49	Well, @siobhan_norton1 @itsgottobegf and I are totally planning a trip to the #gf festival in Perugia in June. Who's in? #coeliacsontour

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-10 08:43:04	Had a very successful trial run in the new tagine yesterday - such a simple way of making a stew.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-10 08:56:57	@GourmandizeUK A lamb tagine with apricots and butternut squash. Mmmmm
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-10 09:12:48	@GourmandizeUK I'm in the process of developing it for an eBook, so its not finished yet!!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-14 11:03:45	Pet peeve - people who call it "Coeliac's" disease. It was not named after Mr Coeliac! #languagepedant
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-14 11:10:53	@coeliacme @wbites @tracyattridge @LadyDinahsCats Do they do #glutenfree???? (gf and cats - would be almost too much)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-14 12:25:48	@LadyDinahsCats @coeliacme @wbites @tracyattridge Sounds amazing! Us #gf bloggers will be happy to give you recommendations... :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-14 12:31:51	@wbites @LadyDinahsCats @coeliacme @tracyattridge I may have to visit next time I'm in UK :D Although we have the Kattenkabinet here...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-13 07:21:00	@dietnoborders @GlutenFreeRosie @Coeliac_UK Argh!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-11 07:33:54	If anyone is interesting in coming to the @Glutenfreefest 30 May - 2 Jun in Perugia, Italy, drop me an e-mail: sam@thehappycoeliac.com
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-11 09:14:32	Sometimes, cake for breakfast is inevitable.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-11 12:17:28	@TalkingGoodFood @GlutenFreek @kgollop @toygertoyger Not sure but its not actively disallowed, unlike allergy box I think.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-14 15:19:16	@coeliacme @wbites @LadyDinahsCats @tracyattridge Its a cat art gallery in Amsterdam with 5 kitty curators :D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-14 15:34:16	@coeliacme @wbites @LadyDinahsCats @tracyattridge Do it! #coeliacsontour
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-14 15:42:54	#glutenfree arancini? Don't mind if I do... http://t.co/4nPVXWpwQx
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-14 15:48:03	@TalkingGoodFood Thanks for RT! And looking forward to the new blog :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-12 09:26:28	#glutenfree chestnut gnocchi success! http://t.co/w5MqeiT8lB
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-12 10:42:22	@Kazzy_P No worries, just wish I could recommend somewhere but I haven't been to Brussels in years. Have you tried @GluugleHQ ?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-12 12:45:30	@TheCoeliacPlate Wow, great memory! Looks fantastic! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-12 15:18:03	Tried to buy ras el hanout but weirdly enough it said it CONTAINED gluten. Isn't it just a spice mix? Couldnt see any gluteny ingredients!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-17 10:58:15	Must try not to eat the #glutenfree ladyfingers I just made before they make it into the tiramisu!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-17 12:12:19	Hoping to invent a new technique for making tiramisu - staring at the mascarpone from the sofa until it's made.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-17 21:13:40	This is what happens when you leave me in a room with @Isabelsfreefrom pizza mix and a jar of nutella... http://t.co/dMVPu3nLK4
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-18 08:55:20	"The Flavour Thesaurus" is an incredibly useful book if you are developing recipes. I've used it loads! http://t.co/pRdAAKaSBy
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-18 10:44:17	@4CandlesKitchen Thanks!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-18 15:14:00	@flourlessinlond @Isabelsfreefrom Which one?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-18 15:15:16	@ButtercupBmouth Definitely get it, its really useful if you know you want to use one ingredient but want to pep up the dish a bit
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-17 09:40:54	Making #glutenfree tiramisu today... I only wish I could bake ladyfingers from the sofa #tired
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-17 13:43:54	Finally got off my arse and made the #glutenfree tiramisu - very proud of my zabaglione! Now just need to wait 4 hours...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-17 13:52:06	@ljbarton @Eruditionpress Don't worry, I'll be making A LOT of noise when the time comes. ;-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-17 09:39:46	@FoodsYouCan I hope you told them where to put their disclaimer!!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-19 15:20:31	Pistachio semifreddo with ginger and lime. Another recipe for the book done!  #glutenfree http://t.co/aMUtcRwE7d
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-19 15:23:17	@KatieJHardie Thanks - when did you write yours?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-19 15:26:41	.@EllaJChappell I now have most of a tiramisu and a semifreddo in my fridge/freezer - help! http://t.co/YhLSWsdWgU
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-19 15:33:53	@KatieJHardie Wow, sounds amazing! I did the lot with my christmas book, only doing the recipes and photography this time!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-17 21:05:23	This is what happens when you leave me in a room with @isabelscuisine pizza mix and a jar of nutella... http://t.co/N9HzweGEB2
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-17 13:49:19	@ljbarton @Eruditionpress You can see some of the recipes I've already photographed here: https://t.co/eqoYKby7aq
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-17 13:47:53	@ljbarton Yep, "A Gluten-free Dinner Party" to be published by @Eruditionpress . I'm contributing 10 of the recipes :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-17 14:47:41	@HaloGarrity They worked quite well but spread out a bit. Refrigerating them for 15 minutes prior to baking helped a lot.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-18 08:58:22	Working on a semifreddo recipe. Pistachio, white chocolate and raspberry sound good to anyone?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-18 09:05:26	@foodiequine Very nice! Always so jealous of other people's business cards! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-18 10:50:36	@Chantal_GF Great, thanks :) How are you doing?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-17 21:14:12	@dairyfree It's just the way I roll... ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-18 15:03:47	@Chantal_GF Yeah, loving it here in Haarlem but we are waiting to find out if we can stay right now. Have you bought a house yet? :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-18 08:59:44	Or does pistachio and lime sound better?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-18 10:40:54	@Chantal_GF Thanks!! Can you get them from De Tuinen or something like that?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-18 10:34:47	Oh yeah, THAT'S why I don't ever make tiramisu #lactoseintolerance #pain
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-18 15:14:38	@ButtercupBmouth I don't normally because I can normally handle lactose!! Maybe my body doesn't like whipped cream?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-18 15:33:12	@flourlessinlond @Isabelsfreefrom I get mine on Amazon (super saver delivery to NL) but its on Ocado &amp; Asda
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-19 13:19:28	Got to the gym only to find that I had zabaglione all down my front. Smooth. #adventuresinsemifreddo
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-19 13:41:27	@gfreeb hahaha! That'll teach me lick the bowl like a savage.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-20 12:03:41	My mum just told me I'm turning into a "mini Mary Berry"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-20 12:12:07	@dairyfree I know, but the "mini" bit?! Isn't she quite little already? ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-20 12:58:50	@gfbackpacking Of clothing or cooking???
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-20 13:01:18	@gfbackpacking But I don't own any neon pink or neon yellow jackets!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-20 13:05:48	@gfbackpacking @tinsley2121 @kirsten__berman The distillation removes the gluten so its safe 4 coeliacs (although not the wheat allergic)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-20 14:22:13	@gfbackpacking Good - I can see the light at the end now. Kind of want them to be over!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-21 10:52:09	#ff to @gfbackpacking who is currently travelling around south america (v jealous!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-21 12:37:27	@MalSannie @nels3 @gfreeb - isnt there somewhere that does #gf icecream cones in Covent Garden, Carly?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-21 14:23:43	Just 3 recipes left to go until I've finished my contributions for "a #glutenfree dinner party" eBook. Then I can rest. And blog.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-21 14:25:04	Haha SO TRUE! @gfreefun "This is me every time a delicious bag of #glutenfree chips are sent to me: http://t.co/hb42UX4xoT"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-21 14:25:29	@gfreeb @MalSannie @nels3 Thats the one, couldn't remember their name! Thx
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-22 11:23:49	Have now infected my mum with my semifreddo addiction...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-23 16:57:55	Nice day out at Keukenhof today! http://t.co/75aU7oG7Dd
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-23 17:13:36	@itsgottobegf There were loads of tulips in Keukenhof as well! http://t.co/Pt9x5GOVnU
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-24 12:30:10	@McGowanKim I'm inspired a lot by world cuisine - I'm into big flavours! Been disappointed by many gf recipes, prefer to work out my own!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-24 14:10:06	@McGowanKim I find a few different variations of the same recipe then just add what seems the nicest ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-24 14:35:22	@gfbackpacking Well I try to follow mostly #paleo but do enjoy cheese and things like rice. I generally eat quite #grainfree &amp; #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-24 14:38:13	@McGowanKim I'm moderately synaesthetic and I'm convinced that's how I do it. Reading recipes stimulates taste receptors a bit for me.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-24 14:45:56	@gfbackpacking tbh, I don't believe that eating rice, quinoa &amp; legumes is going to do me any harm. But a whole foods diet is always good.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-24 15:03:35	@gfbackpacking I've been very interested in your food blogs! Would love to go to S America...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-23 17:01:42	@Chantal_GF Oh is it??? :-) It was lovely there, but COLD
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-23 17:06:19	@itsgottobegf No we didn't, but totally planning a tulip windowbox this spring :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-24 11:23:49	#glutenfree tabbouleh made with quinoa - yummy! http://t.co/564rfaM071
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-24 11:28:56	@coeliacme Lemon juice, crushed garlic, olive oil, salt &amp; pepper - think that's it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-24 11:30:53	@McGowanKim I actually find a lot of #glutenfree cookbooks a bit lacklustre in general. I prefer searching for specific recipes online.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-24 11:55:28	@coeliacme Ooh, orange would be nice! The citrus works well with the parsley.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-25 07:39:03	@16ChurchStreet @ShakespearesEng Great stuff - is there any info on your website? Definitely the first place most coeliacs look.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-25 08:01:33	@16ChurchStreet @ShakespearesEng That all sounds really good! I only mention the website so more people can find out about you!! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-25 08:22:51	@16ChurchStreet @ShakespearesEng Also, putting a little button like "Gluten-free options available" on the front page would be great I think
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-25 10:12:32	@Daas_Beer Do you have any distributors in the Netherlands? Would love to try your biere :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-25 12:58:18	Moroccan lamb tagine with butternut squash, courgette and apricots #glutenfree #dairyfree http://t.co/CrNtMEQWYP
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-25 13:48:32	@glutenfreegigi @TalkingGoodFood ANYTHING with harissa in it is perfection in my opinion! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-26 13:58:26	So many promises to send food to review for @CanIEatIt , so little food actually received :-(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-26 09:58:58	@funfoods4all This is SO MUCH BETTER than the Bob the Builder shapes. Next up can we have teenage mutant ninja turtles? :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-26 14:01:00	@gfbackpacking It's a sad life I live...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-27 07:54:09	@GlutenFreeMrsD There's also this place which the chef told me could do #gf but I didn't visit in the end: http://t.co/xQ1cdqMQ2e
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-27 19:24:06	@gf_traveller @gfdining @GlutenFreeMrsD @gfwanderer I just checked my photos - thats the same one we went to! (took a pic of the sign lol)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-28 15:55:09	Oh god, a new cafe thingy called "the chocolate company" just opened right round the corner from me...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-26 15:11:49	Donated my #nomakeupselfie to @beatED because poor self image quite literally kills. http://t.co/KlCddfJq7y
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-29 21:15:13	@CottonVal It was a bit laborious but extremely tasty! Worth it for a special occasion I think :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-27 07:51:08	@GlutenFreeMrsD @gfdining @gfwanderer @gf_traveller There's a place that does whale kebabs down by the sea - I'll try and remember the name!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-27 08:00:34	@gfdining @GlutenFreeMrsD @gfwanderer @gf_traveller Like a large, tasty bit of beef! http://t.co/Uj2u1biBM1
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-27 08:19:12	@gfdining Sorry, missed that it was for you - try http://t.co/xQ1cdqMQ2e the chef assured me they could do #gf but we didnt go in the end
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-30 07:24:20	@MirjamHolleman @Gluuts @AmsterdamGF @ingridkooijman Can't wait! :) A bit scared of how bad my dutch is though...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-30 07:29:33	@CottonVal It's one of 10 I'm doing for a new eBook (out soon!). I will probably also put it on my blog, but I need a break first! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-30 14:37:01	@MirjamHolleman Most of my friends are international so I don't get much Dutch practise! But I am very tired after today ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-30 14:37:23	@ingridkooijman You're welcome! Let me know how you find it. Great to meet you today :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-30 14:58:14	Just added @keekutrecht to @GluugleHQ ! Yummy #glutenfree high tea in Utrecht.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-30 16:01:03	Just tried to repeatedly tap on my laptop screen to make it do stuff. Think I may be a bit tired!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-28 15:59:35	I'm SO relieved - contract has been extended so we get to stay here in the Netherlands for the rest of 2014!! :D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-30 18:35:25	Laptop &amp; phone on the fritz, apologies if I randomly stop replying to anyone on twitter, facebook or email!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-31 10:11:08	@IngredientsPR @GlutenFreeBaki1 Yus I did - they are in progress!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-31 11:57:42	@coeliacme Make a list or pinterest board of everything u see that u want. After 30 days, review. (I know this doesnt help w/ sale items!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-31 12:18:35	@coeliacme @MalSannie After I graduated I basically survived on nothing but the essentials.  Even now I feel weird buying coffee!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-31 12:20:05	@coeliacme @MalSannie You'll need somewhat of a siege mentality. ;) I do know that there are loads and loads of great frugal living blogs.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-31 13:34:59	@issiwissy @coeliacme The only problem with Pinterest is that I'm now a compulsive knitter, sewer, dressmaker &amp; need room/cash for all that!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-03-31 13:37:03	@coeliacme @issiwissy Do you plan your meals?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-02 07:04:08	@gfandfabulous @gfcakelover Ooh, exciting! Yeah check out here: http://t.co/53vKN4J9oj
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-03 12:50:51	Last recipe for the eBook is DONE! Thai green curry! #glutenfree http://t.co/0gtyCrOnUh
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-04 15:34:50	Is anyone else as obsessed with the Frozen soundtrack as I am?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-02 15:14:16	Just ONE MORE RECIPE to photograph for the eBook...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-03 15:49:38	@freefromfairy @DeliciousCork Thanks :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-03 15:49:51	@AmsterdamGF Thanks :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-03 15:49:58	@itsgottobegf Thanks Sam :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-03 16:02:01	So these are all the photos of the recipes for my upcoming #glutenfree ebook: http://t.co/rEWoI81znl
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-04 19:19:31	@MirjamHolleman I hope you like it! My favourite is the lebkuchen recipe :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-04 19:23:23	@Celiac411 I still can't believe some people don't like this movie! My favourite by far is Fixer Upper
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-03 16:32:58	@MalSannie publisher hasn't given me a date but should be soon!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-03 17:03:44	A neat little guide to spotting bad science. Very useful in field of nutrition! http://t.co/5AkRtykp9t
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-05 08:47:09	@MirjamHolleman Let me know how it goes! Which flour do you use?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-08 14:47:48	@HealthJourno Hope so! I'm a bit of a pseudo paleo right now (can't give up the rice and quinoa!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-08 14:48:39	@GlutenFreeBaki1 @CrateOfNothing @nels3 @gfhazlenut @beglutenfreeB @happylittlecake @ljbarton @claire_tulloch Thanks!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-08 16:43:11	@gfreeb It seems loads of them do!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-08 08:19:36	@LilyMcInerney And yet still people keep insisting "But they're #glutenfree oats!"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-08 08:20:40	@annekeblair @Smallcakesop @paleomagazine @DigitalBlonde @MikeLong22 What were they claiming?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-07 10:12:13	@HealthJourno @GFtweetup Ooh, who's the person behind it??
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-07 10:14:14	@pientje4 @EllaJChappell They are recipes for a new ebook I am contributing to - coming out soon! (Sorry my Dutch isn't very good)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-09 11:08:37	@kgollop I didn't know @SweetMandarins had a restaurant!! Will try and make it there, looks great!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-09 11:08:46	@MPattison11 Thanks very much!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-06 18:17:23	@GlutenFreeMrsD @GlutenFreeBaki1 Thanks... just reading it now! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-06 18:28:46	@gfandfabulous @GlutenFreeBaki1 @claire_tulloch Thanks :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-07 19:49:38	So bored of companies offering "new" products made from #glutenfree oats. There should be some sort of anti-oat coeliac campaign. Bah.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-09 10:46:49	Going to be in Manchester this weekend (near Manchester Oxford Road station) - any #glutenfree recommendations?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-10 13:35:01	Back in the UK, off to Manchester tomorrow...!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-10 14:46:11	Always been a keen cook... #tbt http://t.co/eVqPNzZ94O
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-14 10:21:44	@Richmond66T Really glad to hear they were nice :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-14 10:29:35	Now that the recipes for the eBook are done and my QEDcon talk is out of the way, I'm DEFINITELY going to be back to blogging very soon! :D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-14 10:37:02	@coeliacme @wbites I do pesto chicken, roll it up, brush some oil on it and sprinkle polenta on the top... :) This looks great though!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-14 11:07:35	On Saturday I had a #glutenfree gala dinner where they gave me fruit for starts and fruit for dessert. I rebelled by sneaking @CELIAlager in
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-14 13:50:20	@Richmond66T Have a great Easter! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-14 14:16:16	@Isabelsfreefrom Just given you a glowing review on Amazon! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-10 16:10:29	Where is everyone today? It's quiet on Twitter...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-10 16:21:57	@JuliasGreenScen Hello! Ooh, you've got a review of the clarisonic on your blog...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-10 16:25:05	@JuliasGreenScen Very curious to try one - my skin is so dry right now!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-10 16:27:37	@gfreeb I'm very much in the UK right now, and the sky is covered with cloud... #LIES
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-10 16:29:59	@gfreeb I'm only 25 miles from you! :P To be fair, it was sunny earlier...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-13 22:11:00	@Richmond66T Ooh, is that the shortbread recipe?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-10 21:24:30	@hannahkristeen Velour tracksuits are super comfy though! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-10 21:24:50	@ButtercupBmouth I try my hardest not to ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-15 07:51:46	@gfcakelover I have a website that I use... Ill send it when not on phone
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-15 08:03:16	@gfcakelover Here's the website I use: http://t.co/rEVYC1dbBR
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-15 08:55:14	@ToujoursFishMee Obvious question - do you have #glutenfree options? :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-15 09:31:25	@ToujoursFishMee Sounds wonderful! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-15 09:46:43	@GourmandizeUK It says it's closed??
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-15 09:52:51	@ToujoursFishMee Oh stop, you're making me hungry ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-15 10:40:33	@GourmandizeUK Am I required to currently live in the UK though??
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-15 10:52:04	@GourmandizeUK But I'm in the Netherlands! Waaah
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-12 06:58:29	#glutenfree bread at the Palace Hotel in Manchester - actually quite decent!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-15 13:49:18	Just bought a raspberry pi and working out what fun food related uses I can dream up for it...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-16 10:31:48	@GFreeRadio To be fair, its only really luck that you can actually see the allergy box at all! I find the updated lists to be v useful.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-16 10:34:13	@GFreeRadio Sorry, I meant the new style of ingredient lists! Not the booklet/CUK lists - I dont use them at all
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-16 10:34:38	@GFreeRadio I get all my UK choccie from a shop which has them in original boxes so ingredients easy to see :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-16 13:38:08	Looking for #glutenfree recommendations in Copenhagen! Anyone?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-17 08:28:48	Right, think I'm gonna be going back on the 5:2 diet. Eating + weight both spiralling out of control.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-22 10:10:32	@Isabelsfreefrom It must be so frustrating to get reviews like that. I bet they didn't make the oil hot enough!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-22 10:28:42	@Isabelsfreefrom Yes, it seems that some people really have trouble reading and following instructions!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-22 10:40:30	@Isabelsfreefrom I wish I could write a review but I think I need an Ocado account...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-22 12:27:26	#glutenfree producers: do reviews of individual products on blogs like mine actually help at all in terms of growth &amp; sales?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-22 13:47:13	A VERY long overdue blog post from me, making some changes to the blog but all good! http://t.co/iduSB0PJet #glutenfree #coeliac
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-22 13:49:05	@gfreeb I've rethunk my position on reviews on my own blog (still doing @CanIEatIt though) http://t.co/iduSB0PJet
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-22 13:53:35	@gfreeb I ain't working for The Man no more :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-22 13:57:03	@ButtercupBmouth Thanks so much! And the tiramisu was YUM! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-23 09:03:58	@Mariet_Jans Yes, of course :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-23 11:06:56	@Mariet_Jans Wow, great! :-) If I had any left here in NL I would ship it from here but the copies are all in the UK. Hope you enjoy it :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-23 19:36:46	@DavidJ_GF to be fair, looks like they saved money by photoshopping the whole thing!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-25 08:08:33	@coeliacme @DavidJ_GF I actually use that on my face (I have dry skin) and it's wonderful. Cheap too.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-25 10:15:09	@GlutenFreeMrsD Whoo hoo! Congrats. How are the twins getting on?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-25 10:20:31	@GlutenFreeMrsD Yeah good thanks, ebook about to come out in May, just planning my next one!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-25 10:22:01	@GlutenFreeMrsD NL still lovely as usual - just getting ready for Kings day tomorrow :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-25 17:38:34	#Kingsday nails woop! http://t.co/7J3BsaBg6f
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-23 14:31:26	@AmsterdamGF OMG yes! I even try and ask for drinks without cookies, but they never do :( #baddutch
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-24 13:16:56	Swiss Airlines goes #allergy friendly! http://t.co/n5ONIjtU1H
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-24 14:13:14	I just received the preview of #aglutenfreedinnerparty from @Eruditionpress and I'm sooo excited! http://t.co/Oz0Msx22nu
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-24 14:44:56	@noomie82 That's what they are counting on!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-24 15:29:50	Kings Day coming up here in NL - think I'll be making some orange cupcakes to celebrate! Maybe with @Glutenfreewshop cupcake mix?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-24 16:00:58	@CrateOfNothing ME, ME! :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-04-24 18:49:49	@Chantal_GF Just googled them - they look awesome! Do you use the Schar millefeuille?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-01 11:06:13	@SweetDevotionUK Do cookies really *help* colic? :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-01 11:08:17	Finally, FINALLY writing up my @At_Vozars and @CELIAlager review. It's taken over 3 months. I'm a rubbish blogger. Sorry!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-01 14:10:10	Review of @At_Vozars and @CELIAlager from my trip to London in January: http://t.co/qWvNVN6O94 #glutenfree #coeliac
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-01 14:17:35	@kgollop @At_Vozars @CELIAlager me too... I think I understated in that post how much I want #glutenfree schnitzel.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-01 14:23:07	@kgollop @At_Vozars @CELIAlager oh god please stop now :P #hungry
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-02 14:51:44	Just ordered another bottle of EVOO from my dealer...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-06 20:08:07	@Glutenfreerevue @incognitocakes Brilliant - nice idea having a review blog. :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-06 20:21:54	@Glutenfreerevue Definitely! I'm dialling back on reviews for now - fed up with eating too many crap #gf products (not counting yours obv!)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-06 20:26:10	@Glutenfreerevue Taking one for the team! :) Doesn't help that I can't eat oats...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-09 13:12:29	Sometimes I feel like making fun of the #glutenfree diet is really just sexism in disguise. These silly women, amirite?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-07 07:57:35	@Glutenfreerevue @LidlUK No problems w/sulphites AFAIK. It's the avenin in oats that does it... many #coeliacs have the same problem.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-07 08:18:30	@GeniusFoods @mustntgrumble Yeah, they were good, but I thought the crumpets were better! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-07 09:07:41	@KatieJHardie Awesome!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-07 09:15:25	Restaurant review of @At_Vozars in Brixton, London: http://t.co/cRH2xV3sDZ #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-07 09:38:00	Just been sent over the Kindle version of the new #glutenfree ebook I've co-authored - it's all getting very exciting now!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-07 09:42:28	@Glutenfreerevue Should be in a couple of weeks! The tablet version is full colour w/videos though and looks fab!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-07 09:42:54	@sam65se @TalkingGoodFood @At_Vozars It's so good!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-07 09:51:59	@Rizopia Thanks! :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-07 10:43:59	@k_hidden_angel nope, just a quick rinse then boil like rice! I use a rice cooker
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-07 12:42:25	Can't believe I forgot to tweet the cover! #glutenfree #ebook http://t.co/VWGLXHpHTS
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-07 12:45:43	@McGowanKim I've done 10 recipes for it, but others inc @Allyson_Kramer have also contributed. #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-12 14:41:36	Inspired by @JimmyKimmel 's recent #glutenfree shaming, I propose asking cola drinkers "What is cola?"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-12 14:44:45	@jasmineeec I'll take the bait and say less.

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-12 15:45:49	@GFLife247 @GlutenDude @jimmykimmel Who wants to make a parody video? ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-12 16:07:17	@Chantal_GF Poor thing :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-13 17:35:38	@coeliacme @Morrisons yeah I am! :D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-12 11:25:27	@kgollop @coeliacme What happened to your blog??
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-12 11:28:23	@coeliacme @kgollop God what a shithead. Is there anyway I can help? I'm nifty at that sort of thing...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-12 11:38:23	@coeliacme @kgollop Hosted is slightly more of a pain and a bit more cost, but I think worth it if blogging is a serious passion for you.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-12 11:38:55	@coeliacme @kgollop Add me on FB if you want to msg me further about it :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-12 11:55:28	@noomie82 @coeliacme @kgollop I'm still very grateful 4 help with my book graphics in 2012 ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-12 12:26:37	Only a week late but happy 3rd birthday to my little blog :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-12 12:31:15	@Chantal_GF :-) We can celebrate with a gf brownie next week at @tweetwoodstone ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-12 12:50:09	So proud I can read the Dutch press release from @GoodyGoodStuff &amp; I love that sweets are called "snoepjes" in Dutch :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-12 13:12:45	@GoodyGoodStuff See also "gummybeertjes" :-) I have a q about ingredients, who is best to email (currently writing up review)?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-12 13:23:25	@GoodyGoodStuff I'm more of a summer peaches gal...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-14 11:38:40	#CoeliacAwarenessWeek is so fun &amp; busy &amp; positive and it makes me actually genuinely happy to be a coeliac. Love you all. What a community.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-16 13:31:25	My @CulinaryQ #glutenfree #ebook will be released on 22nd May! Watch this space for 30% discount voucher... http://t.co/wkl3RFaUQZ
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-19 08:47:15	2nd time in a week DHL have claimed "recipient not home", leaving no card or anything when I've been at home. :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-19 08:50:29	@Chantal_GF They got an angry phone call (well, as angry as I can do down the phone) and HOPEFULLY it will be redelivered today.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-19 12:30:16	Dhl I seriously hate you right now. Don't know when package will be redelivered so having to stay at home until 1 tomorrow. Life ruiners.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-20 13:23:52	@JDugonjic @DFreeFrom @GFexpo @FreeFrom_UK @LiveGF @Coeliac_UK What is the best way to help?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-20 13:43:31	@dncnmckn Yeah, quite a few of us in Haarlem! (not so many on my team, the enlightened)... It's really good fun, good for discovering places
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-20 12:48:46	Is anyone else addicted to Ingress?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-20 13:17:29	So they do a study of 37 people and suddenly gluten intolerance/NCGS doesn't exist? Hmmm....
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-20 13:39:39	My new eBook, "A #GlutenFree Dinner Party" is now available to pre-order on the Apple Store! https://t.co/ZwVKAQGvdl Squee!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-20 12:49:44	@GoodRichGoods Bit far I think! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 07:05:47	@gfreeb Beer is always a good plan though...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 07:24:00	@toygertoyger @barmycakes Someone else suggested sugar - which worked a treat!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 10:36:28	@CrateOfNothing Thanks - I'd also be interested in shipping to the Netherlands... if possible
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 14:43:22	@Mariet_Jans I'm so glad it got to you ok! Hope you like it :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 05:12:20	@Esther_lie_ @DigitalCoeliac you were in the study?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 05:18:18	@DigitalCoeliac @Esther_lie_ think I need to read them both before blogging about it...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 05:51:21	@DigitalCoeliac @Esther_lie_ Cool, thanks
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 07:04:34	@likeazebora Thanks - perfect fix! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 07:04:53	@toygertoyger @barmycakes Unfortunately I'm a bit intolerant to soy. :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 07:06:47	@aherneamon Cool! I've got a new eBook of #glutenfree recipes that's being released tomorrow :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 09:50:13	Is anyone interested in reviewing my new eBook, a #glutenfree dinner party? If so, please get in touch: sam@thehappycoeliac.com
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-20 17:27:02	Vegans - how do you mellow out a dish that's a touch too spicy? It's already a coconut curry &amp; I normally use milk/cream/yoghurt
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 07:05:39	@gfreeb Haha - I was thinking more of something I could put in to balance the flavours... sugar works really well apparently!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 10:19:18	@CrateOfNothing How often do you have products with #gf oats in them? Really want to try your boxes but react very badly to oats :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 10:40:29	@CrateOfNothing :( Thanks for checking though
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 11:31:51	@CoeliacDelight @ChubbaNia Aww *blush* But seriously, do it! It's easy and once you've written it, it's free money. :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-21 14:38:02	Although technically my new #glutenfree eBook isn't released until tomorrow, the page is now live! :) http://t.co/hVf7Tc3Miw RTs v welcome!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-22 10:23:01	Going out for #gf pizza. Purposefully wearing things that won't show when I spill on them.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-22 07:54:15	I wonder if the UKIP vote would be substantially lower today if the UK had won Eurovision.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-22 07:55:51	@Chantal_GF Yaaaay! So excited for #glutenfree pizza today! (And maybe some bubbly to celebrate my book) :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-23 06:45:12	@Chantal_GF @Isabelsfreefrom I should point out I tried to give it to her, but she insisted on paying... :P

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-22 15:27:44	We got #gluten cookies with our cappuccino so @Chantal_GF had to use a fork to stir as the spoon had crumbs on it! http://t.co/8qD2oRKNVB

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-28 08:27:37	@hollybrocks Is it meant to look like a koala?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-27 06:32:11	@sugarpuffish I'm just lucky that I live in a country where cannibis is decriminalised. If it's good enough for Queen Victoria...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-28 12:21:16	@AmsterdamGF Thanks for the mention! :D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-28 12:28:04	@Chantal_GF Oh my god, didn't I send you them yet?? So sorry!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-28 12:30:55	@Chantal_GF Check it now :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-28 15:16:16	Does anyone have any recommendations for good, reasonably inexpensive (something like £50-80) bread machines with a #glutenfree setting?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-28 15:18:38	@Chantal_GF I simply can't get my #gf bread to rise. Have no airing cupboard and no rising setting on my oven. So breadmaker it is
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-28 15:23:01	@Chantal_GF Haha not being funny, but seriously nothing happens when I do that. :P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-28 15:24:33	@Chantal_GF Thanks, think I'm looking for something a little cheaper though since I don't bake bread a lot. It annoys me I can't do it right
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-28 15:27:51	@Chantal_GF Haha Im on the exact same page!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-28 15:55:30	@Chantal_GF @Isabelsfreefrom See!! I told you ;)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-27 06:18:38	Remember those books about your period that used to say "walking up &amp; down the corridor can relieve cramps"? Yeah well, THEY LIED. Bastards
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-27 06:30:18	@sugarpuffish propaganda, all of it. we should get rest days and massages provided by the government.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-27 08:55:41	@issiwissy Thank you so much! :) No, I didn't make it there (life got busy!), but I'll be at the @AllergyShow in July!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-27 11:23:01	@issiwissy @AllergyShow I'm actually helping Isabel out on her stand but please come and drop by!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-27 13:08:07	Does anyone else find sweeteners (as opposed to sugar) give you a sore throat? #weird
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-27 13:15:29	@Celiac411 More so than with sugar?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-05-27 13:30:01	.@TheBilawal These quinoa breakfast muffins are pretty good! #glutenfree #coeliac http://t.co/xOYFzLuIuZ http://t.co/NLXaZJE0Tf

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-06-03 11:50:56	Now I have 2 oven thermometers to tell me exactly how hot the oven is (1mill degrees) I am going to have a go at @Glutenfreewshop bread mix!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-06-24 12:26:18	@GF_Photographer oh no! Sorry to see you go xxx
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-06-24 12:31:51	@GF_Photographer I understand- it gets demoralising sometimes doesn't it? You've inspired me to reach for the gluten crusader gloves .. :)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-07-22 15:09:34	@GFreeRadio @CoeliacStudent I think this is why these boxes are being phased out with the new EU legislation. I find them confusing.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-08-04 11:23:09	@Dr_E_Kendall Oops, sorry! I think I know a guy with your surname who has a coeliac sister! ;)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-08-05 08:06:30	First crack at #glutenfree porridge made with quinoa flakes was not too bad at all! Seemed to irritate my gut less than buckwheat.

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-08-29 08:11:00	@L_W_Hood We are thinking about getting a new cat to be a friend to our little Storm. She's 2 but still so playful &amp; gets so bored :(

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-02 06:41:17	Am I missing the point of drinking green smoothies if I have to put Nutella in it just to make it drinkable?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-03 07:02:56	Finally made a green smoothie that is actually green... And doesn't taste too bad! Celery, spinach,… http://t.co/LSi9Jpm808

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-04 11:59:07	@DauraDamm Thanks for the mention! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-04 12:29:19	@Isabelsfreefrom Its a shame Amazon are still stocking the old packaging though
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-04 12:40:05	@Isabelsfreefrom Is that because it would be set up as a new product?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-05 05:25:45	@GluFreeBlogUK thanks for the mention!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-10 18:44:16	@HealthJourno sorry, which tweet?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-10 18:45:46	@HealthJourno oh... Victory of gluten? Or something?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-12 06:11:23	Treated myself in the UK #tea #bettys http://t.co/GgWHnjoDWa

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-15 13:44:14	Hello Twitterites! Can anyone recommend good places to eat #glutenfree near Lake Garda?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-13 12:48:37	Need to stop eating cake... The judging hasn't even begun yet!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-13 16:08:19	A beautiful bunch of cakes at the @Glutenfreewshop #glutenfree baking competition! http://t.co/qtf4cZXHJK
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-16 14:15:06	Hey #glutenfree and #allergy bloggers! Are any of you guys on Youtube? Want more people to follow :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-16 14:15:58	@freshney1 @claire_tulloch Thanks so much! Really touched by the response :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-16 14:18:12	@freshney1 @claire_tulloch No travel company, just renting a villa near Salo. So we'll be self-catering but also eating out.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-16 14:18:45	@sugarpuffish Yay, thanks!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-16 14:24:29	And furthermore, if you want to subscribe to my channel on Youtube, I've a new #glutenfree video out soon :) https://t.co/l6AqokkJuH
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-16 15:46:07	Newsflash: tomato and cheese baked on top of vegetables may be yummy but it is not, nor shall it ever be a "pizza".
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-16 16:54:05	@glutenvrijkind @gillilewin Yes of course! I didn't realise you were in Lake Garda though...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-16 16:59:54	@gillilewin @glutenvrijkind Would be great to meet for a quick interview if you are around next week? What's the best email address?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-16 17:01:36	New video on the blog! Take a look inside my #glutenfree kitchen! http://t.co/nFroOkcnCF
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-16 17:16:35	@gillilewin we've rented a villa near salo but we'll have a car so can drive to meet you!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-16 17:19:32	@gillilewin Sounds wonderful! Will drop you an email...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-16 17:56:52	@CoeliacDelight Thanks Kim :o)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-16 17:59:17	@JillStrazz @udisglutenfree Probiotics, lots of water, peppermint tea, painkillers, electrolyte sachets... and weed (y'know, if you can)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-17 11:23:02	@ButtercupBmouth thanks for the mention :) glad you liked it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-17 11:25:34	@ButtercupBmouth oh, I still live in Holland but have family in Denmark and it's OK there (easier to live than to visit)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-17 11:27:32	@ButtercupBmouth yeah, I guess so! Danish fashion isn't very exciting either (like Dutch)... Just lots of h&amp;m!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-17 11:28:08	@ButtercupBmouth it's expensive, but not as crazy as Norway I think
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-17 11:31:01	@ButtercupBmouth ha! I am constantly rearranging my kitchen to make more room ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-18 08:23:28	More recommendations please! This time I need #glutenfree #coeliac friendly places in Innsbruck, Austria #glutenfrei
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-18 09:47:31	@HealthJourno Thanks! Did you ever get that translation you were after?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-25 20:22:04	Best meal of my life today. Don't think any review could do it justice. I love Italy. #glutenfree
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-25 20:30:58	@david_navigator slices of cured horse, zucchini gnocchi with perch, and white chocolate ingot w/ passion fruit. Divine quality.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-25 20:32:37	@david_navigator also, 3 course meal with wine... €56 for two. The bf nearly choked at the low cost! Review to come ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-25 20:38:40	@david_navigator salo, lake garda. I forget the restaurant name but I have it written down somewhere...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-26 02:48:12	@gillilewin Salo! Don't think we will get a chance to see Riva this time
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-30 11:38:24	@ButtercupBmouth Transcranial magnetic stimulation is not the same as "holding a magnet against your head"!!! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-09-30 13:08:32	Fancy a totally #glutenfree #coeliac friendly holiday in Italy? I interview @gillilewin about her travel company http://t.co/QxMxVy74is

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-10-03 11:28:03	@katwoman153 Is that because you know French or just your way of saying it? ;)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-10-08 04:47:10	@gillianoleary I know, I usually do with dairy etc, Think must have grabbed the wrong one!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-10-13 14:31:24	@HealthJourno I'd be more inclined to blame the journalists than the celebrities.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-10-13 14:11:39	I wrote a little blog about life in the Netherlands: https://t.co/KNVRVLmobM #dutch #nederland #Netherlands

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-19 11:18:22	@EmBacklund @gfreeb my recipe should be up on the blog this week!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-19 11:36:53	On my notes app on my phone, one just says "Blue gluten". Any ideas what it might be? A brand? A restaurant?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-20 10:36:45	Making #glutenfree lebkuchen today from my Christmas book, "Gluten-free Baking at Christmas". Just 100 copies left! http://t.co/qUObiGfyIS

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-24 12:24:27	@CupcakeCornerUK Haha, you'll love it! (I may be a bit of a lebkuchen addict too). Do let me know how you get on with it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-24 12:42:06	@gfreeb Thanks very much for the share! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-26 18:31:51	@EmBacklund do let me know how it goes! It's one of my favourite recipes ever! #glutenfree

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-27 06:49:42	@gfreeb thanks! :-) the birthday waffle dance has already been done many times! Gf waffles not hard at all
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-27 07:05:22	@gfreeb this one is really skinny... Tefal compact I think
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-27 07:09:50	@BreadBitchUK love my show cooker too!!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-27 07:10:57	@gfreeb I saw your post about le creuset &gt; slow cooker but I disagree! You can leave the house with the slow cooker on!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-27 07:47:56	@gfreeb they usually use about the same power as a light bulb. Models vary but that's pretty much why it's OK to leave them
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-28 11:38:46	@EmBacklund Good luck! If it's a bit sticky you can roll out between two sheets of baking paper.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-29 18:46:57	Just read the bb date on the @SCHARglutenfree bread, 15-10-14!!! Not impressed with @albertheijn http://t.co/WXBr5UWCh6

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-29 13:32:49	Bought a @SCHARglutenfree white sliced loaf, entire thing was mouldy when I opened it. And of course the bf didn't get a receipt. Huff :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-01 10:18:24	@albertheijn Thank you. It was the AH on Kruisstraat, Haarlem, and the classic Schär gluten-free white sliced bread.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-01 10:19:14	@albertheijn I didn't get a receipt so I don't expect anything but I want to make sure the #glutenfree section is not all mouldy! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-29 18:53:20	@martyn481 @SCHARglutenfree @albertheijn Of course when this happens I didn't get the receipt. So all I can do is moan on Twitter :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-11-29 18:59:35	@martyn481 @SCHARglutenfree @albertheijn I know, normally do, but bf didnt get it this time. Really shouldn't have to check dates myself tho

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-05 17:35:01	@Sweet_Virtues @beglutenfreeB @GlutenFreeRosie @GFBlogger thanks! Have a great weekend!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-05 17:35:56	Wine related injuries tonight seem to be escalating. Only had a glass, honest! #whomakesthreeleggedstoolsanyway?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-09 16:37:01	@gillianoleary Definitely! They seem to have a good selection - just hoping intl delivery isn't too pricey! Thanks for the tip
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-09 17:09:21	Writing Christmas cards! Catching up on e-mails! Brainstorming for novel! It's ALL happening Twitter.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-09 17:12:50	@mustntgrumble Charity cookbook sounds like a great idea!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-09 17:14:24	@mustntgrumble Well let me know if you need any help!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-09 18:31:39	@Isabelsfreefrom squeeeeee!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-09 12:34:51	Really sad! @At_Vozars "It is with deep regret that Vozars announces it's immediate closure due to funding being pulled at the last minute."
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-09 12:35:39	@EmBacklund Glad it went down so well with everyone! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-09 15:34:54	Is there a UK #glutenfree webshop that delivers to the Netherlands? Need some stuff but my faves aren't available here.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-09 16:31:52	@gillianoleary wow, thank you! Needed an alternative to Amazon as it was doing my head in!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-09 16:53:16	Why is it when people begin an email with "My name is..." it immediately makes you think it's a fake name?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-10 19:34:15	@putting_gott Hooray! :-) Everyone seems to like the lebkuchen the best
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-11 12:13:49	@Coeliac_UK Do you have a general e-mail address that I can use to enquire about the Vietnam-Cambodia cycle? Can only find forms on the site
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-11 12:26:37	@Coeliac_UK Thank you!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-10 13:49:28	@gfreeb Aww, you are too sweet. I think shipping costs would be astronomical though!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-13 15:34:00	Still in need of a #secretsanta or stocking stuffer gift? Look no further #glutenfree http://t.co/qUObiGfyIS
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-16 11:24:42	My cats appear to have learned kung fu. Think of the movies! I'm gonna be rich.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-16 13:00:09	@Mariet_Jans black treacle is the same as molasses, a dark syrup would work.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-16 13:01:06	@Mariet_Jans mixed peel is generally candied mixed orange and lemon peel... But I've only found orange over here.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-16 13:02:34	@Mariet_Jans and mixed spice is very similar to speculaas spice mix.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-16 13:04:42	@Mariet_Jans it is optional really, will just give more texture to the cookie, you can do it without
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-16 13:05:47	@Mariet_Jans no problem... I had to do some research too as I couldn't find many ingredients here when I first came :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2014-12-17 12:28:29	If you want to order my #glutenfree book in hard copy format it's your last chance to get it before #christmas! http://t.co/qUObiGfyIS

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-09 18:45:37	Guess what we're having for dinner? :-D https://t.co/0wXFMgoMos
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-12 16:47:21	@katwoman153 Yep, BBQ is grilling and grilling is broiling... confusing!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-12 17:25:34	@katwoman153 Someone else suggested "Backyard BBQ" to avoid confusion.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-12 13:55:32	Someone needs to tell my cats that Gladiators has been cancelled. They look like they're in training for it.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-12 16:26:30	Wow - only just learned that when a Brit &amp; an American talk about "barbecue" they are not talking about the same thing!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-12 16:54:56	@katwoman153 So if I were to write a book about #glutenfree BBQ - you would assume it to be the slow-smoked kind and not just outdoor food?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-13 16:14:34	I've been out of the loop for a while now. What's happening Tweeps? Everyone having a nice January?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-15 10:22:33	Can anyone recommend a good brand of vegetable spiralizer? Need something reasonably compact.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-20 16:02:25	Been working on a ranty post all afternoon, @HealthJourno should be pleased! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-20 16:06:04	@HealthJourno @kgollop Hah, I'm actually toning this one down a bit as it's ranting about food bloggers... #meta
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-20 16:26:03	@JoelSnape Seems like Proustitution to me.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-20 17:49:24	@gfreeb Haha, I don't think you have to worry. ;-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-20 17:58:50	@gfreeb Hey! I do that sometimes :-P
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-20 17:59:33	@FoodsYouCan @gfreeb Sorry, can't eat oats! :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-20 18:10:14	@gfreeb *heads over to gfreeb site to find something to rant about* ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-20 18:13:21	@gfreeb people that leave tea bags in the corner of the sink with an upside down spoon on top

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-30 17:28:00	Trying to wean myself off the desire to stuff white potatoes into my gob. Parsnips, butternut squash,… http://t.co/fFMiUcTGFH
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-01-30 19:20:34	@fliss59 I'm surprisingly satisfied after the meal (um, did have it with steak after all!). Baby steps I guess.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-02-02 11:26:55	@johnghughes3 @ButtercupBmouth I shall add them... I always call it bulgar wheat so seems obvious to me. :-)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-02 12:37:36	"Nooit rauw eaten" = never eat raw? I dont think Ive ever eaten sugar snap peas *cooked*! Have I been doing it wrong? http://t.co/TRbZT8VZdX
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-02 12:47:07	@crepeaffaire any chance you'll start doing #glutenfree crêpes?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-02 14:40:13	@crepeaffaire Ooohhh... I am close by your new Dutch location, so very pleased to hear that! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-03 09:26:14	Nearly made it a whole winter without a cold! Nearly... 

Still, quite impressive considering… https://t.co/zT96f5l6rQ
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-04 18:26:48	I'm ill and sad so I'm eating sausages, chips and chocolate milk because I can.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-08 19:21:10	I think my new least favourite food-related phrase is "guilt free". It's vile.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-08 19:51:26	@ArdsleyWooster @wolksoprano "Chocolate is a food, not a moral offence" &lt;--- I NEED this on a t-shirt! Hah! :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-10 13:28:53	@Glutenfree4kids @gfreeb @HealthJourno @IdeologyLite @wahaca Yep, I didn't find them to be very clued up on #glutenfree

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-10 13:35:57	@Glutenfree4kids @peterdominiczak @pandocruises Hope the Queen doesn't have any dietary reqs! Wouldn't want her stifling their creativity...

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-16 20:45:08	@Dansko Are your shoes only available in the US? I can't seem to find a single site that will ship to Europe.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-17 07:41:06	@gogoglutenfree1 @Dansko @amazon http://t.co/ddtazcZzmu still will not ship this item to Europe though :-(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-17 12:57:32	@gogoglutenfree1 @Dansko @amazon looks like I'll have to get my friends in the us to send them to me :-(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-17 19:47:05	@Glutenfree4kids @dairyfree Haarlem is lovely! (I may be a bit biased) ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-20 16:36:29	@hollybrocks Erhmagawd, I was in Cornwall too for the '99 eclipse! Id post a pic but it was v pixelated as it was taken on a digital camera!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-20 16:39:43	@hollybrocks I was the one in the Timberland sweatshirt (why were these trendy?) and a mini skirt over shorts combo.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-20 16:45:40	@hollybrocks Nope. Bang on trend ;)

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-20 17:11:53	@NictoriaTPott Indeed. But that's a catchy blog name, "The Shitty Coeliac"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-23 11:41:20	Super excited to receive @HealthJourno's updated book in the post! #coeliacdisease #glutenfree http://t.co/k5CQWyRavD http://t.co/J4W0EWg4l8
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-23 11:45:41	@nels3 @HealthJourno Yeah, I think it was the first book I read after diagnosis. Interested to see what's been updated.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-24 10:18:28	@gfreeb And here I was hoping the parents would step in and advise me ;) I guess A is still a bit too young for bbproofing though?

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-24 15:07:22	@josiemakes Ah but it's a standalone wardrobe, not set into the wall! So I'd need something that sort of goes round corners?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-24 18:39:38	Ermagherd, missed my 4 year #coeliac anniversary at the weekend! 4 years eating #glutenfree, only one cheat (it was very early on)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-24 18:58:45	@freefromfairy you can prise my carbs from my cold dead hands until spring arrives ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-24 19:01:17	@freefromfairy well, congrats, that's really amazing!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-24 19:02:17	@freefromfairy but do you feel better?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-24 19:04:06	@freefromfairy detoxing from what???
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-24 19:33:36	@freefromfairy just read your blog post on the subject, way to go!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-24 07:43:10	Does anyone have tips for kittyproofing a wardrobe with sliding doors? The terrors have worked out how to open them...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-24 10:39:31	@wandergfree Definitely! And I still have those breakdowns from time to time ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-24 16:11:03	@WesternDaily Link isn't working :(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-26 11:55:24	Are there any unmissable #glutenfree places in #Oxford? Recommendations please!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-03-26 20:04:34	@gfreeb more detail plz!!!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-04 18:55:38	Streusel cake. Easily gluten-freeable... http://t.co/IeW9H3iQAh
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-04 18:58:52	@mustntgrumble I used blueberries... Such addictive cake!!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-04 19:00:37	@mustntgrumble it's like they thought "what could improve this cake? More sugar and butter? Sure!"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-04 19:25:32	.@mustntgrumble butter is great for anticipating a famine.

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-14 13:53:08	Made the mistake of trying to find summery tees in H&amp;M and Zara. I am now so filled with a fiery rage that I need to go punch something.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-17 13:18:03	@issiwissy Indeed. I wrote the post because I thought it was important that people realised the social consequences of CD
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-17 13:22:56	@issiwissy Exactly! I'd call myself a hypochondriac but really we DO have a higher chance than most of associated complication/other disease
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-17 14:10:30	@GlutenFreeMrsD Yep, I think so. There were also pig's ears :D
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-17 14:11:13	@GlutenFreeMrsD Thanks for the mention :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-17 14:12:11	@lovethingsgf It should be on every #freefrom aisle everywhere!!!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-17 14:14:11	@Harriet__Vane Thanks :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-17 14:14:41	@GlutenFreeMrsD I chose instead to go for Schar's version of Hit biscuits - a childhood favourite ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-17 14:16:46	@candiceinslc @issiwissy Thank you. Yay for the happy c(o)eliacs!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-17 14:23:35	@GlutenFreeMrsD Choc cream in the middle, normal vanilla biscuits on the outside. Pretty good substitute!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-17 13:03:21	@RobocapFriend My partner knows the awful consequences of a mistake when there's 1 toilet... so we have very little gluten at home. ;)

2) Grilled peaches with balsamic, brown sugar and rosemary
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-28 15:45:36	@itsgottobegf Hmmm, good point. I guess I'll have to do several taste tests to find out ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-04-28 15:40:57	@AlexandraJacks :D You can do whatever you want. Believe in your dreams.

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-15 08:59:37	Is the term "pre-prepared" a tautology? I can't brain this morning.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-15 10:45:31	What happens when you tell people you can't eat gluten http://t.co/Zaz84kZwZr #glutenfree #CoeliacAwarenessWeek
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-18 10:50:49	So, twitter, I'm off to London tomorrow. What's been the most exciting #glutenfree developments since I left 2 years ago?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-18 11:14:16	@McGowanKim Unfortunately not going for #glutenfree pleasure, but desperate to get some good food in during that time! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-19 06:16:37	@MyGlutenFreeLDN sorry, on android!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-18 11:15:08	15 #coeliacs share their tips for #glutenfree newbies http://t.co/hNozdXA5ng
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-18 11:15:34	@CantSwingACat Cool, have tweeted it!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-18 11:15:52	@brisbakehouse @MO_LONDON I may have to *make* some time for that! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-18 11:18:58	@wandergfree @beyond_bread @RomeosGFBakery @La_Polenteria @Nichefooddrink Wowsers, thanks! Have only tried @honestburgers so far!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-18 11:40:15	I could look at this for hours. Think I might need a poster for my bathroom.

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-18 12:55:27	@MO_LONDON Thanks very much!

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-20 07:11:58	The hunger games: catching a bite to eat #coeliacfilms  @DavidJ_GF
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-21 11:52:12	@gfreeb @Ascot I'd be furious if they took away food I'd brought and left me hangry...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-30 10:35:03	Back from the uk and just whipped up some savoury #glutenfree breakfast muffins. Might need to tweak… https://t.co/JdOr8YKKuO
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-30 10:41:18	Sadly enough only made it to one new (to me) #glutenfree place while in London... @hbros was well worth it! My new favourite lunch place.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-31 16:31:36	@david_navigator @kgollop groups can be very tricky in Amsterdam... I'll have a think about where might be good and get back to you!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-31 16:33:07	@wbites @AllergyShow @gfreeb @kgollop @McGowanKim @CoeliacStudent @freefromfairy @gfcuppatea @GFBlogger @noomie82  I hope to be there!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-31 16:37:36	Off to Cantina023 AGAIN. #glutenvrij #haarlem #glutenfree #texmex
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-05-31 16:41:32	@kgollop TBH Barbara (@AmsterdamGF) is probably best to ask - I don't eat out in Amsterdam much. But I'll have a think all the same.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-01 08:57:39	I'm a couple of weeks away from finishing my #glutenfree #bbq #ebook ! Sign up for updates &amp; be the first to know! http://t.co/NovJwVRuTg
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-01 13:02:11	@kgollop @GlutenFreeMrsD @GFAmsterdam I would like to bet good money that you will not need your translation cards once ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-01 14:39:18	Trying out my all-purpose spice rub recipe from my upcoming #glutenfree #bbq book. Covered an entire chicken in it. Expecting greatness.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-02 15:10:29	@GFCoachAndrea I totally misread that as "black cat"...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-02 16:00:50	Doing the photos for the Korean galbi marinade for upcoming #glutenfree #bbq book. Hungry for dinner now! ;) http://t.co/mmfuhzLxyU

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-02 16:38:06	@wandergfree no problem :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-03 15:57:59	Doing the photos today for my all-purpose spice rub for bbqs. #glutenfree #bbq https://t.co/0ZIS4ip8wG
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-04 08:40:36	I actually think I got mildly glutened by my drink glasses at a bar last night. I only saw how they were "washed" too late :-(
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-04 08:46:38	@wandergfree they rinsed the glasses in what could only be described as "filthy beer water". Sadly I only noticed this on my 3rd iced tea
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-04 08:50:03	@wandergfree it seems relatively mild.... Slept in until 10 though. Oops
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-04 08:55:16	@wandergfree it was largely because I couldn't keep my eyes open. Normally an early riser.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-06 16:34:19	New post: "so, like, how sensitive ARE you?" http://t.co/nm37J7xNVT #glutenfree #coeliacquestions

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-06 20:38:16	Does getting glutened cause anyone else to bloat like crazy for days?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-06 20:56:01	@ButtercupBmouth I did get caught... By badly washed beer glasses :( bf took a picture of me today and I was shocked
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-08 07:47:33	@WheatFreeWookie 6 days! :O
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-08 07:48:33	@fruitisnotapud @leanneehren The fatigue is the worst. Still trying to work out whether I'm still fatigued... or just lazy on a Monday morn
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-08 07:48:51	@grumpycoeliac It's been 5 days and I'm only just starting to go down!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-08 07:49:41	@linnas79 Love that image! :P Is it such a violent reaction even after a very small amount?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-08 07:52:24	@fruitisnotapud Good idea to limit dairy - I try not to eat too much anyway. Love your Twitter handle btw! :)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-08 09:33:54	@fruitisnotapud I love my (full fat) yoghurt, it doesn't seem to upset my stomach. Too much cheese however... is another story ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-08 09:36:01	Been busy few weeks taking pics 4 new #glutenfree #bbq book. To signup 4 updates, follow link! http://t.co/1WjfYyBLdP http://t.co/C9GsM0BlNf
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-08 10:07:05	@linnas79 Yeah, my reactions get stronger to smaller amounts of gluten too!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-08 15:01:26	@linnas79 I don't think there's any evidence that this works for coeliac disease, but by all means talk to the doctor about it.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-09 07:51:52	Ermagerd! #glutenfree fresh pasta available in even my little local Albert Heijn! #glutenvrij https://t.co/pQlRRiM2rX

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-12 01:33:09	McDonald’s extends gluten-free availability to 50 branches across the... http://t.co/AhrBHqDDlf on @bloglovin
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-11 16:08:32	@fliss59 yeah I totally understand. Might print out a few copies but it's rather expensive if you self publish...
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-12 07:32:00	New post! @McdonaldsNL extend availability of #glutenfree burgers to 50 branches: http://t.co/nLM8Z5KywF

755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-12 10:18:52	Portobello mushrooms stuffed with wild rice &amp; curried lentils. For my #glutenfree #bbq ebook. #vegetarian #vegan http://t.co/ksNFQSAKnE
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-11 15:16:39	Only 4 more recipes left to photograph for the #glutenfree #bbq book... Hope to get it up on the Kindle store in just over a week!
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-11 15:45:28	@fliss59 yep, in epub and PDF through my site and then hopefully on ibooks.
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-11 15:47:50	@fliss59 which format is best for you?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-12 20:53:57	This spring has left me totally unprepared for any kind of heat. How do I sleep when it's 25C indoors??
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-12 21:13:08	@springcolorshop do you live in the sun???
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-12 21:29:02	@springcolorshop don't you just crank up the a/c?
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-12 22:00:06	@springcolorshop Dutch houses are designed to trap as much heat in them as possible. No one ever thought "hey what happens in the summer?"
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-12 15:11:58	#glutenfree availability in @McdonaldsNL just got a whole lot bigger: http://t.co/nLM8Z5KywF
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-12 15:16:27	This. Is. Amazing. https://t.co/PrgEwisKfP
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-12 19:05:44	@GFBartender @johnrampton @dfreithedogguy it's 25C in my house. I NEED someone to make me this! ;)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-15 08:25:09	@GFGathering Can I be put in the loop about @AllergyShow festivities? I've booked my flights now so I'll definitely be there :-)
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-14 12:27:55	I SENT MY BBQ BOOK OFF TO THE EDITOR! WHOOOO
755005608	TheHappyCoeliac	2015-06-17 07:31:19	Any chance @crepeaffaire you'll be doing #glutenfree in your Haarlem store?
