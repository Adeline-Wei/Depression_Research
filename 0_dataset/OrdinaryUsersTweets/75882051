75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-22 04:06:25	@Monotarium_EP I have it, jackass.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-22 04:18:21	I miss when you cared.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-22 04:26:13	Sometimes I can't stand you, and sometimes it feels like I can't stand without you...
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-22 04:26:47	@abby_diane14 We need to hang out!
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-22 05:16:46	@abby_diane14 All right! We definitely will. :)
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-22 05:17:41	You say that you love me, and I end up lying and say I love you too.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-22 05:18:32	We sure make it feel like we're together 'cause we can't stand to see each other with somebody else.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-22 05:26:45	I wish you texted me when I was upset like I texted you when you were.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-22 05:27:08	But it is 110% to 40%. Always.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-22 05:35:02	I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I HATE THIS.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-22 05:36:42	You don't love me like I love you.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-22 05:46:02	FUCK THIS. You're making it so hard to keep you.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-22 08:07:48	People always talk. STOP SPREADING BULLSHIT. Do you not realize that's someone else's LIFE?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-22 08:27:44	I care too much about what people think
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-22 08:45:55	I hate "okay". TALK. I don't text you just to keep getting the same fucking word over and over again.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-24 13:30:48	Maybe I'm a masochist. I try to run, but I don't want to ever leave.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-24 13:38:15	Need a song to look up !
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-24 13:41:06	I can't stop thinkin' 'bout, thinkin' 'bout us anymore.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-24 13:42:00	I had the week that came from hell.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-06-24 13:42:22	You're like the net under the ledge. When I go flying off, you go flying off as well. &lt;3
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-10 21:38:27	@abby_diane14 I don't have your number. :( message me on Facebook with it :-)
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-11 01:02:48	Don't pick favorites in between your kids. That's not okay.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-12 03:33:52	Instagram?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-12 01:27:54	Your pride, your ego, your needs, and your selfish ways caused a good, strong woman like me to walk out your life..
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-12 07:54:07	I'm tired as fuck
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-12 02:26:02	@RonnieRadke I struggled with it for a very, very long time.. I'm going on 4 months without doing it! :-)
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-13 01:31:14	Smile like you don't give a damn about the consequence.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-13 21:22:18	I really want some pizza.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-12 23:22:54	I'm absolutely in love with the song "The Day I Left The Womb" by Escape The Fate. They aren't the same anymore without @RonnieRadke though.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-13 10:29:38	I'm tired of hurting...
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-16 06:39:53	My heart's more scarred, more scarred than my wrist is.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-15 07:37:41	Religion is like a penis. You may have one, but out doesn't mean it whip it out in public or shove it down my throat. @ashiepooh1026
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-17 01:30:05	I really want chocolate.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-17 01:45:22	I put chocolate syrup in my coffee...it its actually pretty amazing.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-17 02:23:34	P.S. I Love You makes me cry every time.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-17 02:53:40	The silence is slowly killing me.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-17 02:57:03	Love is more than anything.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-17 02:57:12	A heart can change the world.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-17 06:21:02	@RonnieRadke Because you were meant for a bigger purpose. You have inspired so many people omit self harm from their lives. You're a hero.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-18 23:38:47	I'm really feeling some chocolate chip cookies right now.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-07-24 04:32:06	I don't know what to do anymore..
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-09 14:32:21	I want coffee, but I hate coffee breath. Ya feel me?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-14 14:01:01	Call me maybeeee.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-15 14:28:40	So sick of love songs. So tired of tears. So done with wishing you were still here.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-15 14:30:10	It needs to be Friday already. Ya feel me?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-16 14:20:43	But seriously. Fuck you.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-16 14:24:43	Stand tall. Be strong.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-16 14:26:59	Being sad doesn't make it better. Put a smile on your face! It will. :)
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-15 14:18:34	Swiss rolls and tea for breakfast? Fuck yeah. My day is going great.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-15 14:34:59	Decisions, decisions.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-19 14:24:57	Maybe I should cry for help. Maybe I should kill myself.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-19 14:38:59	I want the day to be over .
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-19 14:39:16	I'm sick of this ratchet, fake ass school already, and it is only 2nd period.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-16 14:22:40	I need a cigarette.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-16 14:11:54	I'm so hungry.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-16 14:14:11	I want my chips.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-21 14:33:59	Thinking about moving to Creekwood.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-23 17:42:13	Baby, I'm slowly falling out of love with you. I don't know what to do.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-23 18:01:33	You're just some racist that can't tie my laces.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-23 17:53:44	It sure would be prettier with you..
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-23 17:43:06	Sometimes, I feel like there's no getting through to you. Like you don't appreciate all that I do.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-30 14:23:45	I wish my hair was down to my butt again. I miss it.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-30 14:28:30	Guys hoodies &gt; girls hoodies
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-29 14:09:18	@ashiepooh1026 You're a fagass!
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-29 14:27:35	I am thirsty, but the coke machines are on the other side of the school. Fml
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-08-29 15:35:39	@ashiepooh1026 I got a Dr. Pepper. :)
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-05 14:01:00	I want oreos and butterfingers.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-06 14:14:16	@reIatabIe: DON'T TEXT ME WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING Im not trying to be the last unfinished message they find when your ass wrapped around a tree
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-04 13:18:00	You see, I give NO fucks today.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-03 03:42:35	I'M DONE WITH YOUR SHIT

75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-09 01:26:09	All she needs is recognition.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-09 01:27:43	Drinking your problems away is never the answer.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-09 01:27:57	But I don't take My own advice
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-09 01:28:02	Ever
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-09 03:00:35	Different girl every night at the hotel. @ChillChelseaa
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-09 04:30:15	I can't stop missing you
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-09 05:18:15	I am in misery. There ain't no body who can comfort me.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-10 23:18:34	Legalize illegal stuff. :)

75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-12 02:23:54	I can't decide if I hate wearing jeans or a bra more.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-12 02:31:56	Brought a whole pound of Mary, and I can't seem to find Molly.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-12 03:03:42	Jealously is cute.

75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-15 05:08:08	Coming out of my cage, and I've been doing just fine.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-15 05:08:59	Now I'm falling asleep while she's calling a cab, and he's having a smoke, and she's taking a drag.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-15 19:52:19	If you call me at all, don't tell me that I'm ordinary.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-15 19:38:26	If I were a potato, I'd be a baked potato.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-16 02:45:35	They say that love is forever. Your forever is all that I need.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-14 04:53:17	We'll do some drugs. We'll fall in love and get fucked up as the world just slows.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-16 08:25:36	Why in the actual fuck am I still awake?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-16 14:17:57	The lonely stoner frees his mind at night.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-16 14:26:24	@TMegann_Cross I was just reading that last night.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-17 18:30:00	Yeah, I'm not lady like. I'm not attractive. I'm not popular. But when was my purpose of life ever to please you?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-17 18:35:39	I do what I want. Don't like it, don't be my friend. Ya feel me?

75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-20 01:55:30	I'm sorry my singing gets on your nerves. I'm sorry that's the only thing that makes me happy when I'm down. I'm sorry you never understood.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-20 01:55:40	Wait. I'm not sorry.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-20 18:18:16	Talk shit to my face, not behind my back. #petty
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-20 18:25:27	You're just mad because I don't want you anymore.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-20 18:35:58	On a side note, my hair is soft today.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-20 20:56:26	I don't show emotions because emotions make you vulnerable.

75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-09-24 14:15:10	I broke it off thinking you'd be fine, but more I'm feeling sick looking at you cry. I want you back.

75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-14 18:24:17	It might hurt to lose people, but maybe they weren't supposed to stay.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-14 18:31:09	Why isn't there any cereal in this house? This should be considered a sin.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-14 18:44:18	We can make it just fine, and I'll stand by you.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-15 20:25:14	Life can get hard and things can go wrong, but you just gotta stand up and stay strong.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-15 20:28:20	@TeddyBearKillaa I'm so jealous of how cute you are.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-15 20:43:43	@TeddyBearKillaa Haha. I'm also a Mexican Obama.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-18 20:18:50	Can't wait to graduate and get out of this fake ass town.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-18 20:54:19	5 more minutes.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-17 14:58:20	Just be honest with me about anything and everything, and you will have my respect. Always.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-18 22:47:04	Can you just do one thing I ask?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-16 15:19:49	Why is Twitter so dead? C'mon now. This is my only entertainment at school.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-19 14:12:45	I'm hyper as fuck.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-19 18:03:50	I wasn't good enough because you got in the way.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-18 15:51:46	Bombed my personal finance test for sure.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-18 16:07:44	I HAVE TO PEE AND MY TEACHER WON'T LET ME GO. This school is corrupt.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-18 16:22:16	149 more days. :)
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-18 16:24:21	What kind of person makes you stay in class when you're about to piss yourself? An asshole.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-18 16:35:15	Fuck you. Fuck your class. Fuck your exam. I won't have to see you ever again. Whoo-fucking-hoo.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-22 01:21:45	#shoutout to @DallasGrantt ! Go follow him &amp; shit. :)
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-22 01:50:34	I'm. So. Hungry.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-22 01:57:27	American Horror Story. :)
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-22 01:57:46	@DallasGrantt I tried. :P
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-29 05:37:52	The Great and Powerful Oz. &lt;3
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-27 04:33:25	Some people are so ignorant that it is astounding they even have friends.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-27 05:32:04	When people actually cared &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-27 05:37:08	Whoa whoa whoa. Calm down.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-27 06:49:39	If you talk shit on Twitter instead of to someone's face, you're a pussy. Go home. (;
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-27 06:52:26	You're just jealous because someone else found what you gave up.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-27 06:52:49	So take a fucking seat, bitch.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-27 06:53:25	@TeddyBearKillaa "Why do you do this to me?" &lt;3 that song.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-27 07:04:53	People &lt;&lt;&lt;
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-27 07:05:08	I'm NOT a people person.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-27 07:08:28	The word "pussy" is only ever okay to say when I'm pissed.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-27 07:08:45	Okay. End of rant. Carry on.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-30 05:40:05	Me: Truth is I don't know you but that should change. (:
*9 months later*
Me: Truth is I should have never said that.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-30 06:47:41	Me? Get a life? Ha. You're the one that can say something on Twitter and not to my face. Sit the fuck down.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-30 10:01:11	I can see my breath in the car. This is not okay.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-27 18:27:15	Why haven't I given up already?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-27 18:33:49	Don't subtweet me. I saw that shit. No bueno.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-27 19:05:19	I want some Sonic.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-30 17:19:16	It's dark in a cold December, but I got you to keep me warm..
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2013-12-30 22:11:47	@Monotarium_EP Tha Joker. You know your stoner music. I'm proud.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-03 06:47:41	Those moments when the music gets you down...when usually it is your only savior.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-03 06:52:19	Got that young love even when we're old.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-03 06:55:58	I don't even remember why I'm wasting all these tears on you.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-07 03:25:45	You're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-07 04:52:27	I wish I could be perfect to you.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-09 13:57:26	Fuck school.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-09 15:27:54	I wanna be out of here
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-09 15:30:24	I will love you till the end.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-09 15:43:01	I don't get waves of missing you anymore. They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-10 19:58:40	Fuck Mrs. Manley's class. Ugh. I don't wanna go.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-13 18:23:56	123 days until we're out of here, guys.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-13 18:40:31	School bathrooms &lt;&lt;&lt;
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-14 18:59:14	Is love really worth the risk of falling?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-18 21:51:23	@ashiepooh1026 Is it bad that that made me hungry?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-21 18:24:55	How many days should I smile with a frown 'cause you're not around with the sun on your shoulders?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-21 18:25:30	And how many nights must I wake up alone and know in my soul that it's almost over now.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-21 18:41:59	She always wanted what she never had and never had what she needed so badly.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-21 19:32:29	I wanna go homeeee.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-21 19:37:21	18 in 8 days. I'm excited as fuck.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-22 19:00:25	Wcw sucks when you aren't pretty.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-22 01:11:12	I cuss too much on Twitter.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-01-22 19:38:56	I think CP is nap time.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-03 01:31:11	Don't take for granted those little things.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-03 01:38:34	All my sandcastles fall like the ashes of cigarettes and every wave drags me to sea.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-04 14:25:36	We'll take the world by storm. It isn't that hard.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-04 14:40:52	Magically I turn tragedies into melodies.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-04 14:41:31	You're such a dumb fuck. You need to shut up.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-05 14:59:48	I don't hate you, boy. I just want to save you while there's still something left to save.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-05 15:16:01	I hope it's something worth the waiting.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-05 15:16:12	Thunder storms could never stop me.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-05 16:26:23	It sounds like there is a dying whale in my stomach.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-05 18:57:09	C'mon, Danny. Let us out of school early. It is fucking cold.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-05 18:58:30	I wanna go home early and cuddle with my mexican.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-05 19:20:37	Danny Weeks. Why do you hate us?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-05 20:03:13	Writing demerits all CP. &lt;&lt;&lt;
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-05 15:00:45	I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer to the questions that you still have.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-05 15:30:59	I will always be yours, forever and more, through the push and the pull.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-05 15:32:14	@yourmomloves269 Yeah, it is!
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-05 15:39:21	I. Need. Fooooood.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-05 16:24:06	I want Hot Cheetos. So bad.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-06 20:04:06	I'm in a hurry to be gone away awhile.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-07 02:41:46	Hate when my friends are racist against Mexicans right in front of my face.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-07 02:42:07	My boyfriend is Mexican, asshole.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-07 02:42:27	So yes. I will get an attitude with you.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-07 19:02:08	After all this time, I'm still into you.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-07 15:51:41	I want some salt and vinegar chipsssss.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-07 15:51:55	I tweet about food too much.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-08 05:52:29	You got me on the outside looking in.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-08 06:48:42	You'll always find me right there again.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-08 07:18:38	People need to wake up and entertain me. I have no life.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-08 08:01:29	I tend to shut people out. I like my space.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-08 08:09:13	All of me loves all of you.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-08 08:09:47	You're my downfall. You're my muse. My worst distraction. My rhythm and blues.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-11 14:31:31	We are fragile. We are human.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-11 14:31:47	We break fast 'cause we are glass.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-12 19:56:19	Take me with you. I start to miss you. Take me home. I don't want to be alone tonight.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-12 19:57:09	I will run to you till I cant stand on my own anymore. I cross my heart and hope to die.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-12 19:58:36	I want a love that's crazy.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-12 20:00:49	If you need anything, just say the word. I mean anything.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-12 20:01:58	It's those pills that you don't need to take. Medicating beauty is such a mistake.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-13 19:55:47	Excited to go tanning after school with the bestie, @ashiepooh1026 :)
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-18 16:45:08	I think I have an obsession with hot cheetos
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-18 16:50:47	11:18. Hurry up.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-14 16:41:13	Hungry.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-15 22:11:43	You've only been dating for a few months. You aren't Mrs. (Insert boy's last name here). You just sound ignorant.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-02-26 01:08:14	I'm so done with lies
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-04 03:02:04	I'm at war with my demons.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-04 03:12:52	These eyes put up a fight but once again these tears always win. 🎧
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-05 21:43:55	I want to be boundless and infinite.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-07 16:14:27	At least she's trying.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-07 16:14:47	And maybe what he told her was all she ever needed to hear, anyhow.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-07 17:12:06	11:11 wishes never come true. Done wasting my breath.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-07 17:17:24	@imAnthonyB for sure.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-14 05:08:43	We're like fire &amp; gasoline. I'm no good for you, you're no good for me.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-14 07:37:42	Why tf am I still awake rn?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-13 04:23:55	All I want is to watch a movie and pass the fuck out while doing so. Is that so much to ask?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-11 19:18:07	I'm so high, but I ain't smoked yet. I'm just coming down from this. ❤️
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-13 13:59:13	I want to save you while there's still something left to save.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-14 22:56:42	50 First Dates. ☺️
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-15 07:15:12	My friends are assholes.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-15 07:39:49	Tired of being pushed around like I'm nothing. When all I ever do is try to help.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-15 07:40:04	Just gonna lock myself in the bathroom.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-15 07:40:15	This is such bullshit.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-12 05:29:43	Let's run around and act like kids again. So what if it's crazy? That's all that love is anyway.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-14 01:53:19	Fuck you right back.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-14 01:57:14	I've learned to live with your mistakes...
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-14 01:59:39	Making loveeee facessssss.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-14 02:04:17	Kiss your body from the tip top all the way down to your feet. 😘❤️
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-14 02:14:05	Good bye, my almost lover.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-14 02:14:37	I'm trying not to think about you. Can't you just leave me be?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-14 02:16:08	Shoulda known you'd bring me heartache. Almost lovers always do.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-12 18:39:06	A little advice. http://t.co/8k7x9FyRQs
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-12 18:48:13	What lol http://t.co/Y7oQTGBcHo
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-13 01:36:43	Don't fall in love. There's just too much to lose.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-13 04:22:25	My DVD player is a cunt.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-17 07:14:58	@TMegann_Cross I freaking miss you!
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-17 07:20:21	Thanks to Megan, everyone on my timeline is losing the game.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-17 07:50:36	I liiiiike biiiig butts and I cannot lie.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-17 07:52:57	Good kush and alcohol?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-17 08:07:13	Can we get some real bitches in Dickson? Forreal.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-17 08:10:11	That video actually made me scared to get up and go get something to drink. Is that bad?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-17 08:28:20	I'm going to bed. Good night.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-16 07:05:52	I just love when people make fun of me for my weight..
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-16 07:08:16	Insensitive assholes like that are why people end up committing suicide. Fucking prick.

75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-16 07:08:36	Just because you're more accomplished than me doesn't mean your opinion matters more.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-16 07:09:28	It just makes you a jackass for thinking you are any better than anyone else.

75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-20 01:33:31	I'm just gonna sit here and eat my feelings, okay? Okay.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-20 02:28:56	We've come too far to give up.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-20 02:32:18	I'm only human.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-20 02:44:15	It's better to be safe than sorry.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-20 02:44:18	Trust your instincts. If he ever makes you feel unsafe, don't make up excuses, just get up and leave. That's all there is to it.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2014-03-19 06:18:41	We got this three-way subtweeting shit going on.

75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-01-22 23:07:51	I'll just fly and hope that I remember the good times when it's done.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-01-23 02:24:45	If I can't keep you happy, why do you even waste your time on me...
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-01-23 02:32:34	Just feel like a waste of space sometimes tbh
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-01-23 17:24:25	I really want hash browns and bacon and biscuits and gray.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-01-23 17:24:41	I'm starving

75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-01-25 19:25:42	Maybe we found love right where we are.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-01-25 19:39:00	Baby, you seem too good to me.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-01-25 19:39:41	Boy, you've got just what I want. I'm not going a place without your heart.

75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-04-24 06:16:24	And I don't get waves of missing you anymore. They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes. Never getting dry, so I get high.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-04-24 05:06:33	I hate being yelled at...
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-04-24 05:12:56	You're just pushing me away tbh.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-04-25 03:56:58	I want to feel wanted.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-04-24 15:47:57	I never do anything right.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-04-27 00:03:49	If we got nothing, we got us.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-04-29 14:38:57	This last week of the semester is gonna kill me
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-04-29 14:39:58	@EdenBroom where are you living next semester?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-04-29 14:52:22	@EdenBroom I have no idea! Ashley and I don't want random ass roommates but two bedrooms are expensive as fuck
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-04-29 14:56:17	@EdenBroom dude for sure!!! Hit up Ashley and talk to her about it!
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-04-29 14:58:17	@EdenBroom who else were you planning on getting a house with?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-04-29 22:06:41	Just a boy and a girl gonna take on the world, and we wanna get caught in the middle of a very happy ending
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-04-30 02:19:26	You're what makes it better than better could ever be.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-05-03 22:35:03	@_Drizzleeehomie @marleenicoleee  both of you are so gorgeous omg
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-05-05 03:58:58	Give a little time to me. We'll burn this out. We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-05-06 12:13:37	See the sky, see the stars. All of this could be ours
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-05-07 04:47:48	When I'm upset, I kinda just like sitting in my bathroom getting stoned by myself
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-05-30 02:39:12	Last dance w Mary Jane. One more time to kill the pain
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-05-30 04:03:11	Now the rain is just washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-06-03 05:37:53	Up watching Friends because why not?
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-06-01 14:40:19	I hate how much I love you, boy. I can't stand how much I need you.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-06-05 10:49:36	Maybe relationships are just something I'll never be good at.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-06-13 08:59:48	Forget about me. It's what I deserve.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-06-15 02:57:13	Having money is great but I kinda miss having a life lol
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-06-15 07:55:59	That's when it hits him, that these god damn drugs won't fix him.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-06-15 08:06:56	I stopped caring bc he never did &amp; now I'm the bad guy.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-06-16 19:21:57	Everything is nothing without you.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-06-17 09:54:24	Just hold me in your heart and let the ocean take me
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-06-17 20:14:23	It wasn't about being happy or unhappy. I just didn't want to be me anymore.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-06-18 18:23:06	It's like one step forward and two steps back. No matter what I do, you're always mad
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-06-19 06:59:55	You know that I could use somebody, someone like you.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-06-19 07:09:30	I'll be better when I'm older.
75882051	alysanpaige0115	2015-06-19 07:20:00	Forever and always, through the good and the bad and the ugly.
