760173896	KloutSupport	2014-06-27 20:30:23	@Greg_Berdan Good idea!  I will forward this information along to our development team!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-06-27 20:43:58	@caitlinobauer Our team said this is likely due to an issue on flickr's end.  Keep in mind we do not calculate flickr into your klout score!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-06-27 20:49:43	@NancyRosePribyl we do not score wordpress activity, we only track the interactions for that social media site.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-06 20:38:49	@Kondylas It is a little strange, but for the most part your score changes appear normal.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-06 22:37:13	@OnneMomento101 Are you sure you logged into the same account on your app?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-07 00:22:16	@BizTrends Does this happen every month when LinkedIn updates for you?  Your klout account gets disconnected or just LinkedIn?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-07 00:23:23	@BizTrends LinkedIn only updates monthly due to LinkedIn's API settings.  It is not something we can control.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-07 00:29:54	@BizTrends It appears you post more on FB and have more interactions on FB compared to G+
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-07 00:33:08	@BizTrends please refer to your other tweet.  If you need more explanation about how score is calculated...http://t.co/SqYalUE44x

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-07 19:56:12	@ricardowec Yes and no, sometimes it can take up to two days for content to be updated.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-06 06:16:16	@raydennis Hi there, please email help@klout.com with a screenshot of the error and further details. Thanks!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-07 21:00:29	@ricardowec you should be thinking about what time you should post to get more interactions, not when your post will get updated the fastest
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-07 21:22:03	@KnatPix We are committed to measuring influence wherever it happens so we'll definitely take that into consideration.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-07 22:07:32	@CanuckPaesano You can just login to your klout account and view your score activity over the past 90 days under the measures tab!

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-08 17:26:35	@KentaroIchikawa Have you recently connected your Twitter?  It can take a couple days to properly update.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-08 17:27:20	@LisaLaviaRyan Your ticker will only update for articles shared under the overview tab, not the create tab.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-08 17:27:40	@ehCanadaTravel We do not support connecting G+ pages at this time.  We are hoping to add this feature soon.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-12 17:42:45	@DannaCruzan Please disconnect/reconnect and reauthorize all your social media accounts then wait a couple days to see if activity shows up.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-09 01:45:27	@ricardowec I apologize, I don't really understand.  All posts are scored the same regardless of what time they were posted...
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-11 16:29:19	@KentaroIchikawa It appears your twitter is now displaying properly, can you confirm this for me?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-11 16:57:04	@Kondylas Every time I have looked into your account I find your FB was reconnected within the past couple days.  This is likely the reason.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-11 17:24:45	@sportzcrazed I just looked into your account and it appears your tweets and foursquare checkings are being tracked correctly.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-11 17:25:38	@HQ101Worldwide We measure posts that include interactions, whether they be interactions from the public or just friends.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-11 17:37:34	@pavelrozevic Please try connecting via the mobile app.  This has worked for some users with this problem.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-11 17:39:02	@hoevisch What is your email address you are using?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-11 17:39:46	@_jameslane We appreciate your feedback.  We're currently not adding topics in a one-off manner but I'll make a note of your request.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-11 17:41:30	@AdolfoGatti Klout shouldn't only be picking up the last post of the day.  It should be picking up all posts with social interactions.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-11 17:42:52	@thenameispico Redeem what exactly?  Why are you showing me pictures of a dog?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-11 17:43:15	@thenameispico Only people with klout accounts will have a klout score.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-11 17:43:47	@raydennis Some of our users have experienced success by reauthorizing via the mobile app instead of a desktop.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-14 20:20:53	@TamaraGunter I can't give you an estimate on time right now.  We are working as quickly as we can to resolve this issue.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-14 20:21:13	@OnneMomento101 Hi there, please email help@klout.com with a screenshot of the error and further details. Thanks!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-14 20:28:51	@WalterAkana I apologize, but I don't really understand what your asking.  Do you think you could re-phrase?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-14 20:29:34	@farrukhnaeem We do our best to surface engaging content on your measure tab but not all scored content gets shown. We're always improving!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-12 00:20:38	@thenameispico If they are receiving perks through klout, then they must have a klout account.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-14 21:40:30	@deehallmendes Only tweets with interactions are registered.  Thus, my interaction with you.  Do your other tweets have interactions?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-14 18:44:01	@brandonhimpfen Some users have reported it fixed, please email help@klout.com with a screenshot of the error and further details. Thanks!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-13 17:26:21	@SubhamGhosh5 Some Perks can be a discount off that would require payment of your choice but most are free - thanks!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-15 18:04:59	@WalterAkana You are not limited at all.  You can post whatever you want, simply type your content in the text box.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-15 18:05:57	@_jameslane Yes the development team is fully aware of all topic requests we receive, do not worry.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-15 18:07:51	@Logan__Swartz The average klout score is 40
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-15 18:08:45	@antoinescookies We are aware of this issue and are working quickly to resolve it.  Thanks for your patience and understanding.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-15 18:09:49	@scarletforrest What blog service do you use?  Foursquare is the only blog service we score currently.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-15 18:10:08	@Suzeelove What would you like to know?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-15 18:11:07	@OmaKatrina It appears your Twitter is connected to a klout account already. https://t.co/FVAuKumpAM

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-18 17:09:16	@OmaKatrina We don't support connecting tweetcaster as a social media, only Twitter.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-18 17:12:58	@ruicmonteiro LinkedIn updates monthly, so once LinkedIn updates and gets calculated into your score.  Your score should be back to normal.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-18 17:31:30	@Suzeelove Yes, these posts should still be receiving engagements.  Therefore, they should factor in your klout score.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-18 18:31:59	@HsnHamad We are aware of this issue and are working quickly to resolve it.  Thanks for your patience and we appreciate your understanding.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-18 18:33:46	@WanderinPoet What exactly are you asking?  Yes, we score engagement on Twitter.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-18 18:34:18	@WanderinPoet We are aware of this issue and are working quickly to resolve it.  Thanks for your patience and your understanding.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-18 18:35:12	@3S1Incorporated We only allow users to connect G+ profiles.  Yes, G+ profiles do effect your score.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-18 18:36:12	@HaveSippy It appears there is already a klout account set up with your Twitter account.  https://t.co/UFK0HmjZhX
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-18 18:36:46	@HaveSippy Yes, I just responded to your other tweet.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-18 18:44:25	@jimmypalmieri It appears your G+ profile is not receiving any engagement... the following recommendations is a known issue.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-18 18:45:21	@RobMorrisonOff When you post content, do you make sure the Twitter icon located to the left of the share now button is highlighted?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-18 18:46:49	@oneikasyogalife This is a known issue.  Some users have experienced success by connecting via mobile app vs. desktop and vice-versa.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-18 20:24:54	@oneikasyogalife Good to hear!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-18 20:39:52	@WanderinPoet Twitter is in no way more heavily weighted than other social medias.  The klout score is an algorithm based on many factors.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-18 20:45:58	@timbcarlson Unfortunately, we do not offer support services over the phone at this time.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-19 23:00:07	@FartingDuck It appears your klout account https://t.co/K1FSJZ7UTr is only connected to Twitter.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 17:50:56	@TonyVidler The klout score is based on many factors in addition to volume of interactions: http://t.co/SqYalUE44x

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-21 08:25:38	@TonyVidler You will continue to see your score show these types of trends as we continue to analyze your data.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-21 20:53:29	@RONVERjoel Keep in mind we only measure interactions on Twitter (retweets/mentions)
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-21 17:03:34	@AlfredPoor The website is up and running again and I see your interactions from yesterday now registered.  Thanks for you patience.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-21 17:43:44	@Suzeelove As long as they receive social interactions, klout should register them.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-21 20:55:53	@jonmarkbaldwin was it responded to yet?  What's your email address?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-21 21:32:45	@EricMPastore We do not display moments for LinkedIn, we simply update your score based on LinkedIn interactions.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-21 21:42:43	@EricMPastore We only measure foursquare data.  However, keep in mind foursquare data contains interactions from both foursquare and swarm.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 20:21:40	@TonyVidler We take the past 90 days of data to generate your Klout score.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 20:22:12	@TonyVidler  As that 90-day window moves forward, some of your days with high engagement may not reflect right away on your profile.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 20:22:27	@TonyVidler Your Klout score will recover as we analyze new data.  Your Score from 30 days ago compared to today's score has decreased less
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 20:23:09	@TonyVidler than 0 points.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 20:23:33	@TonyVidler Your score is showing normal activity as you can see your score increase/decrease everyday depending on your
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 20:23:56	@TonyVidler engagement you receive with your networks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 20:23:56	@TonyVidler You will continue to see your score show these types of trends as we continue to analyze your data.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 20:24:11	@TonyVidler Please also note that the score is not just based on the pure amount of retweets/likes/etc. you receive.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 20:24:22	@TonyVidler We also take into account how influential the people you are interacting with.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 20:24:38	@TonyVidler If the CEO of Twitter retweets your content, this is worth a lot more compared to your average user.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 20:25:04	@TonyVidler Please keep in mind that the average score is 40. You can read more about how the score is calculated at http://t.co/dzn2YNxqF4.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 20:25:14	@TonyVidler Or please email help@klout.com if you have any further questions. Thanks!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 20:35:22	@jakejarvis Nope!  I'm aware of it, I've just been waiting on my development team to give me an appropriate answer so I can tell you!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-21 21:49:50	@IamTheyungKing It appears your posts are showing up fine.  Please allow a couple days for your recent posts to appear.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-21 22:04:32	@IamTheyungKing Ah yes I apologize.  We no longer count reactions for FB and Twitter, only Instagram.  You can still see the score impact.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 21:42:16	@TonyVidler As long as your score measures are updating properly, your score is correct.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-20 21:43:02	@TonyVidler You have a high enough klout score to the point where the volume of engagements don't matter so much.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-22 21:58:01	@arvindvarryan Keep in mind we only score retweets and mentions, not favorites.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-22 22:47:40	@Storix You can try having topics that would be more likely to find articles in English?  We currently have no language filter.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-25 15:35:49	@BH_Social what stream are you referring to?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-25 16:08:16	@MarketingCath You should delete one account and connect the social media of whatever account you deleted to your other account after.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-25 16:08:40	@MarketingCath no deleting will not effect your score.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-25 16:13:45	@jaysamit Why are your LinkedIn posts being counted?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-25 16:28:03	@jaysamit Keep in mind LinkedIn only updates once a month.  Please wait until early September to re-evaluate.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-25 18:57:10	@NiaMassage Have you clicked on the link?  Sex with Emily is simply the publisher's name and the article is about a massage candle.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-08-25 20:11:04	@NiaMassage I understand.  I'll notify the development team of these issues related to "massages" suggested content.  Thanks for the info!

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-03 22:57:57	@derekneuland We don't share our algorithm to determine how influential a user is.  But their Klout score should be an accurate guideline.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-03 17:35:14	@RichardRae We are committed to measuring influence wherever it happens so we'll definitely take that into consideration.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-03 17:46:56	@Willjedward90 We don't collect credit card information for any of our users!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-03 21:28:40	@IanMCalvert Hi Ian, this information is confidential and we do not share it with our users.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-03 21:30:50	@Bergg69 We ran into an error in our system earlier this morning with the Scores displaying properly but our team has since fixed the issue.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-03 21:31:36	@basoncia This is a known issue!  Some users have experienced success attempting to connect via mobile app vs. desktop and vice-versa.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-03 22:00:58	@dearanaaa Hi, do you have a question or concern you would like to share?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-03 22:01:44	@TamaraMcCleary to add topics search for them in the search bar above your list of topics.  To delete them click the edit button.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-03 22:28:53	@derekneuland It doesn't matter how many followers the user who retweets your tweet has, but rather how influential they are.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-03 22:29:26	@TamaraMcCleary look for you list of topics on the right side of your create page.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-04 21:22:43	@xsimplicity17 Hi there, we have informed VEEV to see what else we can do for you. Thanks!

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-04 21:53:24	@derekneuland No problem, that's my job!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-04 22:42:59	@awordreviews Hi there, please email help@klout.com with a screenshot of the error and further details. Thanks!

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-05 20:53:03	@IanMCalvert If you want your content to be more UK based, try adding topics more related to UK themes/activities?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-05 21:21:16	@IanMCalvert Well if that's the case there is nothing else I can suggest for you.  The majority of content online is U.S. based.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-05 21:24:08	@IanMCalvert We can't reveal the way we measure influence!  It's a secret!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-05 21:43:00	@IanMCalvert We do not offer a "country" based filter for our content currently.  We are looking to add this in the future.  Stay tuned!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-05 21:44:52	@keepersolutions what do you mean by rollover topics?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-05 23:02:22	@IanMCalvert The two events are not related.  And it appears you need to re-authorize your Twitter, this is likely why your score dropped.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-08 21:06:07	@axolROSE Make sure your settings are correct on http://t.co/gPdHGdtcWI &amp; edit your topics to your perference http://t.co/K2QAFGo5bi

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-09 17:56:21	@LisaLaviaRyan good news!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-09 18:00:06	@FrankeJessi okay please keep in mind we only register check-ins from the past 90 days and only check-ins with interactions on them.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-09 18:00:16	@FrankeJessi if you have any of these check-ins not showing up let me know.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-10 17:29:25	@BirkbeckNews We only support connected LinkedIn individual profiles, not pages.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-10 19:48:31	@CaribbeJan awesome, good news!  Thanks for getting back!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-08 17:22:10	@keepersolutions yes this page is not updated.  To add topics, search for them using the search bar above your list of topics.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-08 17:27:20	@IanMCalvert Perhaps because you are spamming Tweets to kloutsupport and mentioning the same person in those tweets?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-08 17:27:54	@IanMCalvert Please keep in mind spamming tweets is no way to increase your Klout score either.  It's not about the volume of interactions!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-09 21:18:27	@K8Tilton Hi there, which Perk are you trying to claim? Did you try by visiting http://t.co/EAs9noRAtf?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-09 21:33:31	@dijidok we do too :)
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-09 21:34:14	@Andi1028 Nope sorry, your Klout score is comprised of the past 90 days of social media interaction!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-09 21:35:06	@Brackeen4JP Please let me know if this problem continues for the next couple days.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-09 21:41:08	@saifulissohel Please keep in mind we only register RT's and mentions, not favorites.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-08 17:53:17	@IanMCalvert Why are you doing this?  Please just ask questions and nothing else.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-08 20:49:40	@axolROSE Hi there! Lots of factors go into being eligible for a Perk, not just score. Check out more info here http://t.co/r51s5A7Ffj

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-12 18:11:26	@sheconsulting Go into Klout acct and disconnect FB "personal" pg, once done, then you can connect your "business" page.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-12 21:47:42	@natemup There should be a settings app on your phone by default?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-09-15 15:51:45	@FrankeJessi Could you please provide me with an example of the check-in that hasn't shown properly?  A screenshot?

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-11 14:06:28	@CarlRamallo There are over 400 variables that factor in your score &amp; they change all the time. It is normal fluctuation.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-11 14:14:45	@88RaveJesus88 Log into Klout, click on settings, then Networks, then select Disconnect next to instagram. Then add back the correct account
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-10 16:59:57	@neemaam Sorry this is a known bug. We are working to fix it quickly. Some users have success connecting from a desktop/laptop. Try that?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-10 17:29:52	@ryanoemge It isn't a network that can be attached to Klout at this time. Maybe it will be sometime soon. Thank &amp; have a great weekend.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-10 19:33:23	@ryanoemge It isn't factored in through Linkedin's score. I have passed your suggestion on to the feedback team. Thank you.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-10 20:08:12	@shreyshtyle Are you still having the problem logging into the Klout app through twitter?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-10 20:51:21	@GoogleKrome Our apologies! Please try again by visiting http://t.co/XRDaTPxuHn  - thanks!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-14 14:51:25	@McOnieAgency Scores come from +1's &amp; comments. Not from posting. It's the social interactions it gets. Can take 14 days 2 register score
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-14 14:54:15	@VoIPPBX_systems Can you take a screen shot of what you see please? Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-14 17:05:52	@McOnieAgency Glad to help. Please let us know if you have additional questions.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-14 17:21:20	@affordablesmm Is it a 404 error code? If so, it's a known bug &amp; we are working to fix it. Try connecting from Desktop/laptop.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-14 20:34:32	@aziomedia There are over 400 variables that go into making up your Klout score. Your posts need to have social interactions too.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-14 22:06:31	@ZiggyVertigo great, enjoy!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-13 18:17:18	@SzebastianOnne We tested this &amp; weren't able 2 replicate the issue. It may be machine specific, could U test from another machine/network?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-13 19:52:00	@DeepakMavinkurv Did you receive that when you tried to share content or read content?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-13 19:55:09	@TranslationLady There R over 400 variables that go into  Klout scores. That kind of drop is considered normal based on social interactions
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-13 20:19:31	@shreyshtyle We are sorry you are having this issue. Our developers are aware and are working on the issues.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-15 14:21:09	@koulonis Sorry to say there are not lists per region for brands. They would need to be compared manually.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-16 00:01:42	@TheExecutiveSEO We see this account for you: https://t.co/GX275v25U5 is there something else you need? We aren't clear on "send my shares"
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-16 01:31:50	@glopilot So the tech team seems to think that you should now be able to login using twitter. Please give it a try and let us know.Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-16 01:34:37	@dadofdivas Can you register for a new account w/ Twitter, then reassociate all your networks w/ new account. U will need a new email though
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-16 01:35:09	@dadofdivas Please let us know if this works for you. Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-16 02:00:22	@affordablesmm We were unable to duplicate the error on our end. Maybe try and clear your cache, cookies &amp; browsing history.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-17 18:22:37	@glopilot We looked your acct &amp; everything looks perfect. Can you clear Cache etc &amp; try again. Log in w/ twitter only. Let us know. Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-18 16:02:21	@terilg Please email contact@klout.com. Thank you.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-18 16:12:13	@dadofdivas heard from tech team. We need to delete your account. Then you can create a new one. Pls advise if you'd like us to delete it.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-18 16:13:06	@dadofdivas please let us know if you have questions. Created your new account with your twitter then attach your other networks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-18 16:15:09	@outsidefound Still working on it. Do you have your networks set to auto post to each other. FB to Instagram &amp; or vice versa?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-17 20:06:38	@glopilot Yay. This is great. Let us know if there are any more issues we are happy to help. Have a great weekend.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-16 14:29:44	@deaf258 your score will drop if you have had a lot of social interactions on FB. We are always working on adding new networks, maybe soon.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-16 14:44:55	@SzebastianOnne Sorry that information isn't available to us.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-16 14:46:30	@trmyhre Everything seems to be working now....is it still down for you?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-16 16:03:36	@trmyhre Glad to hear. Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-16 16:18:53	@glopilot Looks like the only option is for us to delete your acct &amp; have you start over. You should be able to use the email of your choice
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-16 16:23:43	@glopilot then connect all your networks. If you can't use the orig email do you have another one you could use to set up a new account?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-16 16:30:45	@glopilot It should remove everything. We will delete it now &amp; then U need to wait 72 hrs to rebuild. It needs to get pushed from the system
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-16 16:31:05	@glopilot Does that plan sound okay to you?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-16 16:43:41	@glopilot It's officially been deleted. Maybe wait till Monday. PLEASE let us know if there are still issues once you start again. Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-16 18:15:59	@glopilot Thanks for being so patient. This was certainly an odd situation for us all to try and figure out.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-21 18:16:57	@S_Fleischer There isn't a function that gives that information. You can look them up individually. Good suggestion for us though. Thanks
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-21 03:29:07	@MahsauDaee Be sure to check your settings and make sure your email settings are correct - thanks! :)
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-21 19:51:47	@S_Fleischer You would need to enter their name or twitter handle in the search box of Klout.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-21 19:52:54	@ZiggyVertigo Excellent. Thanks for letting us know.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-21 21:24:02	@ExactlyThat Just want to be sure you were able to log in? If not, let us know so we can help. Thanks.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-22 00:53:46	@S_Fleischer You need to have their Klout page name or their twitter handle. Sorry there isn't an easier way.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-20 17:20:14	@deaf258 Thanks for the feedback. Our development team is always looking at new &amp; different networks to add to Klout. Maybe Ello will be too
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-20 17:22:47	@ReachScale We are sorry. There have been difficulties w/ the scheduler &amp; are working to fix it. Thanks for your patience &amp; understanding
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-20 17:24:27	@outsidefound Thank you for the information it will help us continue to understand why this is happening. We will keep you posted. Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-20 17:44:41	@laurenwadey25 Is this your klout accout? http://t.co/KMwsB3cCau we have it connected to this: http://t.co/5h3Yn6WZlg
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-20 17:49:26	@post_eclipse What is the email associated with your Klout account? Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-20 17:56:20	@dadofdivas Did you delete your Klout acct &amp; create a new one using twitter? If not let us know &amp; we will delete the acct for you. Thanks
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-20 18:01:18	@cc70458 Thanks for you feedback. There might be something in your "Topics" selections that is the cause of the recommendations you receive.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-20 18:14:31	@dadofdivas Just deleted. Create new acct w/ twitter. Once it's created you can add all your networks. Be sure to not disconnect twitter.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-20 18:15:02	@dadofdivas Once it's done let me know &amp; I'll check to be sure all connections are valid.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-20 18:20:09	@cc70458 We are so sorry. Just wanted to be sure it wasn't a result of settings as some users don't know to look there.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-20 18:21:07	@cc70458 We are sharing your thoughts on better content &amp; content suggestions to our development team. Thanks for telling us!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-20 18:47:45	@dadofdivas No you won't. It can take a few days for the score to fully calculate. Yay everything is connected &amp; valid.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-20 19:04:05	@tramaine_ray Here is a link that might help you understand what kinds of things it's calculating: http://t.co/Wii8h5scJC
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-20 19:06:22	@GuyClapperton You can connect a linkedin personal page &amp; business pages are on a list to look into adding in the future. Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-20 19:08:25	@MogiMarketing This might help: http://t.co/PTWZcEyjmg
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-23 14:46:16	@MiklosG Klout allows content to be created &amp; posted directly to Twitter &amp; FB personal profiles only. Let us know if you have more questions
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-23 14:50:25	@ParimSoftware Glad you're loving it. Sorry, but content can't be filtered by geographic locations. A great idea &amp; we'll use it as feedback!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-23 15:48:20	@shopladylike We received your email today about this problem &amp; are happy to help. It's easier to handle this through email. Is that okay?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-21 15:29:22	@tramaine_ray 58 to 51 is a big drop so we looked at your measurements graph &amp; aren't able to see 58. From Jul 23-Oct 20 the high is 51.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-23 17:41:00	@rasilla Hi there, please email us at help@klout and we will look into it for you. Thanks!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-21 17:11:53	@outsidefound We think the problem is resolved, we don't see new posts that say "Alyssa Pelletier has interacted w/ you. Please let us know

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-27 17:32:42	@danandmoore When reconnecting a network it can take up to 7 days for the score to recalculate. Also Linkedin only updates every 30 days.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-27 17:44:47	@VincentWright Hi, We wanted to let you know that we have responded to your email. Hope your day goes well.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-27 19:48:23	@konectakomercio Klout doesn't make you have a password. You need to go to http://t.co/Hk1iZSmZNN &amp; sign in with your twitter account.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-28 16:40:14	@hiddenla 10 is the initial score when signing up until all networks fully calculate, thus the jump to 70. Score movement is normal. Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-28 16:42:43	@MTNGreenwolfe Sorry that your score didn't show up for you. Your current score is a 33! Any questions please let us know. Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-28 16:44:32	@DrStoopit You need to go to your settings/networks/then disconnect your Instagram then reconnect the one you'd like to use. Does that help?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-28 16:46:57	@Karlbernier That is a great question. We will pass it onto the development team as a suggestion and something to consider! Thank you.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-28 17:48:25	@ParimSoftware Currently there isn't a filter by geo location. Try changing your topics to see if that helps. Any questions let us know.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-29 18:18:18	@ELRobota Most of your twitter score comes from the social interactions your tweets get. Your posts being retweeted &amp; you being @mentioned.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-29 19:30:31	@ELRobota Others favoriting your tweets aren't part of scoring. It's continuing to building how much others interact w/ your content. Thanks

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-30 18:44:37	@Dracaenawines 1st thing to try is to disconnect G+ then reconnect it. If it doesn't change it then we will continue from there. Thanks
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-30 22:17:21	@PeterRoche Thank you for that information. We are looking into this to determine why it happens.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-30 22:42:28	@PeterRoche Would you test something? Can you please share some content to twitter using klout? Then let us know what happens? Screen shot?

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-30 23:01:57	@PeterRoche "Edit your settings" link to reauthorize the klout posting app.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-30 20:01:12	@PeterRoche Would you be able to attach a screen shot of the error message for us? Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-30 22:10:08	@The_ChrisBryant This is a known bug. Users have had success connecting it from a desktop/laptop. Sorry for the inconvenience.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-30 23:23:00	@PeterRoche You tried to post content from Klout to twitter &amp; got the same error message or tried to follow a suggested twitter acct?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-31 15:43:22	@The_ChrisBryant Glad it worked and thanks for letting us know. Have a great weekend.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-31 15:45:54	@PeterRoche Would you test something? Can you please share some content to twitter using klout then......

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-31 18:17:49	@Gianmario_Deriu First try disconnecting twitter from your Klout acct &amp; then reconnect. If no change after 48 hrs let us know! Thanks
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-31 20:11:08	@PeterRoche Thank you. We will continue to look into this.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-10-31 20:14:30	@Splabman If by register you mean that is part of your score that's because Wordpress isn't currently a network that is scored.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-03 22:18:31	@PeterRoche This isn't related to a Twitter follow cap, it is related to our site. We're working on fixing it. Thanks for your understanding
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-03 22:20:58	@Dracaenawines Is your Dracaenawines acct a business G+ page? If so Klout allows only personal G+ pages to be connected. Does that help?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-03 22:27:31	@pagebypagepr May I have your email address assoc w/ your acct? What error message did you receive? You can email us at contact@klout.com
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-03 16:30:08	@dapperhouse Can you tell us if you have a Wordpress blog or not? Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-03 16:40:02	@TheNicholasSnow Would you mind emailing me at contact@klout.com. This would be easier to correct  that way. Thanks.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-03 17:03:39	@djwnl The email address where you received the notification... it should be the Klout acct associated w/ that email. Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-03 17:05:43	@dapperhouse You are welcome. Have a great week.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-03 20:32:58	@BeniciaBERT At this time we don't have that as a feature. It's great feedback though &amp; we'll pass it along. Thanks.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-06 01:26:45	@AZArdie We looked at your acct &amp; your networks are connected. We aren't sure how they would disconnect as you are the one to do that. Sorry
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-06 01:29:38	@dz45tr You can't actually remove a site from create tab. Those are a result of your topic settings. Maybe you can adjust something there?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-06 01:33:21	@saysashank After connecting it to Klout it can take up to 72 hrs for scoring info to display. Looks like connection was the 4th. Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-06 01:36:36	@nthnu It's shows all your social interactions, including @mentions, because it's all part of the scoring process. Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-07 23:15:26	@HPatrikCoyne Your twitter connection is invalid. Can you disconnect it &amp; then reconnect it?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-07 17:54:59	@LuckyCharr It looks like your score is back to normal now. It includes Oct 22nd. Please let us know if you have other questions. Thanks.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-06 19:47:39	@happypinkbunnie We are still working in the fix. Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks for understanding.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-06 19:49:04	@dz45tr Yes the voting down will absolutely help. Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-06 19:53:04	@kincsescsaba Your network of choice can only be connected to 1 Klout account. Any questions please let us know. Thanks

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-06 22:42:48	@outsidefound Also, can you send a screen shot of the twitter piece? Thanks
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-06 23:43:14	@kincsescsaba We looked at the accts &amp; see it connected to this acct: talent@hurefin.com if you see it on both please send a screen shot.

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-10 02:28:19	@Kvajepanden We can only surface the data that comes to us from the scored networks through their API. Sorry for the inconvenience.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-10 02:29:30	@rebeccaaguthrie Currently you can only post though Klout to a Facebook personal profile or twitter acct. Sorry for the inconvenience.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-10 02:32:18	@afashiongirlbe Sorry for the inconvenience and that this is happening but it appears that it is a problem with twitter.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-10 21:05:46	@etienneln Thanks for the feedback about opening new offices. We will pass that on to the development team.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-10 21:13:29	@VoluptuouslyRch Scoring updates daily &amp; is based on a rolling 90 day window of content. More social interactions gets you a higher score TY
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-10 21:14:57	@MarkPlant Thanks so much for bringing this to our attention. We will look into right aways. Thanks again.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-10 21:19:45	@JulietPurcell 1st thing is try disconnecting it &amp; then reconnecting it. Let us know when you have done that &amp; we can check the connection
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-10 21:27:51	@Kvajepanden We try &amp; surface all content from the API that the scored networks send us, as long as they have social interactions
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-10 21:31:25	@JulietPurcell Perfect. Your connection is valid. Now lets check it tomorrow to see if that worked (system updates over night).
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-10 21:40:49	@Sethmiesters We show this connected: http://t.co/puDxPr2J1Q Have to deleted the inactive Linkedin acct?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-10 19:33:29	@HomeAloneInD Log into Klout, go to settings, then networks, there disconnect FB personal, &amp; then connect FB page.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-11 15:57:51	@Kvajepanden Yes it counts. It's up to the scoring networks API to send it us. If their system didn't send it we can't score it. So sorry.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-11 15:59:02	@Dracaenawines At this time the only business accts that can attach to Klout is a Facebook page. Sorry for the inconvenience.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-11 20:02:30	@BestGayTravel Please email help@klout.com with the Perk names you are missing and we will look into it for you. Thanks!
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-11 22:12:10	@JKlisewilliams Create great content that gets a lot of social interactions. Good luck
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-12 20:17:46	@Kvajepanden Just wanted to let you know we are looking into this further. I will keep you posted. So sorry about this.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-12 23:05:26	@vmcampos Thanks for letting us know. :)  Are you still having trouble connecting?
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-14 19:23:11	@djrustyg Can you disconnect it and then reconnect the correct account? Thanks
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-14 19:26:34	@Life913 Score fluctuation is normal, it's based on a rolling 90 day window. So daily content older then 90 days no longer adds to scores.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-14 19:27:42	@C_H_Museum Would you please send us a screen shot of the reauth FB page you see? Thanks.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-14 19:57:34	@diduwidu Hi there, You should send an email to press@klout.com. They will be able to assist you there. Thanks &amp; have a great weekend.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-13 14:53:11	@LaughsLongest Thanks for sharing your feedback. We're always working on adding networks to improve user experience. No set date though. TY
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-12 16:40:13	@craigdeakin It's about your content having social interactions. More of that helps in a higher score. If you connect it, you need to use it
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-12 16:48:33	@craigdeakin It doesn't give you negative points. But no sense in connecting it if you don't use it.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-12 16:56:57	@GlutenFreeDee Yes, once you click on "share" under the photo is an "upload photo" button. Please let me know if you have questions. Thanks

760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-18 21:31:44	@Sethmiesters It has been disconnected. Only you can connect the correct one. Be sure you are signed into the correct account.
760173896	KloutSupport	2014-11-18 21:39:55	@laughinpescador Your posts need social interactions, Likes &amp; comments but not on profile pics. When that happens they will appear on Klout
