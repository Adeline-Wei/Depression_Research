763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-08-28 14:49:23	@PNauticExpress true, true. I suppose it really is just the ego that wishes to claim things
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-08-28 14:51:16	@Trancewave21 @twitter that could be very helpful

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-08-27 03:47:30	Most will invest their hearts in things that truly do not deserve their attentions; and pay no attention to the things they should.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-08-27 03:48:04	Work on yourself, become who you were meant to be, and never take any bullshit.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-08-29 16:15:01	Not doing drugs is like owning a mansion but never going inside, sure there's a slim chance you'll trip and kill yourself in the doorway
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-08-29 16:18:03	But come on, so long as you occasionally look at your feet you'll be fine. Just like with drugs, not doing them just limits your experience.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-08-29 16:20:59	And seeing as next to no one is able to endogenously induce neurotransmitters to release, inducing "drug" effects in their own mind
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-08-29 16:22:37	It makes a little more sense to try some things that nature has provided us, to determine if you want to figure out how to naturally induce
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-08-29 16:25:41	Said states, (although opiates, meth, and coke have downsides that truly outweigh the recreational value) stick to things with a low LD50
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-08-29 16:27:05	If a drug (meth for example) can destroy the factories where neurotransmitters are created in the brain it's best to just to avoid them
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-08-29 16:42:08	Oddly enough reading this has (Hallucinations by Oliver Sacks) described what I've just said in a better fashion http://t.co/BBwvOij5gy

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-03 05:01:05	"DON'T LET ME SEE YOU CRYING"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-02 19:39:14	So I have drawing for six hours everyday this week, so I'm a happy fucker
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-02 20:09:31	A place I never felt welcomed, 
Filled with lies and broken ties. 
Loneliness strikes me in company,
And yet I find solace alone.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-02 20:43:40	@BlueStateVa @alexgreycosm @joerogan @duncantrussell  guess I'll have to give that one another listen, it'll be a window into the past
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-02 22:34:39	Conquer your fears my dears
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-03 12:13:18	Art should be fun, I didn't fully sleep off that 26 of tequila
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-03 18:29:17	Strange chills fill me,
How can all this hate still be?
Will most ever learn to see we are all parts of the singular we.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-03 18:33:58	@firelag13  there's no such thing as normal, it's a false fabrication that everyone claims not to be, it's relative to your perception
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-03 18:59:04	@firelag13  exactly my friend
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-04 00:27:18	"Laugh at the beautiful"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-04 00:37:01	My "homework" for next week, find three black objects, guys I'm pulling my hair out. HOW WILL I EVER MAKE IT!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-04 00:37:33	I'M IN LOVE WITH LIFE!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-04 03:36:01	SHE LIVES BY THE LAW THAT SHE HERSELF HAS SET!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-03 04:46:45	Here's a drunk selfie for you beautiful fucks http://t.co/WnCcS70O8u
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-03 04:47:42	'WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-03 04:50:10	LOOKING MY WAY,
YOU KNOW JUST WHERE I STAY!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-04 05:58:25	"YOU'RE NO LONGER LAUGHING AND I'M NOT DROWNING FAST ENOUGH!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-04 05:59:23	You have to love seven day benders, sleep at 4 wake up for 7
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-04 06:02:21	I'll k breathe fire while you seek to fulfill that strange desire, the mire will seek to sire a new breed and our lives will know the dire.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-04 06:05:01	Damn you lone "k"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-04 12:36:20	Die with the season, create yourself into something new as the world does. 
Change those thoughts, enact fractal pattern of nature.
See anew
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-04 19:04:37	"I THINK I'VE THOUGHT MYSELF TO DEATH!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-04 00:52:48	A man with two hands
Legs to stand 
A life of demand 
Surrounded by those with minds of sand

Alas, will they ever come to understand?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-04 22:07:06	"LET GO OF THE ONES YOU ADMIRE! 
It's not like I was furious or boastful, my arms waving I'm saying goodbye."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-04 22:15:57	I've seen the way I once saw
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-07 01:41:45	This world exists in a realm of time so consciousness can feel physical experiences in multiple ways. We are all one. Oneness wished for us.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 15:02:19	@BlueStateVa  I'm cleansing my soul after this for a few days before I jump into hyperspace
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 15:11:27	"I'LL REFORM TO WHAT I WAS, AND COME BACK HOME AGAIN!"
Something I'm unsure I'll ever say
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 00:41:58	I've seen more than my share of terrors, some would have given up by this point. This moment is unique, nothing will ever be "this" again.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 00:42:57	although there is also the possibility that life is constantly repeating, we've seen these things before, and will again.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 00:44:41	We are the only ones who should make ourselves into who we're meant to be, don't burden others with your troubles as they've got their own.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 00:46:43	@DBolelli  FUCKING RIGHT!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 00:50:57	Read nearly half my textbook for art history and I've only had one class so far..
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 01:13:02	Lady Tequila, you're the only women I need
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 01:13:36	(don't worry people I'm just going on a ten day bender, next week is focused)
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 01:15:59	When I'm tired/hungover I tend to create much better pieces, I think it's because my mind isn't racing through hundreds of ideas a minute.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 01:22:26	Teach yourself, others can only inspire ideas. Knowledge comes from self pursuit of GNOSIS!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 02:31:47	I confused many with "this is the end"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-07 03:19:02	Let go of the attachment of thinking you know what is in the future
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-07 03:32:59	The artist is always captivated by two egos, the view we should die and the view of happiness. There is no in between and I am not alone.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 16:51:32	Make a home of anywhere you go. This world has beauty everywhere if you know how to look for it.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 19:37:48	Watching the sun's rise
Allowing it's warmth to touch my eyes 
Knowing their lies 
Expanding the mind
Unknown places
Perceptions yet to see
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 19:38:00	WAKE UP!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 19:42:34	"Damn Powerful Tryptamine"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-07 11:18:27	Whoever decided "let's mow the entire grounds at 7am on the first Sunday of the school year" is truly an asshole
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 16:02:25	@cosmologicka that's beautiful
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 16:07:52	@BenjaminSaulWar when I finally gave it a look I thought of Ralph Steadman
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 16:10:09	@cosmologicka  that it does, a strong soul can always come back from those experiences eventually. It can happen to anyone
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-07 14:56:31	Found a baby raccoon in my dream last night, now all I want in life is a baby raccoon.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-07 15:55:04	I'm always amazed at those that quote interesting things and yet have nothing interesting or original to say.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 20:37:00	@cosmologicka "THE APPLES OF THE VALLEY HOLD THE SEEDS OF HAPPINESS!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 16:13:45	All of our experiences are branches on the same tree.
That tree is life, it's ever growing and ever changing. 
(Alan Watts inspired thought)
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 16:14:55	Don't succumb to fear, sadness or hopelessness as they as well as all emotions are temporary 
"Calm will find your soul"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 16:16:21	@cosmologicka  I'll second that, losing control can make you appreciate it all the more once it's returned
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 16:21:57	How can you miss something that was never allowed to begin?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 16:25:53	@PNauticExpress  THE WORLD'S STILL SPINNING, THE PLANETS ARE ALIGNING AND THE SUN HASN'T EXPLODED. Many reasons to smile today!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 17:14:36	"A SUDDEN NOTE OF MUSIC WAS ISSUED FROM THE ARC, THE PRELUDE OF MUSIC!"

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-07 17:45:00	CAST OUT OF PARADISE BECAUSE OF KNOWLEDGE? 
AN IGNORANT PARADISE IS A FOREST WITHOUT TREES!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 22:36:11	@PNauticExpress #FibonacciFriday had to put something together for today http://t.co/1xRrJ9yR9i
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 23:01:20	@PNauticExpress  why thank you
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 23:05:20	So my hungover mind did this without looking at the page or taking the pen off once http://t.co/sVzlAQJZvy
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-05 23:27:52	@PNauticExpress well anything for a fellow psychonaut ;)
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 17:36:32	We are literally the physical embodiment of consciousness, the stars wished to see a new and over millions of years they've become you.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 17:37:01	(damn fingers, anew*)
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 17:40:59	@emmaseppala @jhalifax  some of the least compassionate things I've ever witnessed were women's actions to other women.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 17:43:28	Don't make absolute claims for relative values
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 01:01:06	@cosmologicka got me in a zeppelin mood
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 19:01:58	So I drank a few sips of tequila last night http://t.co/4qvxJzMf6c
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 19:04:06	I assumed I drank a lot but nowhere near 3/4 of a 26
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 19:06:50	@resetmenews @AmberLyon and as you've taught me it's deemed "getting well" as it very well should be
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 20:24:54	"I HAVE BECOME COMFORTABLY NUMB!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 03:06:21	Soon your kin will show you where you've been, 
The life you've been living in is an existence within. 
I laugh at the sights Seen.
Ha ha.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 20:38:45	"I DON'T WANT WHAT YOU WANT, I DON'T FEEL WHAT YOU FEEL! SEE I'M STUCK IN A CITY BUT I BELONG IN A FIELD!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 20:40:08	Time by Pink Floyd is the greatest alarm clock

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 20:50:17	The many faces I drunkenly drew last night http://t.co/6rYf1uSDyq
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-06 20:56:50	I'LL BE FAMOUS WHEN I'M DEAD,
SOMETHING MANY HAVE SAID!
I'LL BURN MY SOUL AND LOSE CONTROL, 
DEATH COMES TO SOON FOR THOSE WHO CROON!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 21:04:20	@ChrisRyanPhD very excited to give this one a good triple listen
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 21:46:10	@cosmologicka "what a long strange trip it's been"
Beautiful album
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 21:48:35	@cosmologicka  I will one day have the pleasure of doing so, so long as I can still find a copy when I've got the funds. Starving artist rn
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 21:56:43	"I DON'T NEED YOU LIKE I USED TO!" 
"WHEN YOU SLEEP YOU SLEEP ALONE..."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 22:04:29	@Stellagirl72  how is this conceived?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 22:07:22	@Stellagirl72  how was this formed, created, or devised, is this randomly chosen out of a hat or is there a system you've created?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 23:41:25	Sunsets you so beautiful http://t.co/6xKnqasBPU
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 23:57:46	@DailyDoober I know the feeling, not necessarily bad, in humanity's hives
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-09 00:03:27	My main goal in life is to simply survive the age of 27, that battle has taken many and I hope I can win.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-09 00:33:43	I'VE STOOD ON THE MOUNTAINS OF SPAIN, 
AND LOVED IN VAIN.
MANY TIMES, NEARLY GONE INSANE,
AND FELT OH SO MUCH PAIN.
NOW THE WORLD'S TO GAIN!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-09 00:36:14	I finally feel sane.
Only the remnants remain. 
I wish to see the world by train, 
Or gain new life from within this brain.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 01:18:14	SCULPTED UP A FEW TINY MUSHROOMS, SOON THEY SHALL BE PAINTED TRIPPY COLORS
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 01:29:35	THEY ARE DRYING http://t.co/9DWOaxoLqM
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-09 00:53:49	@PeyoteCoyotea  mesmerized for a moment by this one, great work
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-09 00:59:26	@PeyoteCoyotea recognition for a good piece should always be given when deserved
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-09 01:19:47	I don't understand how I couldn't stand sadness up until this point, now I comprehend it's beauty as a reminder of happiness past or to come
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 02:07:45	The wall is coming along http://t.co/UuDVpezikI
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 02:35:13	I survived my 2014 ten day bender http://t.co/NQHNJjIqh7
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 03:32:45	@clairecarson2  I think that's me
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 03:46:22	@clairecarson2  you don't know me well enough then ;)
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 03:53:17	@clairecarson2  maybe one day little miss
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 11:03:42	Great hour of sleep.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 16:16:11	@BlueStateVa  don't forget Crowley ;)
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 16:43:51	@BlueStateVa no but love is always appreciated in this unkind land
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-09 12:39:31	FUCK YOU ALARM CLOCK YOU DIDN'T GO OFF WHEN I NEEDED YOU TO!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-10 21:48:32	@AtlantisTheory just read @Graham__Hancock 's "Fingerprints of the Gods" 
He's already touched on most of what you're claiming.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-09 22:01:23	This world was ours, 
They've stolen it from us. 
To build towers that will burn and rust.
Their world was meant for dust,
Ours the living.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-09 22:03:00	@BlueStateVa @PrincesssRayne  and it's sad when you realize most will spend their lives entirely within said mindset
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-09 23:10:19	TEQUILA TUESDAY!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-09 23:13:14	LET US TAKE BACK THE NIGHT
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-10 22:05:24	@AtlantisTheory how will yours differ from Hancock's work? If it isn't synonymous info I'll gladly read your work
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-10 22:16:32	@AtlantisTheory when it's released I'll gladly purchase it and give it a read
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-11 00:02:03	Mind adrift at sea 
Somethings never meant to be
Change the way you see
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-11 01:11:34	@BenjaminSaulWar  the first rule of fight club...
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-11 01:13:45	@walkingwithlucy  fucking right! BHN
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-10 02:16:34	@PrincesssRayne @BlueStateVa  my wish is for people to realize the childish nature of their egos, and raise them separately from themselves
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-10 02:35:32	@PrincesssRayne wisdom is known without needing to be mentioned, that was an idea. Ideas need to be spread they're contagious, thoughts burn
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 19:53:56	@firelag13 or to allow for the small few to ignore nonexistent morals and see a truth that would horrify most
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 20:12:00	@PsychedelicLozo gladly my disembodied voice of a friend
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 20:15:41	I know it's been a good day when my hands look like this http://t.co/2GzRpIljQS
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-08 20:19:46	@camliardi LETS START A REVOLUTION! (not today though, I'm tired right now)
*our society's mindset most of the time*
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-11 12:44:00	"I AM HE AS YOU ARE HE AS YOU ARE ME, AND WE ARE ALL TOGETHER!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-10 10:38:08	My world is spinning in more ways than one.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-11 16:21:23	I can bring you to the visionary show.

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-11 22:19:53	"How did we get to be so far away from the things we love?"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-10 17:58:28	@BlueStateVa @PrincesssRayne it seems more and more are beginning to awaken, the beauty of reality is becoming hard to ignore
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-12 04:12:11	They're coming along nicely I'd say. http://t.co/LdzEh3wcAA
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-12 04:26:18	@notcourtney96 soon they'll be even crazier (got to let the paint dry)
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-12 12:16:16	"YOU SOUND SO ANGRY, JUST CALM DOWN, YOU FOUND ME..."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-12 12:18:37	"OH LORD, YES I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-12 12:19:52	@PNauticExpress this will be laden with spirals by the end of today #FibonacciFriday http://t.co/hocuWwL3GK
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-12 12:20:29	"MEET ME IN THE BATHROOM" 
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-12 12:21:56	"NEVER WAS ON TIME, YES I ONCE WAS FINE, BUT THAT WAS LONG AGO AND DARLING I DON'T MIND"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-12 14:10:15	@SarahhReidd  that's the way to do it ;)
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-12 19:27:34	You may think you see evil, but in truth you're just blind to the oneness of all.
We're just consciousness getting to know itself, relax.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-13 21:06:10	Our songs will not go unsung.
These battles we rage within and without cannot go unwon. 
The work in the mind is never quite done.
Have fun.

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-13 22:54:58	So I finished two books today just for the fuck of it, seven hours well spent.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-13 00:35:47	@PNauticExpress there are actually some of them spirals in this wee one

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-14 20:57:12	@PNauticExpress @duncantrussell  not even solely shrooms, most psychedelics would probably result in this form of mental healing
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-14 20:58:00	@nicoleebarr it adds more zest that way
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-15 00:31:17	@indigo_truther  "they asked us what we wanted to be, and then told us what not to be."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-15 00:38:01	@PNauticExpress @duncantrussell  I know Leary discussed this, abstaining from smoking during the experience will be of great aid to quitting
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-15 04:16:33	@HeatherBrouwer3 @mambcity  this is somewhat frightening
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-15 05:05:49	I feel like I'm 64, 
Most things in life I don't want anymore. 
Entranced by mythical lore, 
Come meet me one day at the shore.

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-13 02:57:16	@mambcity @clairecarson2 I FUCKING MISS BOTH OF YOU BEAUTIES
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-13 10:26:04	Awake in the hours of sleep, 
Thoughts that crumble and creep.
I see into that dark deep,
Most will remain as sheep, the wolves are hungry.

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-14 07:47:39	Tell me a story
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-15 21:46:14	I can't stand it when people assume that an artistic talent was just magically given to you, it takes work and focus just like any skill.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-15 21:48:19	There are very few people that can immediately sing a perfect tune, draw something they see, or paint a tree. Stop devaluing their hard work
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-15 21:52:31	The assumption that something comes naturally without any hard work is somewhat hilarious to me.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-15 22:02:24	@trutherbot  and then after attempting to create a method of deriving energy directly from atoms was cast out by capitalist society
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-15 22:44:58	We're out of time to say "I'll do that tomorrow" 
Our world is getting to a point where there may not be a tomorrow for all of us.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-15 22:45:23	This must change, and only we can enact this change. 
WAKE UP!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-15 22:46:02	@DailyDoober  definitely the latter

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-14 14:39:50	I wonder when this tired heart will stop it's beating,

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-26 01:21:30	I've done to many drugs, 
You not enough.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-26 02:10:41	"Thirsty Thursdays" 
I've yet to quench this thirst of the mind,
Your love is so unkind in the worldly bind.
I hope myself I one day find.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-26 02:13:11	@g_knapp @PNauticExpress  they're the cures for the ills of our materialistic society, returning one to the self rather than the ego
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-26 02:38:37	All expression is but passion expressed through the false filter of emotion. Anger, sadness, and even happiness are expressions of the mind.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-26 02:41:30	But that "expression" is fueled by passion, the ego being the filter through which we attribute emotion to mere expression. 
Beauty is all.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-26 23:41:39	I wish I still trusted your word.

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-27 01:00:06	I feel as if I've already left this world behind, 
Seeking a love I know I'll never find,
Lost in this world that is ever so unkind.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-27 01:02:55	I need to return to the soul manifesting place beyond my mind. 
Escape the worldly bind.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-27 01:51:45	@clairecarson2 how'd she know...

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-27 02:10:27	@clairecarson2 I'm not worthy of such
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-28 02:10:58	ORWELL!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-27 03:56:05	All these things we've listened to are but misheard words, in these lives we're given many chances to fly like birds.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-27 05:03:22	"I'M GOING TO KISS YOU LIKE THE SUN BROWNS YOU!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-27 08:52:45	When we hear them calling for our death, we must shed our pride and accept our fate, but in acceptance the truth will find, we're all unkind
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-28 04:21:47	To you my hearts no longer tethered, 
For my questions always go unanswered. 
This soul has become weathered,
   In a world full of cancer.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-28 04:30:03	Joyous bliss is always near despite this, for happiness in others we must bear witness!
How I long for your sweet kiss.
Your voice I'll miss
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-24 16:46:14	Our uncertain futures seem to have either beautiful potential or disastrous. 
This world worries me, but I've always got hope for its people
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-24 18:35:10	@Amanda_G_Beck  my mind
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-29 01:10:35	Let's all just pretend we're alive, 
For betterment of the self we all must strive. 
WE'VE CHEATED OUR FATE AGAIN!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-29 01:11:54	YOU'VE GOT A PASSION IN THOSE EYES BUT YOU'RE FAR FROM WISE IN THIS WORLD YOU DESPISE!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-29 01:19:22	Slowly and silently she undresses,
And the world weeps. 
She'll haunt your minds recesses as you'll lose many sleeps.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-29 01:20:05	When she moves it looks like fires, igniting your heart into the deepest of desires.

From up in the underground, 
Watch out for them hounds.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-29 00:42:52	We are all mere reflections of eternity, 
Catching itself at different angles. 
 Sick of all this modernity,
For me it chokes and strangles.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-09-29 00:45:06	I find freedom in her eyes, 
I forget about all the lies and worldly ties,
For in that moment my sadness dies.

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-10-22 02:49:28	How strong is the power of belief?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-10-22 02:56:31	@FuckTheRapGame  but can belief manifest outcome, is this reality malleable to will, and if so what can dogmatic beliefs manifest?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-10-22 03:01:42	@FuckTheRapGame and maybe that belief creates such in your own subjective reality, as well as many others
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-10-22 03:08:47	@FuckTheRapGame my belief is that thought may be far stronger than you think, we're all connected, the way has just yet to be determined
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-10-22 03:12:21	@FuckTheRapGame Jung said the collective unconscious, Sheldrake morphic resonance, and it's had many other names given to it
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-10-22 03:18:42	@FuckTheRapGame a single thought is not a wholehearted, mind consuming belief, which is what I am addressing. These can manifest action,
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-10-22 03:19:34	@FuckTheRapGame  but are not required of action in and of themselves.

His mother could but frown on him,
And all the other sound on him..."

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-12-06 15:52:50	"Finished that exam, now what to do?"
FUCKING SLEEPY TIME

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-12-06 17:31:12	@LogxnGroves But what it entitles is the mystery our species has been trying to determine since we've been able to ask the question
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-12-09 06:18:26	One of my greatest hopes is to simply be remembered as a good man
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-12-09 20:59:51	Let your love loose
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-12-09 21:05:44	We claim everything in the material universe is comprised almost entirely of "empty space"
We simply don't know how to see what that is.
Yet
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-12-09 21:12:38	There's no end to the journey of becoming a better individual. 
It's an ever changing ritual and something that needs to be habitual.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-12-12 09:29:32	So speak to me

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-12-13 06:56:49	Feels like lightning is under my skin,

Oh where will I begin?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-12-13 19:43:28	"HERE I COME BABY! 
I'M COMIN' TO GET YA!"

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-12-19 18:29:30	@cosmologicka that's what I've got a feeling this is

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-12-21 06:56:55	Saw some people,

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-12-21 08:30:49	@cpilla27 I drank some of the absinthe
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-12-21 08:31:36	@cosmologicka this gave me a chuckle

763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-12-21 08:36:40	@cosmologicka well now something to keep my mind up, late on this night
763732375	TryptaminePete	2014-12-23 14:41:09	I killed every man with traps in his hands,
I killed every man to walk down this path,

They wander.
Were these but plots?
This I ponder,
No longer images of your face, 
Although nothing new in place.

"To be honest I don't know anymore, there's just never been much welcome for me."
"You're a fucking weirdo."

Who have you been? 
Are you frightened? 
Will they ever be enlightened?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-01-03 20:47:35	Can’t claim to care, never been reluctant to share,

Come down sweetheart,
 grow up."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-01-05 21:09:40	So tell her that you love her, if you really love her,
But when your heart just ain’t sure, let her go."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-01-05 21:10:17	"Tell her that you’ll be there, if you’ll really be there,

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-01-06 18:14:22	With limitless minds, 
We act like grounded birds. 
Just let go. 
There will always be something more to know,
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-01-06 18:15:07	Aging,
Odd staging, 
Of words and faces, 
Looking for faint traces, 
Never leaving their herds. 
Mindless wars raging,

When you know that's no way to start."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-01-06 19:21:29	Only when you cease searching for happiness in things, others, or drugswill you find it where it always is,

I'll teach you  to see anew,
Your loving is long past due.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-01-06 20:24:22	Searching for love while ignoring the love around you,
Longing for something you thought you once knew,

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-03-05 01:25:06	@Gaianfaerie @ZeLoveGuru  I agree that animal cruelty needs to stop but by simply not eating an animal product you do not save said animal?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-03-05 01:29:08	@ChasingOrenda @Gaianfaerie @ZeLoveGuru that would only apply if the supply didn't exceed the demand in the American world
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-03-05 01:31:09	@ChasingOrenda @Gaianfaerie @ZeLoveGuru the sad truth is that's a picturesque ideal hope that doesn't hold much sway in capitalist society
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-03-05 01:32:40	@ChasingOrenda @Gaianfaerie @ZeLoveGuru  we throw away meat daily, being vegetarian doesn't stop this, it's healthy sure, but doesn't stop

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-03-05 01:51:06	@Gaianfaerie @ChasingOrenda @ZeLoveGuru  ethics of it, merely the worldly result that many falsely believe will occur as a result

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-03-05 01:59:49	@ChasingOrenda @Gaianfaerie @ZeLoveGuru  would like others to believe of you. Go out and save animals don't talk about how not eating meat
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-03-05 02:00:23	@ChasingOrenda @Gaianfaerie @ZeLoveGuru  somehow indirectly saves animals when I've mentioned supply and demand does not apply in the

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-03-05 02:09:43	@ChasingOrenda @Gaianfaerie @ZeLoveGuru  I am arguing me must change our world and it's people not simply how we personally act in it
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-03-05 02:15:33	@ChasingOrenda @Gaianfaerie @ZeLoveGuru yes and when that day has come your argument will have some validity, but in reality that hasn't
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-03-05 02:16:08	@ChasingOrenda @Gaianfaerie @ZeLoveGuru  happened and that's all I've tried to argue, you've blindly attacked me and babbled for far too
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-03-05 02:17:04	@ChasingOrenda @Gaianfaerie @ZeLoveGuru  long and this is getting absolutely ridiculous.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-03-05 02:23:30	@ChasingOrenda @Gaianfaerie @ZeLoveGuru  did I ever say I wasn't? I'm all for peace and love, but I am for intelligence as well.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-03-05 02:25:23	@ChasingOrenda @Gaianfaerie @ZeLoveGuru  and this simply is not intelligence, it is wishful thinking, I show evidence for the increasing

Violence is easy, 
It is harder to peacefully forgive.

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-10 20:12:36	@MGMuzik how does one choose to love or hate anything without knowledge or first expressing it themselves?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-10 20:13:42	@MGMuzik  and are there not forms of productive manifestations of hate, hatred of a disease leads to its cure does it not?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-10 20:36:35	@MGMuzik are they not older than our beliefs of duality, perhaps allowing negativity to consume oneself may make one susceptible to disease?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-10 20:37:29	@MGMuzik  but do you truly think ignoring an entire spectrum of life is a good thing?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-10 20:52:31	@MGMuzik  "when you say the word 'hate' you're.." would not being able to utter a word not promote ignorance of understanding the spectrum?

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-20 22:45:10	It is not thee who seeks love that always finds it,
Sometime love must find you.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-20 22:45:46	They all left without saying farewell
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-23 19:15:43	FUCKING FINISHED THE YEAR,
Now to swim in new waters.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-23 19:22:50	the absurdity off this world is astounding https://t.co/8bkNUzNn75
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-22 18:17:49	She's all right,
But you've got nothing left.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-23 20:19:15	Growing old really is quite the trip
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-22 20:58:12	You're smoother than a rock in a stream
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-23 23:57:18	It only hurts till you die
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-23 23:58:20	It all happens beneath one infinite sky
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-25 10:26:42	Beautiful sunrise http://t.co/pd2i3rTb5B
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 17:38:11	I laugh alone in public far to often to appear sane
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 19:10:12	Making prints always gets me excited
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 19:14:19	The long commute tomorrow, 
What audiobook to listen to?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 19:49:27	Lonesome in London
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 19:56:09	And the tantalizing tingles of the brain begin
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 20:21:04	@BenjaminSaulWar I'm on the other spectrum of the substances for the day but in a similar boat
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 22:02:06	Not with you, 
BUT I'D HATE TO LEAVE YOU!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 22:03:46	Watching our faces age has been so soul gratifying
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 22:05:18	"IF I FIND ANOTHER LOVE IT MUST BE FOREVER TRUE,
BECAUSE IF SOMEONE BREAKS THIS HEART, 
YOUR MAN RIGHT HERE IS THROUGH."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 22:06:26	"Don't leave us down and out again,
Because we might, 
Break instead of bend..."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 23:55:22	We've fallen into dreams so frequently that we've forgot what dreaming is for
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 23:55:38	Forgotten?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-25 00:04:29	@MattF_rd  we are all ignorant of some things, and in that there should be bliss. But succumbing to ignorance is worse than death
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-25 00:09:02	Find the love in all that you do.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-26 14:28:34	"DON'T GIVE YOURSELF AWAY TO THE WEIGHT OF LOVE!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-26 14:30:39	Your subconscious develops from our repeated actions, 
If you repeatedly tell yourself the world isn't perfect, 
Fuck you'll see it that way
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-26 14:53:46	"You wanted to love, 
BUT YOU DIDN'T KNOW HOW!
That's OK,
IT'S UP TO YOU NOW!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-26 14:59:03	"THE ONLY THING I REALLY KNOW, MY LOVE FOR YOU WAS REAL I..."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 15:05:05	Do you hear them tones? 
They're beyond those demonic moans,
But still beneath these bones.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 15:06:57	LIVING THE ONLY LIFE I'VE EVER KNOWN!
Or is it but a repeat of the things we've been shown?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 15:15:37	Always feels weird when you know it's your last day in a place you've called home
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 16:10:51	"WOAH! Man you all right?"
"No, I'm actually half left."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-24 16:26:24	There's a frog, 
A Buddhist, 
And a dragon. 

Something has to come from that right?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 01:12:23	Back to the absinthe http://t.co/N0uN3EWdkA
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 01:16:32	"Now I can't leave it be,
YOUR GOD DAMN MEMORY HAS TAKEN HOLD OF ME!
And your face is all I see."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 01:17:45	"OOOOOOOOH, 
OH OH HO, 
WOAH,
YEAAAAAH!
TO THE CITY OF WASTED DREAMS!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 01:20:01	"FLOATING AND SWIMMING ABOUT, 
Holding the cloud in,
Just to let it out."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 01:21:49	"STANDING IN TRAFFIC, 
I WHALE AND I'LL DANCE, 
Just to watch all the plastics trip as they glance."

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 01:54:14	"DON'T TALK ME DOWN!
I'm trying to see the stars."

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 16:48:42	There's something seductive about a women who smokes
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 17:48:42	I'd rather feel too much than too little
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 17:53:03	Understand that a violent revolution only serves to recreate what was hoping to be overthrown.
PEACE IS FAR EASIER AND IT'S MORE PEACEFUL!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 17:22:17	"Five years going by,
Everyone is standing on their side."

"BUT DON'T YOU LOVE HER?"

"Deep down."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 17:23:27	"Petals getting picked with the love-yous
and the love-you-not."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 17:24:45	"Bet you think you had to BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT! BET YOU NEVER THINK IT FEELS RIGHT"

"Famous-sounding words make your head feel light"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 17:26:38	"Single sleeps alone,
And I know you don't really mind.
Five years by your side,
SO I KNOW YOU DON'T REALLY MIND!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 17:27:43	"Bet you got it all planned right,
Never fit to worry,
NEVER EVEN FEEL A FRIGHT!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 17:30:55	Oh shadows, 
You're beautifully intricate. http://t.co/2Uuwba5G8h
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 18:31:42	My mind's adrift along this universal stream of dreams
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 18:34:39	You deserve far more than you realize

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 20:49:55	If you're unhappy the dreams 
"If only I was somewhere/someone else"
Seem more enticing,
But there's no one or place better than now.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 21:00:20	"I gave her my heart, 
But she want no part so I sold it to an antique store."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 21:03:37	I believe our only purpose in life is to simply live to when we were meant to. 
To outlive our ways of early deaths.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 22:13:59	It's sad that most go to school because they've been told and not due to an yearning for learning.

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-27 16:51:33	@jcub_d @ReallyRedhands @KMAdams_ arrangements can be made
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 22:53:51	Odd moment when you realize it's not others who've changed. 
It's you.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-28 23:25:23	Never forget,
I'll always love you.
Don't regret, 
It will last through all there is to do.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-29 00:45:38	@joshboursier25  some are trapped in stagnation my friend, the same as they've always been.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-27 20:48:07	"I'm waiting on the one I've been thinking of"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-29 13:46:58	Fuck the sun's great
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-29 14:26:09	And I got to think those days are coming to get ya,
NOW NOBODY WANNA PROTECT YA! 
They only wanna forget ya..."

Darling you'd never do nothing, 
BUT YOU WERE ALWAYS UP TO SOMETHING! 
Always outta running,

They speak to me.
I deny my lungs to BREATHE,
A thoughtless guess. 
A freedom left unseen."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-30 03:32:54	I thought it was a soul felt choice,
Or have I lost my voice?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-30 14:26:22	@DailyDoober  the past must be forgiven but not forgotten
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-30 02:56:33	Direct sun, 
You know it's so fun. 
My hearts strung. 
To the songs you've sung.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-30 03:05:12	Also does anyone have the key to the center of the universe's nucleus?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-30 03:11:29	@TheJoeShipton  the debate on the truth of that statement has been what's kept the world in rotation

maybe joy for ever after till I die.
I'm hungry for a change, 
I GOT MY FILL OF OTHERS PAIN!"

You can still break on through.

True truth
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-30 23:39:07	Don't wallow in your own sadness without doing anything to try and remedy it.
It makes you weak.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-30 23:40:44	Can you see the meaning behind the words?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-30 23:41:11	Can you hear the thoughts beyond the talks?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-04-30 23:49:21	Shouldn't have explained that Nitrous oxide is in whip cream canisters to my mom,
This is something I never thought I'd have to say.

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-04 04:02:54	You know me entirely, 
I've made sure of that.

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-04 19:07:08	When was the last time you listened to the song of your soul?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-03 16:11:01	Some days you just can't help but smile

You can have me,
BUT I'M ALL USED UP!

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-03 16:34:27	I cast my mind to the stars a real long while ago and never regretted it
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-04 19:14:17	Soon my flowers with psychedelic blood will greet the glorious mornings, 
But have you ever listened to my warnings?
Lost with torn wings.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-04 19:16:29	We can all remember how we once flew,
I thought you knew.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-03 16:39:08	Scream in the street for no good reason
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-05 10:53:32	Intricate and long dreams that are odd as fuck always make me question what my mind could possibly be trying to tell me.

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-05 12:48:47	@PeyoteCoyotea definitely a book you'd be able to do such a thing with,   I enjoy the thought about rejoining the vegetable matrix

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-05 03:10:33	But I know my socks aren't animals
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-05 03:13:39	@MattF_rd This gave me quite the chuckle
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-05 03:22:58	@MattF_rd  I'm certain there's some lessons to be learned by that teacher, I'm just in no rush to meet her, the time will come when it does

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-06 16:41:45	Always make sure to focus more on the love and beauty of this world rather than its pain and hate.
You're to young to care for such things.

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-08 00:14:46	How can I have grown so much and still be so young?

Sleep pretty darling, 
Do not cry."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-08 20:52:09	What if we were but the bystanders of someone else's dream,
This whole world a synapse in the mind of another,
Can you dig what I mean?

Burst out into a fit of laughter after this one
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-08 22:28:24	Duality got my thoughts all fucked up on reality
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-08 22:53:35	Let me read your written words, 
Let me see what your mind has to say when your mouth is closed.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 00:32:17	I'm getting "cling to the earth so I don't fall off" kind of drunk tonight
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 00:53:09	@Mr_McStevie dangerous move man, don't know if you'll recover from that onw
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 00:53:52	My mind's a mess,
But I'm doing some spring cleaning.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 00:54:55	THE UNIVERSE FLOWS IN THESE VEINS!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 02:42:51	I'LL CLIMB MY WAY BACK DOWN SOMEHOW
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 06:19:35	The moon, 
Been to many days since I've seen her.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 14:14:42	YOU'VE NEVER SEEN MY SOUL,
And now you probably never will.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 14:17:45	CLOUDS ARE SO PSYCHEDELIC, 
I can already tell many hours will be spent with my gaze upon them today.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 07:22:57	I now understand my dream
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 17:17:09	That tree is looking at me weird http://t.co/oDjlvpjLBk
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 17:47:29	“I'll travel anywhere I like", he says.
"I'll travel anywhere I please", he says.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 17:48:46	Just enjoy this trip that is life.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 17:41:36	The difference between expectation and reality is something hard to grasp in its totality.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 17:47:20	"My feet ever slow with the age it takes me,
I'LL SLIP OUT TO THE MOUNTAINS WHERE NOBODY KNOWS ME!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 21:15:05	Let love grow in your mind like a weed,
Growing without boundaries,
And let it grow in the places where nothing else can.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-09 22:24:48	Sun, 
You know I love you,
But can you cool down just a bit?
I want to walk into town without bursting into flames half way there.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 22:32:02	Somehow I feel as it I've lost,
But I've forgotten the game.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-11 13:43:26	A GOOD MONDAY MORNING TO ALL YOU BEAUTIFUL FUCKS!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-11 13:51:58	Can’t stand the high road,

'take the high road'
See you making out.
'TAKE THE HIGH ROAD!'

TALK,
TALK,
TALK TO THE VOICES,

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-11 14:30:52	@clairecarson2  what a pleasant surprise it was to read this, I hope you have a great day beautiful Miss Carson
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-11 14:55:35	Everyone should grow some plants, 
It's good to learn that giving your love to something else shouldn't require immediate gratification.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-11 14:56:37	The more love you put into a plant,
The more beautiful it grows.
We are all like those little plants,
And with some love we can all bloom.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 13:46:06	I've got a worry in my heart, 
but I don't know why
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 13:51:05	They'd seen his face before.
Nobody was really sure,
IF HE WAS FROM THE HOUSE OF LORDS!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 13:52:05	He blew his mind out in a car,
He didn't notice that the lights had changed.
A crowd of people stood and stared,
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-11 16:08:18	"ALWAYS FEELING TIRED,
Smiling when required.
Write another year off and kindly resign."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-11 16:09:07	"Acting like my life's already over,
OH DEAR, 
ACT YOUR AGE AND TRY ANOTHER YEAR!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-11 16:11:15	"Blue boy, 
Older than the world knows, 
'Honey, that's the way that life goes'
No use acting..."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 01:42:48	She was more beautiful to him than the whole world of arts.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 01:46:13	I love this world more and more each day,
More than these useless words can ever seem to say.

Well I just had to laugh,
I saw the photograph.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 13:55:19	That's oddly enough from a rather happy beatles song
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 13:59:18	"LETS SWIM OUT TONIGHT LOVE. 
IT'S OUR TURN TO TRY!
Parked beside the ocean on our moonlight drive."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 03:18:14	"Oh yeah?
OH RIGHT, ARE YOU GONNA BE IN MY DREAMS TONIGHT?"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 03:41:04	"TELL ME BABY,
Our world is so unkind, 
DO YOU WANNA GET HIGHER, 
DO YOU WANNA GO?"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 03:42:44	"I heard you throw your men around,
PICK EM UP JUST TO LET EM DOWN!
It's a shame baby but I always knew,
THE WAY YOU'RE GONNA DO EM!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 03:55:07	"EITHER I'M IN HEAVEN, 
Or I'm in hell.
AM I LOSING MY MIND HERE CAUSE I CAN'T TELL?"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-11 22:44:15	"But why would you do that, it's like poison. You're killing yourself from the inside out?"
"I just let the bad parts of myself die first."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-11 23:23:25	Been wearing 3 nicotine patches for over ten hours now,
FUCK THE WHOLE DAY HAS BEEN SPENT ON THIS SELF INDUCED MENTAL ROLLER COASTER!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 00:45:30	FUCK,
This world breaks my heart.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-11 00:45:24	"HOW'S IT GOING TO END?"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 17:50:44	"BE TRUE TODAY!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 17:53:02	"A pretty nice girl,
But she doesn't have a lot to say.
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl,
BUT SHE CHANGES FROM DAY TO DAY!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 17:54:16	"SHE CAME IN THROUGH THE BATHROOM WINDOW!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 17:59:21	"Boy, you're gonna carry that weight,
CARRY THAT WEIGHT A LONG TIME!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 18:00:48	"AND IN THE END 
THE LOVE YOU TAKE, 
IS EQUAL TO THE LOVE
YOU MAKE!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 18:02:56	"I'VE GOT YOU TO LET,
me down."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 18:05:11	"I WANNA BE FORGOTTEN,
and I don't want to be reminded.
you say 'please don't make this harder'
no I won't"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 18:06:40	"I was afraid that you would not insist."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 18:09:33	"I said wait, I'm gonna give it a break.
I'm not your friend,
I never was."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 18:11:50	"Deaf and dumb but fluent speech.
SPEAKING SPEAKS AND LISTENING!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-10 18:14:12	"I've got my hands on it,
I'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY OUT!
Bring all my people with me."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 02:52:26	Fuck I'm drunk and it's monday.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 02:55:38	To back your lying lips
I'LL NEVER KNOW JUST WHAT I DID IT FOR!
Bullet in the brain,
I prefer them to remain the same."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 02:55:45	"I know I share the blame for what's in store,
I was in the wrong,
But weren't you in it more?
I let you use my gifts,
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 02:56:35	FUCK YOU PHONE,
Than not "them"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 02:58:52	If you want clarity and recollection of dreams, nicotine patches act as a friendly ally.
That is if you can sleep with lady nicotine.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 03:04:14	"WHAT MOM DON'T KNOW HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL ON ME!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 03:24:14	Well I guess the absinthe needed to be finished one of these nights
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 03:26:12	"THOUGH I NEVER PRAY,
GOD REIGNS TODAY!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 03:28:03	"MY EAR UPON THE HEART OF BABYLON!
Crying now they speak to me."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 03:28:52	"STOP MOVING TOWARDS THAT PERFECT SOUND!
THERE'S BLOOD IN THEIR MOUTHS!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 03:33:37	START ANEW!
FORGET THE THINGS YOU KNEW!
Become who you were meant to.
Those lies are through.
Life's meant for something true. 
I love you.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-11 02:46:05	My family always gets me to drink as often as they possibly can but hey I don't like to drink every day.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-11 02:46:06	Do we know the proper things to say?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 12:20:20	"I want to go,
WHERE NOBODY CARES WHETHER OR NOT I'M THERE! 
All I need is a drink and a chair."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 13:04:28	The birds don't cease their songs due to clouds,
So why do you?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 13:08:56	The days I actually consume coffee are the days I feel like I could swim through the air to the sun.
I like coffee,
A little too much.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 13:11:32	@MattF_rd  I drink tea daily but save coffee for the special days of extreme sleepiness or when the craving comes a calling hahaha
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-12 20:48:19	"Your heart and your mind,
Play dumb,
Like when you were still young."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-13 13:40:08	Go enjoy the day, 
Do it for me,
Would you do that champ?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-13 14:28:45	Be better today than you were yesterday
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-13 22:54:28	@MattF_rd  Why thank you my friend, I shall try not to let down your expectations
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-14 01:10:19	Venus looks rather beautiful tonight

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-14 14:05:46	You caught my eyes,
Not my heart.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-14 14:39:20	"HONEY, the stars keep on calling my name,
But don't worry. 
I told you again and again.
When I'm down you're always the first one to know."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-14 14:46:07	Dance with fire, 
Listen to its emberous choir. 
Will you join that pyre?
Ignite that soul with sweet desire,
For with me you'll never tire.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-14 14:56:14	Ignore the hate they acquire,
There's no love in a screaming liar. 
Forgive all that's prior,
And you'll have all that your soul requires.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-13 16:13:41	"GOT TO BE A JOKER,
He just do what he please."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-14 15:19:25	Those things we've all forgot,
May bring upon this society's rot.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-14 15:48:38	A faithful soul for hire.

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-15 15:50:09	I've seen you in my mind,
Heard you on my skin, 
Tasted you in my heart,
And yet together we never find,
We never win.
We've yet to start.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-15 15:53:55	"DANCE ALL NIGHT CAUSE PEOPLE THEY DON'T WANNA BE LONELY!
Never wanna be lonely. 
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE AN ONLY!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-15 16:26:15	HEY!

You're looking beautiful today
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-15 16:37:04	"You think that I don't know,

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-15 16:57:03	Any caps I do, 
Picture me screaming those words in your mind.
Many of you likely can, 
I'm a screamer,
But can be hard to find.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-15 17:05:16	"That time before,
YOU COULDA BEEN MY LOVE!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-14 21:11:51	"What's this young man to do?"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-15 17:52:11	@TheJoeShipton I likely have with a few of them my friend
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-16 13:40:53	Does what you say hold true when held accountable to your actions?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-16 13:43:57	"OUT OF COLLEGE, 
MONEY SPENT!
See no future,
Pay no rent.
All the money's gone,
NO WHERE TO GO!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-16 13:43:59	"But oh,
That magic feeling."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-16 19:02:30	Don't be a stranger,
I'll never put you in danger.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-16 19:05:23	There was something I was thinking earlier this week
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-16 20:26:42	"Saturday was actually a crazy night for me"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-16 22:32:37	MIGHTY FINE DAY! http://t.co/rOmAwMh5ZB

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-17 02:21:15	Who was she?
Sparked dreams,
That blazed into my waking life.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-17 11:32:37	I'm hungry for some tasty breakfast
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-17 12:19:25	I see flowers amongst the dead,
Looks inviting,
But not frightening.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-17 12:31:45	"And
If
I
Never

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-17 12:50:00	Let me mesmerize those pretty eyes
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-17 13:17:11	"YOU NEVER GIVE ME YOUR MONEY! 
You only give me your funny paper."
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-17 13:21:09	How can this stay have only lasted half of May?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-17 14:55:14	No one won world war one.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-05-17 14:56:07	(that rhyme had me in fits of laughter)

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-03 17:17:42	Some lines in my journal don't make sense to even me http://t.co/Ltd1Njsi68
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-03 18:49:57	Any day can be your last, 
So don't fill your days with thoughts of the past.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-05 01:08:23	Fuck I love nature http://t.co/S6CicDWewp
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-04 04:57:25	I won't seduce you with empty dreams
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-05 15:20:24	I don't believe I will ever truly understand my dreams
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-05 16:01:09	Why be dishonest?
It's so much easier and enjoyable to be truthful.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-05 23:25:07	"I would speak up,
BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-05 18:08:17	I AM A CREATOR OF ORDER,
A MASTER OF CHAOS,
AND THE AVOIDER OF DISORDER!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-04 14:12:50	I pity my elders,
I already feel quite old at only two decades. 
So FUCK,
How bad does it get?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-04 14:34:36	MY WORDS WILL BLAZE LIKE FIRE IN THE AIR! 
Tear away that despair,
And love without a consuming care.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-05 23:40:15	"I hope she knows that I'll love her long,
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE THE HELL I BELONG!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-04 16:37:19	IT
IS 
SO
FUCKING
BEAUTIFUL
OUTSIDE
RIGHT!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-06 05:18:30	Dreamt of dying at twenty-seven since the age of eleven. 
Now, 
My greatest fear is my dreams becoming fate. 
I know I'm not a so great,
Yet
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-06 05:28:27	The love of words ceases to end. 
My mind,
WILL MEND,
Eventually.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-06 05:54:54	WELL YOU KNOW IT'S A FOOL WHO PLAYS IT COOL
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-06 18:05:47	The Raven spoke in rhymes and whistles, 
Led me through vines and thistles, 
To a beautiful world I thought I'd never find,
Inside my mind.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-08 00:42:30	STOP AND STARE,
THERE'S FUCKING BEAUTY EVERYWHERE!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-07 04:33:17	Drunk drawing http://t.co/ZH9DVLTxPI
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-07 04:34:22	I will never forget who you were to me
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-08 04:44:40	GIVE
ME
A
PLACE
TO 
STAND
AND
I
Will move the Earth.
I've seen this universe's birth,
Learned my life's infinite worth.
Forgive,
Love,
Live.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-09 02:13:07	You have all the hopes of heaven.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-09 02:15:00	Talk to yourself,
FEW WILL EVER LISTEN!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-09 02:19:21	There's a fuckton of good in this world, 
Few bits of evil,
But atrocities are more memorable than acts of beauty. 
Maybe a mindful change?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-09 02:35:24	Always assume ignorance rather than malice in how others treat you,
Few truly realize the pain they'll cause, 
And most are fucking idiots.

PRETTY FAST OUT HERE?
Oh just wait my dear,
TILL WE GET UP THERE!"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-09 16:27:11	Failed love should only make the heart stronger.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-10 15:17:55	"Yet he bore all his sufferings without a groan,

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-11 20:55:34	The greatest thing you can do for others in this day and age is simply listen without waiting to speak or assuming to know the meaning
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-11 20:57:45	Spend some time alone outside, 
It's good for the soul.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-10 20:54:05	Be careful who you reveal yourself to,
Some just listen for gossip they can repeat.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-10 20:55:17	I've known you for too long.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-10 21:33:41	@ReallyRedhands  some people don't have the minds for such a thing, nothing to condemn them for, and it's only some. Not all
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-11 14:36:35	I enjoy being in the sun wholeheartedly
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-13 00:00:00	"Alcohol?"
"Do I have hands?"
"No,
You're

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-13 01:33:02	Do you design your own life or succumb to the fuckery of others?

WHY I'M FEELING LOW? http://t.co/FMiQest9wm
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-13 18:49:26	I
WANT
IT
all.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-13 04:32:07	Quietly my mind screams
TOWARDS THEIR WORLDLY DREAMS!
But existence is within this world, 
So why fear it's pleasures?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-12 11:50:47	So GLAD I SLEPT IN
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-13 11:35:27	Why can't I stay asleep for longer than a few hours? 
WHY WORLD WHY?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-13 11:50:07	It is odd how the mind can filter beauty into something grotesque
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-15 01:51:35	Treat those you love well,
And those you hate better.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-12 15:19:10	@mambcity Strange, I know
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-13 12:11:56	This world is filled with things that seem to be opposites, 
But they're all the same.
THE PATTERNS REPEAT IN ALL MANIFESTATIONS OF NATURE!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-13 12:25:33	THERE'S SO MANY THINGS I WISH TO SAY, 
But the way in which words capture feelings always seems like play.
I'll just walk away,
If I ever...
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-13 12:41:35	A good morning http://t.co/uosCqLCRat
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-12 18:48:56	Wake and listen, YOU THAT ARE LONELY! http://t.co/QwnAVhaoBu
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-13 18:28:25	I'll make it as far as these legs will take me.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-14 20:41:30	Do they know you as I do?
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-15 01:44:43	Strange night. http://t.co/rRN8o51qDZ
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-15 16:37:37	Too long I've thought about the thoughtless.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-15 16:37:58	The more he listened, 
The more he heard.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-15 16:40:46	Read a bunch of Greek tragedies and now I'm happy.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-15 16:42:53	As fucked up as my life gets, 
I know I am no

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-16 16:46:23	@clairecarson2 @HeatherBrouwer3 @mambcity @pmatging10 I think in this situation it's Heather that needs to be thanked, she's kind of God
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-17 01:58:35	@E_Foan I'd be honored if you did
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-16 16:43:56	@HeatherBrouwer3 @clairecarson2 @mambcity @pmatging10 at least now I can rest easy

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-17 07:51:06	"What's wrong?"
"I'd hoped I was the protagonist of my own life, now I think I'm the villain, and in good intentions I've lost my way" 
"Sh"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-16 22:21:41	I would not be here without you
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-16 22:42:54	Surreptitiously singing sights to sounds, 
Running from the hounds of love, 
I find myself alone, 
BUT NEVER LONELY!
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-17 16:04:54	You cannot conquer hate if you do not learn to love.

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-19 16:02:35	What a beautiful day to lounge in the sun
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-19 16:09:36	You better learn to deal with yourself now, 
For nothing ever truly gets any easier, 
But you can learn to forgive and cope in many ways.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-19 16:11:33	It's a shame that we lie about how the world is to children, 
while almost never attempting to create such a world.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-19 16:12:31	My intentions were always pure.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-18 22:01:23	YOU

I had to say.

763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-18 15:59:53	Computer style consciousness theory:
Death = finality (in an infinite universe)
Radio consciousness: 
Death = simply something new
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-18 16:01:14	"You bore me"
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-18 16:02:21	@soloennyc  I stay away from technology while tripping, I'm as sober as a stone right now
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-18 15:57:28	There's a likely possibility that consciousness is received by the brain like a radio receives a signal.
Damage the radio the signal remains
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-18 15:58:28	Our brains could be like computers, requiring all their individual hard drives and softwares to function and produce this image that is you.
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-18 16:14:35	I still believe I'd rather feel all the fucky-ness of the world than none of it.

OVER!
I'm now taking over
763732375	TryptaminePete	2015-06-20 02:28:55	I WANNA BE FORGOTTEN!
