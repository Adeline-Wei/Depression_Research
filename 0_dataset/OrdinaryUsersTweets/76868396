76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-04-23 07:11:38	Had a cool ass dream where I moved to a place called Navarro in America. It was hot, sandy and there were no crabs. Heaven.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-04-23 07:12:03	Turns out it's a real place. Don't know about their crab policy though.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-04-23 08:02:47	Why does everyone care about that weird boobed woman getting an abortion? If it helps further what she calls a 'career' then why not?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-04-23 08:03:36	That's one of the reasons they're available, right? People wouldn't get upset if a scientist got an abortion so they could carry on research

76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-13 09:54:12	@TimShaw_ @YourMomBot I guess I should sit the fuck down

76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-16 09:57:19	Straight up buttery toast is underrated. Nah mean?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-14 23:56:43	Pretty much had a semi on during that whole set. So fucking good.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-16 20:01:50	Why would you have a pet peacock?

76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-15 08:36:53	Work is killing my soul. I wanna watch the Chilis again.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-17 08:34:44	@Reedykinsyo Low maintenance and cheap

76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-17 22:03:23	My back is constantly mashed. Need a 24/7 back massage.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-18 22:48:54	Just went to have some of my drink and found a fly drowning in it. Now I feel guilty and thirsty.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-18 22:59:52	Can't get comfortable because my dogs keep farting :(
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-19 09:06:51	According to my scales I've lost a stone since being home, but I can see bugger all difference. Ah whatever.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-19 09:52:43	Hoddle would've fucked up Ryde High when it became Ryde Academy anyway. At least this new guy has a sick name. #DrRoryFox
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-19 20:10:19	@grimeeee So jealous! I loved Budapest
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-19 20:46:37	@grimeeee I went to some bath spa place, which was stunning! (if you excuse the portly, hairy Hungarian men). Have a great time.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-20 20:15:32	Ventnor is such a beautiful place. Such a shame it's full of the crackiest of crackheads.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-19 19:38:39	@jo_prismall You still ate it though, right? That sounds incredible
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-19 19:42:38	Payday today and Steam Sale starts today... Dangerous mix
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-19 20:29:27	Love getting some next-level turbo munch on the go after getting home from work
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-19 21:43:10	I reckon a lot of you guys have a great chance of managing England next. You seem to know your shit.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-19 09:50:43	I want bands who had to work for their keep, drove a thousand miles and played a show on no sleep
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-19 12:59:01	I miss the days of playing Runescape and listening to The Offspring in my pants. Last week seems like so long ago.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-21 03:37:09	Oh cool. As soon as I get out of bed my dogs jump in and go straight to sleep. Way to rub it in, chaps.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-19 20:10:44	Come on England, you need to sports harder :(
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-19 20:59:58	6am start tomorrow is going to be balls but at least I got to set my alarm for 4.20 #smokeweederryday #papersbongsblunts #devilslettuce
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-22 10:10:57	@JoshuaCollyer So how many games have you bought so far?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-22 14:33:39	Is it okay to have a whiskey before you've even brushed your teeth?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-22 14:36:13	@TimShaw_ I don't get the reference. Sorry.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-22 14:46:51	I'm not your buddy, guy
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-22 15:06:01	Everytime I'm not in Bristol a sick act plays in the shitty venue behind where I live. First I missed Mike Watt, and now Frank Turner.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-22 15:57:37	@RobPerks his band Mongol Horde are, £15 on the door tomorrow I think man

76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-20 20:47:35	I'm a simple man. I like pretty, dark haired women and breakfast food.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-23 00:33:01	Shouldn't have left my windows open. Bare moths. Mad mosquito ting.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-23 00:40:34	Some of these moths are too big and ugly to even fly properly. Why does the world need such monstrosities?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-23 00:55:10	I love daytime wildlife. But nighttime creatures like rats, moths and badgers, fuck those mutants.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-23 00:55:50	@Reedykinsyo Nah dude, they're irritating and creepy looking
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-23 18:47:20	@stephaniealiceR @missvickmarie Ouch...

76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-23 20:58:29	@robdelaney Be inside before dark and don't even think about swimming in/going anywhere near the Thames
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-23 01:02:46	@GraceCrumplin How comes?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-23 01:07:19	@GraceCrumplin Fuuuuuuck that!
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-23 01:10:47	@GraceCrumplin Oh I would, but I'm a huge wuss
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-23 01:16:23	@GraceCrumplin If it makes you feel any better I can't sleep since a shrek sized moth flew into my face whilst I was trying to snooze
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-23 08:57:03	@Holly_Poo Crunchy erryday
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-23 11:12:20	My hair is far too thick for this weather
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-23 11:12:34	Need to be in the sea
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-26 08:31:57	I dread to think how much I've spent on Steam over the years
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-26 08:39:41	Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga choo choo?

76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-24 20:35:30	Getting quite used to being blonde now. Brown hair is for losers.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-24 23:23:27	Happy birthday to my favourite immigrant, @MarcinSeder. Don't get too shedaisied x
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-25 15:09:25	@ChalicePotato that's what I'm gonna do! (I locked him in the conservatory)
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-25 11:16:27	You done messed up, A-A-Ron!
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-25 14:05:42	A man who'd trade his liberty for a safe and dreamless sleep, doesn't deserve the both of them and neither shall he keep
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-27 09:26:32	I'm working all day so if anyone hears Connor or Callum Warren on iow radio please text/tweet me xxxx

76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-28 20:21:45	Haven't gotten sideways in a while
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-28 21:44:18	@aliceistyping Lucky!
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-29 18:28:33	Stuck in a rut
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-29 22:09:20	I just don't see what's wrong with having a nice glass of wine with a pancake
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-27 10:14:07	Took me almost an hour to get to Ryde. Southern Vectis, you've hit a new low.

76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-27 21:58:07	Kind of gotten used to having the back of an 80 year old miner
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-27 21:59:00	How it feels that is. I'm not sure what an 80 year old miner's back looks like. Wrinkly...
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-27 21:59:51	And sooty I imagine. From all the coal. Assuming he/she's a coal miner. Just wrinkly if they're not. Maybe a bit dusty?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-27 22:23:36	@JamesOverTail @grimeeee Get a Bottle of Bow and head down Simeon rec. Just as threatening/grim as Ryde town on a Friday and cheaper.

76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-27 22:27:39	@Rhi4nna Fair enough. Didn't know people still played.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-06-27 23:02:52	@grimeeee @JamesOverTail Sweet. I'm sat on the swings in case you do come down.

76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-07-01 15:41:22	@aliceistyping What's all this 'Break start' and 'Break end' added by so and so? I did a 6 hour shift and apparently took a 2 hour break...
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-07-01 15:45:17	@aliceistyping It's not good :/ will have to have a word, something seems awry

76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-07-01 19:44:34	Too tired to do anything, too hot to nap. Is this hell?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-07-02 00:22:46	Never realised how old Bristol was!

76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-07-03 12:38:04	Didn't get paid today because someone changed my bank details when entering them into the system. This morning's been a steamy pile o balls!
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-07-04 16:43:20	Used a day off to run errands. Today I became an adult.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-07-04 17:43:09	We can work through this marriage, @Fearnecotton. It's just a mild speedbump in our relationship.

76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-21 05:36:34	Wisdom teeth are bastards
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-21 23:31:10	@jessicacolley_ Sorted one now. Thank you anyway!
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-20 08:02:58	@GazReyy Can't imagine that'll take too long. I'll get right on that.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-22 10:34:51	@JoeMoePelletier Sunday. Get on some Silent Hill pre/post-jam?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-22 13:11:02	If I get one more snapchat of someone's poop or someone pooping I'm going to cry
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-22 13:23:27	I'm even more lazy than usual when I know I have to get ready for work #effort
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-20 09:49:20	I am here today to pump up the uplift mofo party plan, a plan based on a band, a band based on a plan
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-21 17:29:51	Playing Silent Hill 2 earlier has put me on edge for the rest of the day
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-20 21:35:54	@GazReyy what a noob
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-20 21:39:42	Worked my summer away with almost no money to show for it
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-23 00:06:42	Ryde is full of cunts tonight
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-23 00:08:23	@MarcinSeder What's up with it bud?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-23 00:32:57	@rosywatts_ Bloody fridays
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-23 00:58:34	When isn't scrambled egg on toast a good shout?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-23 01:23:04	My dog takes up 3/4 of my double bed. Both impressive and annoying.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-22 09:57:20	Sorry but I can't justify spending money on Trapped In The Closet just to say I own it
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-24 19:22:16	OD'd on chicken kievs
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-24 21:51:52	I like to put my character to bed and turn off the lights before I save &amp; quit on Animal Crossing. He's a good lad.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-24 00:38:58	My back has had enough
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-25 11:18:13	The temptation to call in sick for work gets stronger as my bed gets comfier
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-25 11:18:35	Plus that rain can eat a bag of dicks
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-25 20:33:22	Tomorrow's day off has turned into 14 hours of work #regret
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-25 21:52:07	@Dovahhkiinn hahaha ritml (rolling in the money laughing)
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-25 22:14:19	Eaten so much couscous I can't even breathe
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-24 09:55:19	I may have a burnt face, but that doesn't mean I can't fight crime
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-24 10:33:55	Buzzing for @Skindredmusic at Bestival
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-26 06:01:50	Will the rain ruin a suede/fur coat?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-28 18:47:32	Poor kids dressing like they're rich, rich kids dressing like they're poor
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-28 21:20:09	What is your major malfunction, numbnuts?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-26 22:09:06	My life is just protein, gym, macros, gains #legs
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-26 22:40:16	@JamesOverTail What's 'rest day'?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-26 22:40:59	@jackhayward8 it ain't easy being swole
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-26 22:48:57	@RobPerks if we can snuggle then I'm down to watch it
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-26 22:49:12	@JoeMoePelletier Yes! How many episodes in are you?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-26 22:51:54	@RobPerks I can braid your hair. I know the couch isn't very deep but we can move the back cushion and spoon.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-26 22:52:53	@JoeMoePelletier Fair play haha. Shorter episodes make it so addictive.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-26 22:54:06	Unearthing my belly button fluff after a long day's labour makes it all worth it
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-28 22:12:46	Food boners are a thing
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-26 23:10:40	@Jordan__OConnor Wish it was Bestival every weekend
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-28 19:49:36	@drpepper will you be doing the pants or prizes promotion again in the UK soon? I need new underwear
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-27 12:37:19	Why are people doing the ice bucket challenge donating to Macmillan? I thought it was an ALS awareness thing. Charity's charity I suppose...
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-30 00:52:00	Pretty much inhaled a whole load of crumpets with Marmite. Too hungry, too good.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-30 20:52:02	Flipped my last burger until christmas #McFree
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-30 20:53:49	Might start predrinking for Bestival
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-31 21:50:24	2 big bars of fruit &amp; nut and doritos. I think this may be the end for me.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-31 22:03:46	J-Law #dayum
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-31 00:10:29	@Dovahhkiinn That man is the opposite of funny
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-31 00:18:56	Been holding back some promising beard growth all summer. Really excited to see how this attempt goes.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-01 12:40:22	Anyone found any places on the isle of wight with a good deal on tents? I appear to be without one
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-30 10:50:40	Hey Twitter. I brushed my hair for the first time in ages today, mental. Cx
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-08-30 10:51:41	@YourMomBot God dammit
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-01 22:48:56	'If any could desire what he is incapable of possessing, despair must be his eternal lot.'
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-01 23:15:33	Need to iron my snakeskin leggings for Bestival
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-01 12:42:48	@EllenMcCrimmon That's pretty decent! I'll head there, cheers
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-01 15:57:59	@EllenMcCrimmon £25 barry bargain, thanks for the heads-up
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-01 21:12:10	@RosieeBird That's a lather ridiculous price
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-01 21:14:52	Bored of everything that used to pepper my gravy so I'm going to grumble on Twitter
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-01 21:19:02	@RosieeBird I fear you may have missed my incredible pun :(
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-01 21:20:39	@Reedykinsyo Ta for the tip, Nigella Lawson
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-01 21:23:02	@Reedykinsyo I never imagined Zorro to be a great cook
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-02 21:34:47	@joshuacollyer @joemoepelletier on my way home now if you're still game
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-02 16:07:29	I'm no longer a blonde bombshell
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-03 21:01:36	Exhausted, but I gotta pack my bags and I won't sleep because it's just starting to sink in that Bestival's tomorrow and I might cry
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-04 06:26:21	Pretty sly that we can't use rovers on the Bestival buses this year @SouthernVectis
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-04 07:16:34	@RosieeBird @SouthernVectis http://t.co/ExevU6ZXVe nope :/
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-04 07:22:00	@RosieeBird @SouthernVectis fair play, i didn't see that! pretty handy I guess.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-04 07:25:26	Bestival today selfie x http://t.co/8JE8s8wryI
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-04 07:27:39	@jackhayward8 thanks for noticing ;) I wasn't even tensing! #believeitornot
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-03 10:22:04	Need to resist the urge to crack into my Bestival munchies
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-03 10:22:28	@MarcinSeder Text me where you're camping my friend
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-03 10:32:21	@MarcinSeder You know this
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-03 11:01:25	@grimeeee I expected more of you, Cruella :/
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-03 21:47:36	This new beard is really growing on me (literally)
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-07 22:23:17	Sweet Bestival. I'm half the man I was on Thursday.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-08 21:00:23	@Dovahhkiinn Should have got his number, it was pretty gnarly #fierce
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-08 21:15:00	@Dovahhkiinn oh right
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-08 21:28:22	@Dovahhkiinn I hate how you can compliment and completely destroy me in one sentence
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-10 15:29:07	Set up the wifi. I am now officially moved into my new place!
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-08 13:17:39	Still gutted that Busta Rhymes was cancelled
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-08 13:57:27	@aisiamarie Oh sweet baby jesus that looks incredible
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-09 12:48:32	Stupid sexy Flanders
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-09 13:03:08	@jackhayward8 Hahah was nice seeing you briefly over the Besti man, looking hench as fuck (sincerely, and no homo)
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-09 13:39:02	@jackhayward8 you always know the right things to say
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-09 23:20:38	Hansel. So hot right now. Hansel.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-08 19:54:56	@aisiamarie where!?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-08 19:57:05	Still being punished for eating from a questionable looking hog roast stand last night, but I'd do it all again because I love hog roast.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-08 20:27:36	Been on a serious Major Lazer hype today. They were so good yesterday, can't believe I've never given them a proper listen.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-08 20:52:31	@Dovahhkiinn I feel I outbearded them all though
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-10 07:39:31	Back to bris-town today
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-11 12:23:56	Online grocery shopping is pants. I'm hungry now, not tomorrow between 11-12.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-10 10:16:08	Eaten all my train munchies before I've even left the station :(
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-11 19:22:09	Bestival blues has just hit me hard
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-12 15:06:18	Need to invest in one of those bicycle things
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-12 16:30:44	No joke just ghost pooed. Not sure how to feel... #pooaranormalactivity
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-12 16:47:00	@TimShaw_ @YourMomBot Zip it you two
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-14 21:27:51	I will smash your face into a car windshield, then take your mother, Dorothy Mantooth, out for a nice seafood dinner &amp; never call her again!
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-15 08:05:19	Where are you, student loan? :(
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-15 15:41:27	Have a bath? Get a bike!
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-14 10:40:06	There's a spider the size of the sun in my garden
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-13 12:57:54	I love you so much, wine. Why do you make me feel this way...
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-13 15:51:37	'Hold up playa, what you diggity doing here?' 'I should diggity ask you the same!'
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-15 23:48:05	2nd in the pub quiz. Next week will be ours.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-16 22:32:22	I miss my little island today
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-17 07:03:37	Good morning, student loan :)
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-17 08:11:04	Didn't have time for my morning coffee and I'm struggling horribly
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-17 13:27:43	Super tempted to buy a new guitar now my loan's through
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-17 17:16:47	Found out I live down the road from Carol Vorderman. If she makes the first move then do I have permission to take it further @Dovahhkiinn?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-17 17:17:36	@Dovahhkiinn So slack
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-17 17:23:40	@Dovahhkiinn I was going to anyway
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-18 22:13:27	Glad I didn't go out tonight now. That storm looks like effort...
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-18 23:26:07	2 half pounder burgers coming directly at your boy if ya can dig
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-19 21:55:15	I'm drunk and I have access to Twitter. What on earth do I do?!
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-17 22:15:28	Flooded half the house whilst playing Just Dance 4. Sweatiest man alive.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-17 22:28:46	That's numberwang!
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-20 02:42:20	@TimShaw_ you got it
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-20 10:10:04	Need a kettle in my room. Coffee's too far away.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-20 20:02:18	Saturday night with nout going down. Time to get right amongst Phoenix Wright.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-20 21:01:15	If you have a man bun then you're probably a bit of a nob
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-21 00:42:03	@Dovahhkiinn Bit weird
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-21 00:51:05	@Dovahhkiinn No way. I've got a real one, brah.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-21 00:54:35	@Dovahhkiinn Ah cheers
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-21 18:21:11	@ChrisObbard You buy cheap, you buy twice
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-21 18:22:20	@MeganAlice9 they're my favourite, so so good
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-21 20:11:59	Just went for my first run in forever after doing no exercise and smoking too much. Even enjoyed it a bit? My body amazes me.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-23 09:20:42	Trying to establish a decent sleeping pattern is hard work
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-23 11:36:10	Still can't work out why I love Animal Crossing so much
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-23 11:39:30	@GazReyy Yeah dude. So good!
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-23 11:42:15	@GazReyy You're my hero
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-22 12:20:45	Bought a t shirt which is spun from pure funk. God damn.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-24 21:07:22	Still chuffed the pub round the corner from me serves K Cider
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-24 21:26:13	@AsherRose21 I shit you not. Big cans as well, not those flimsy new little cans.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-23 09:21:36	The manager, Bevan, starts to abuse me. Hey man, I just want some muesli.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-23 18:22:35	@Dovahhkiinn I was thinking of evicting them. Your green nasty tent is an eyesore in my beautiful town.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-23 18:25:10	@Dovahhkiinn My townspeople have been complaining, sorry :/ I've got to be a fair mayor.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-25 18:20:35	Gimme the loot
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-24 13:08:04	Fuck that http://t.co/7KCsrNLjLO
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-24 13:19:09	I ain't crazy and I ain't a guy
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-26 16:22:36	I'm slamming niggas like Shaquille, shit is real, when it's time to eat a meal, I rob and steal
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-26 16:47:11	@TimShaw_ @YourMomBot Only good one he's had really
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-27 15:47:33	Grandmaster Flash in October, Mos Def &amp; Afrika Bambaataa in November. Could be worse!
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-27 12:19:06	Got my ticket to go see Mos Def. Awh hell yeah.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-27 14:26:57	The Fonz was on the Isle of Wight and nobody told me?!
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-29 17:26:18	@aliceistyping Haha classic Meredith
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-30 17:23:59	Up to my ass in alligators, let's get it on with the alligator haters
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-09-28 19:25:33	The Meters really hit the greezy nerve #toofunky

76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-10-03 21:34:49	Is it okay to order a figurine of myself?
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-10-04 18:50:03	@Reedykinsyo I was saying this earlier! So brisk.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-10-03 18:16:43	Monster, custard doughnuts and Doritos. God damn. My only regret is that I bought cool original.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-10-03 18:55:30	@RobPerks I know man :/ thought i'd try something different, biggest mistake of my life
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-10-03 18:56:56	@stephaniealiceR No way! They don't cleanse the palate enough between doughnuts. Chilli heatwave is what the night needed.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-10-05 23:49:36	Balls are ridiculous
76868396	ConnorRay_	2014-10-05 23:50:16	@GazReyy I hate that cough too

76868396	ConnorRay_	2015-05-08 09:23:18	@kynantaylor Can I ask why you support Conservatives? Genuine question, just interested to know
76868396	ConnorRay_	2015-05-08 09:31:35	@kynantaylor That's fair man. Something does need to be done about those things. Just hope they don't go crazy on the NHS.
76868396	ConnorRay_	2015-05-08 09:39:09	@kynantaylor No doubt unsustainable atm. Health tourism is bad &amp; NHS need to be way stricter. The NHS makes this country great in my opinion
