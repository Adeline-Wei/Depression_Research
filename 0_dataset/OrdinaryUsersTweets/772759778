772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-05-24 03:53:20	Yeah I'm not going to school tomorrow. Fun night.
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-05-24 04:24:36	If cruise was that fun, I can't imagine how fun 6 flags will be. 👍
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-05-24 04:34:11	@TheSeanDoc or just any dance. Didn't even have to be on the boat
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-05-24 04:39:55	I want to see the purge so bad.
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-05-24 14:07:30	I always feel guilty playing Xbox on the days I don't go to school. But oh well.
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-05-24 19:55:51	Why can't I play in local tournaments. Hotels are starting to feel like my home. #baseballprobs
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-05-26 18:43:44	I always miss my dog so much when I go to tournaments. Haha Is that weird?
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-05-24 21:31:55	I feel sooooo awkward when I'm peeing and my dogs in the bathroom.
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-05-24 22:41:57	Kind of pissed I didn't get to go to the aquarium today.
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-05-28 01:45:50	Best day I've had in awhile 😊
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-05-25 02:47:49	Day 1 in Lancaster for baseball tournament. Yet to see an Amish person.
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-05-25 03:38:44	It just sucks knowing that when I lose you, I won't have anyone here for me.
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-05-25 11:51:53	Hotel showers &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 👌
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-05-30 00:36:24	I can't believe this is happening

772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-01 00:21:57	@Mike_Alessandro I wouldn't be able to do it. It pisses me off the list because you know how close me and him are and it's like he forgets

772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-07 20:39:12	@sarahmatro1999 you know that's not the real reason.
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-07 23:48:06	If there isn't a movie theater around here, I'm gonna flip. I need to see the purge.
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-08 00:00:44	I really just drove for 4 hours. I better have this damn tournament
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-08 00:21:21	@sarahmatro1999 made it here alive
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-08 00:32:50	@sarahmatro1999 half the ride she couldn't see anything cuz of the rain
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-08 03:18:37	Idk why I didn't figure that would happen
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-08 03:36:46	Ding dong ditch in hotels. 😂
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-08 04:11:31	Nothing last forever..
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-08 04:49:28	This is why I have major trust issues.

772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-07 00:44:26	@sarahmatro1999 talking about Pam? Awkward
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-09 22:42:53	Probably witnessed one of the best coach ejection today. 😂😂
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-10 01:14:55	The fact we beat the iron pigs team today blows my mind.
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-07 17:16:39	Our school is so messed up. Only one week left and that happens
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-07 17:45:25	@Mike_Alessandro that'd just be too easy
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-07 17:51:25	@Mike_Alessandro it's all because one kid knows how to make everyone change
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-07 17:54:34	@Mike_Alessandro no no it's not like that
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-07 17:58:07	You don't even go here 😂 #damien
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-07 18:02:37	You going down tonight? @TuckerByrne13
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-07 18:03:41	@TuckerByrne13 I hope there's shit near the hotel. Especially a movie theater. In trying to see the PURGE

772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-18 18:05:09	The fact that I haven't played baseball in like a week amazes me.
772759778	matthewzeinLE	2013-06-16 04:28:07	Baine is honestly the best villain ever. Hands down.
