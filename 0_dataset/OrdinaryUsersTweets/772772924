772772924	madiquiqley	2013-05-09 21:34:29	Can I live out of state.... Even for like a week. And leave my phone and everything behind.

772772924	madiquiqley	2013-10-29 05:56:23	I literally think about sleep all day. Then when it comes time to actually go to sleep. I'm either not tired or think to much that I can't.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-10-30 05:10:29	Why do I tend to think so much at night...

772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-06 05:37:49	I just love @Hannah_Woytek she's basically my role model. And we get closer everyday. I'm gonna cry when she leaves me. 😭👯🏀
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-07 00:37:06	Will we ever say the words we're feeling...
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-07 05:28:31	I'm just so pumped for basketball season. 😍🏀 let the memories begin.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-08 06:33:38	I was definitely born in the wrong time
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-10 22:27:07	Don't settle for your best, because your best can always be better.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-12 02:41:00	How do you describe a thought that you don't quite understand yourself
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-13 01:57:46	This bad boy will be my BFF for the next year. Woooo😏🎉 http://t.co/CxwfflPuQu
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-13 04:14:36	“@Aries_ht: #Aries won't stop thinking about something until it's resolved.” Just when I thought I was the only one.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-14 01:16:41	Congrats to my favorite older me for signing. 🏀😘👯 you'll do amazing things. @Hannah_Woytek NDNU represent 🙌 http://t.co/WKGjPSa5ZB

772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-20 23:04:48	Hannah time 🕓 all the time, not really sure how we constantly get along... But ya know 😏
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-22 17:19:48	“@Hannah_Woytek: Madi said I need to work on my social skills 😩😩😩” Hannah didn't include the just kidding part she has friends 😏
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-23 16:26:37	The hardest part is realizing that it's all just a memory
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-24 02:05:44	Hannah is currently giving me the silent treatment. What am I gonna do with my life 😣 @Hannah_Woytek just love me.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-24 02:18:33	“@Hannah_Woytek: I decided I don't like madi as much as I thought I did” wow I thought what we had was real. 💔 we had a truce.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-26 06:01:05	I mean Hannah is cute right? Hands down my fave person. Not quite sure what I'd do without her to be honest. 💕🙈 http://t.co/OvUiylF17p

772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-03 03:32:25	Taking off basketball shorts and putting on spandex to go to volleyball I feel like I have no clothes on.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-03 05:10:10	@Hannah_Woytek point proven. Meany head. 🙅
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-04 00:43:44	Just went to town on in n out
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-04 04:45:17	Gotta get the pre game playlist on point 🏀
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-29 15:11:18	I'd rather run 100 UCLA's then be awake right now
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-04 05:47:14	@Hannah_Woytek @AlliReviglio you catch on quickly we do what we want 😏 ~words of wisdom from my favorite person. 😘
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-30 23:28:59	Glad Alli doesn't know I'm in her house, so I'm laying on her bed while she sings in the shower. Creepin on my BFF.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-11-30 23:29:54	Curious as to when @maliaholt3 and I are gonna become vine famous?
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-01 20:53:55	I mean sorry guys but @AlliReviglio got a twitter and I was her first follower 😏
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-01 01:30:42	Hannah withdrawals, not knowing what to do with myself.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-01 17:39:37	Starting tomorrow I have no life.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-08 07:08:04	@Hannah_Woytek trust me I do ❤️ hey this is like an open bond now 😏 I showed you mine too so appreciate it 👌
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-08 07:32:35	Pretty sure I won because I got to watch you both eat it #h
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-08 03:01:33	My mom is having an "end life" crisis if you get the joke 😂 ohhhh Katie
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-08 06:55:57	"Which was really embarrassing because he was a nice guy" @Hannah_Woytek  never laughed so hard in one night *insert Katie's future twitter*
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-08 17:58:23	I wonder what it's like to not be sore
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-13 06:45:16	When you know what you want in life and you want it bad enough, motivation will help you. You'll find a way to get it.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-15 05:21:18	Not this time.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-19 05:25:35	I think ornaments get more sentimental every year. Because the memories are further away back in time, so you appreciate them more.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-19 05:27:53	@Hannah_Woytek 🙈 I'm speechless. I think I'll just call you the day maker? ❤️
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-20 14:31:50	I'm about to be the most grumpy person on this long day.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-20 15:36:51	For those people who already worked out at FAST this morning I applaud you.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-20 20:57:14	So I'm thinking no one should talk to me for another good 24 hours.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-21 04:24:08	@demipartyka is a pissed Christian. And the fact me @Hannah_Woytek @Katrinagrace9 are just having a blast in the back makes it all better. 🎉
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-24 05:57:27	@Hannah_Woytek deletes every picture I try to take of me and her.... Just love me.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-25 23:53:01	This game is way too close for comfort....
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-23 22:03:20	S/O to my girl @Hannah_Woytek for not getting beat up on the court today 😏😂👊
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-22 20:20:20	@AlliReviglio thought ice skating would be a good idea little does she know I struggle walking on the floor.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-28 08:04:59	Happy birthday to my one and only. Separation anxiety already. Wish I was with you. The big 18! Whoop whoop. Love you ❤️💕🎈 @Hannah_Woytek

772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-30 05:37:32	@Hannah_Woytek it was perfect 🙈💁
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-01 00:46:27	@Hannah_Woytek I lied. Coming back, seeing you, eating food. Nothing compares to that
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-01 01:59:39	The soon to be Hannah of 2014 has said she hates me. Oh and don't let me forget... She said my parents pay her to be my friend. #h
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-30 21:59:33	So much perfection in one picture. 🌊 http://t.co/cJvJQhfanl
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-30 19:34:19	You know you're a baller when you get rim checked. Good thing our boys looked good this morning. Got the W.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-30 19:46:48	@bryce_d_ this kid trying to show off on the other team 😂 got a little too fancy.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-28 03:45:32	Just left Hannah's house. Already miss her. This is about to be a long trip.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-01 21:42:12	Alli just informed me when I get back I have volleyball practice every day of the week. Alright stellar.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-31 01:49:38	So.... When can I see Hannah. I miss her so much.
772772924	madiquiqley	2013-12-31 19:33:09	Perfect day, perfect waves to surf.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-01 00:39:06	Nothing on this world better then it. 🌊🏄 http://t.co/bZYQIzrN5s
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-04 18:33:45	@Hannah_Woytek @AlliReviglio @emi_higgins oh I'm sure that smells sweet 😏👅 you love it. Reminds you of us 👏
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-05 02:52:04	"I let you win, no one likes a sore winner, don't get cocky son." 😂 @emi_higgins Emi he's like 3.... http://t.co/v1KtB6A8S1
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-06 06:16:55	Really glad @AlliReviglio is being the funniest person on the planet rn. Vine game on point.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-06 06:26:08	Didn't see Hannah today what is life?
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-07 05:37:33	@JKaley17 made everyone's night when he became a girl for a second. #fearbonding
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-04 05:32:25	Currently left the building because my hatred for @AlliReviglio @Hannah_Woytek and @emi_higgins grew too strong. ✌️
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-05 16:41:15	@rowe_chy11 yes 🙈😍 day just got that much better.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-04 20:38:25	I'm so lucky I've already found my life long bestfriend ❤️ @AlliReviglio
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-05 00:10:24	I just don't ever want to let anyone down.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-08 08:56:41	The days aren't long enough for all the thoughts that I want to think.... So my mind just wanders.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-08 09:09:18	Does distance determine anything pertaining to friendship? If you wanna be around a friend you love aren't you already there somehow?
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-08 20:10:15	@Hannah_Woytek @Brandon_Kernan wow who took this amazing picture? Must be someone amazing. You. Are. Welcome.

772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-13 00:44:58	Neither of you are funny in any way
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-10 21:40:21	I forgot how much I absolutely hate hospitals.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-12 21:11:41	Let's get it bolts. 💛💙⚡️
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-12 21:26:02	I wonder if Hannah realizes I won't be talking to her a good couple hours if the chargers lose. 😅💁
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-12 21:27:47	@korbin_marcum4 looks like my boys better come thru... And they will 😊 may the odds be ever in your favor 💁 (they won't be)
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-13 08:05:35	Happy birthday to my bestfriend ❤️ love you girl today will be the best 🎈 @AlliReviglio
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-19 05:10:13	I don't understand how any boys would like me... Or why they would be upset that we broke up 😂wise words from @Ali_French_
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-19 07:32:12	Id just like to thank my jackpot win of tickets for getting me the best possession I've ever owned. Stay swag. http://t.co/aZaWVD48hn
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-21 06:30:29	@mr_main52 @AlliReviglio Alli remind me why you're my bestfriend? 😂 max don't listen. I'm gonna tell everyone to be there.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-21 06:59:54	Hannah used the terms "k" and "I hate you" in one message. Might as well just tell me to jump off a cliff or something. Goodness. #h
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-22 17:47:20	“@joshprizina: I could care less about Madi. Blake looks cute in the background. @madiquiqley @KawikaKaanoi http://t.co/7xjJXpDju7” truuu

772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-22 07:20:38	I don't think sleep is even a thing anymore, as if I forgot how to sleep. Or my body and mind just won't allow it.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-23 07:43:01	We only run from the things that truly scare us
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-25 07:56:15	I hate change and not knowing what's ahead of me.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-31 15:34:05	Still think the people who have already worked out at fast this morning are insane.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-30 06:32:51	Everyone tries to make something they don't fully understand go away... But how do you kill a feeling?
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-30 06:38:02	@mateolemus21 how about you just shoot the feeling for me. Ps thanks for killing the sentimental meaning behind my tweet.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-02-02 01:58:25	On a scale of one to punching a wall... I am currently at a let me break my fist on 800 million bricks.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-01-30 20:29:18	Apparently older women dig @dzz__nots

772772924	madiquiqley	2014-02-06 06:06:25	@Hannah_Woytek and if you post another picture without giving me photo credit..... It won't be pretty. Here let me phtocred: @madiquiqley
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-02-06 07:01:50	I wonder what it feels like to be like @dzz__nots and only follow 52 people. What's a tru homie gotta do to get that follow?
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-02-06 07:35:03	@dzz__nots what do I gotta do? Done, only if we have code names like this and look as fly as my main shown below. http://t.co/xvPB9B0Qrw
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-02-07 22:59:16	The thought of senior night is just really sad and scary.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-02-11 06:25:31	You think everything can only get better from your lowest point... But how naive, because things can get even worse before they get better.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-02-11 06:27:23	Perks of being injured... Oh wait. There is none.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-02-16 05:10:25	Impatiently overwhelmed by not being able to do anything.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-02-19 05:42:29	Hannah went off tonight I'm so glad I've got to play with you, and have gotten close with you. Ball out. 🏀@Hannah_Woytek
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-02-17 05:17:13	It may or may not occur.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-02-17 07:19:10	It's nice knowing that I'll always have one person who will be honest with me, I can count on them, and stand up for me. I got lucky.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-02-20 05:43:20	Glad @Hannah_Woytek parents and mine are out later then we are... I guess when you're BFF's so are your parents?
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-02-20 05:44:17	@Hannah_Woytek 😂 is your dad third wheeling it then? 👏
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-02-21 06:25:03	Just an all around horrible feeling.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-02-21 07:24:44	I am so proud of you, getting to play with my role model was my most cherished memory. I'll miss it. Good season💜🏀 http://t.co/Lgey5A38zE

772772924	madiquiqley	2014-03-13 04:50:44	Get home and doors locked, maybe because my parents are still out with Hannah's. Glad they have lives.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-03-15 07:30:34	@Hannah_Woytek wouldn't want it any other way. 😘😘

772772924	madiquiqley	2014-06-01 02:44:44	Tate Bauserman:"I say you just go to his house and kiss him." Words from a 4th grader that's how we do 💩 in the Bauserman family.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-05-30 22:08:37	Steps of a sunburn:

772772924	madiquiqley	2014-08-16 03:08:00	Let's all be realistic and bring our school spirit TOGETHER to our football games. And be competitive against the other schools!

772772924	madiquiqley	2014-08-17 18:13:42	I wonder what justifies in people's minds to judge others based off of association. Everyone is capable of making their own decisions.

772772924	madiquiqley	2014-08-18 00:49:12	Find a friend with clarity and don't let them go.
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-08-22 03:36:11	If the only person allowed to judge you was yourself; what would you think of that person? That's what matters.

772772924	madiquiqley	2014-12-15 05:34:36	Have you ever just known what you wanted to do everyday because you loved it? And wondered where that passion for it came from?
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-12-15 06:21:06	Twitter could be the best thing ever, if we used it to our advantage with deep life thoughts, aspirations, insights on the world and goals
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-12-15 06:43:19	Love when people say "you put words to something I thought but didn't know how to say" because we all can try to grasp our own thoughts...
772772924	madiquiqley	2014-12-20 09:39:18	The most intriguing thing is that most of us look to music for answers... And I want to partake in those answers more then anything else.

772772924	madiquiqley	2015-01-06 21:12:49	In my opinion the best conversations are unforced about things you're passionate about to see another perspective of your thoughts.
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-01-07 18:23:07	@Hannah_Woytek was going to make my sister wake me up to talk to me. Bestfriend goals.

772772924	madiquiqley	2015-01-10 20:18:38	We all should create our own judgements of people without anyone else's history creating a pre-judgement for us.
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-01-10 22:19:44	Really in the mood for a trip to Tahoe or downtown Reno and see some beautiful things things town has to offer.
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-01-12 00:01:00	How do you speak words without having any meaning to them?
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-01-12 03:16:08	Maybe if we could take a journey through each other's minds and find hidden emotions occurring we would appreciate each other much more.
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-01-13 03:29:11	Learning to not make assumptions of people you don't know, should be a wise lesson everyone should try and learn.
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-01-14 06:21:51	Someone who tries to understand the complexity of a mind makes me strive to figure out the purpose behind it. http://t.co/wiGhE7hfaH
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-01-20 07:39:37	It's crazy that we can go through the day and not know if something is wrong with someone because we've become masters at hiding it.

772772924	madiquiqley	2015-05-01 03:16:10	My mind thinks in chapters, how I wish to spill my thoughts on paper to make a difference.

772772924	madiquiqley	2015-05-11 04:40:56	Everything you need is within yourself. Appreciate diversity. #OneLoveOneHeart #YouMatter

772772924	madiquiqley	2015-05-11 04:47:36	@sarahakhtarrr thank you :') you are beautiful inside and out. I enjoy you very much
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-05-11 04:55:57	Everything around us. Words. Social media is controlled by us. Let's use it positively. Lead the way. #OneLoveOneHeart #YouMatter
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-05-11 05:08:58	@trevzilla09 I like to believe that this was created for something different then we are about to make it. Power to the people.
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-05-11 05:15:31	The power of influence is insane, use this to drive you to inspire others and yourself constantly. Nevada and further. #OneLoveOneHeart
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-05-11 05:24:59	Our generation is full of "doers" sometimes we need a little push in the right direction. We dream and do, don't second guess that.
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-05-11 05:29:50	We put a definition to our life, and can change it at anytime. Same difference with media as a whole. How do you let it define you?
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-05-11 05:47:39	@sshsnice @TkaniFinau @Cach_Zarrubba it isn't about who starts it it's about who continues it and guides more people. Love everyone ❤️
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-05-11 06:25:40	@Tai_kinsie @Christian_CCE it's perception. Misconception. One persons right is another's wrong. It's a blurred area, but idealized views.
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-05-12 22:34:33	It starts somewhere: http://t.co/tFW25YWWfg

772772924	madiquiqley	2015-05-27 00:21:52	When you look at the clouds and see something different than the human standing next to you, learn that OUR eyes see OUR own world.

772772924	madiquiqley	2015-06-04 23:34:09	Maybe we are all treasure chests, each possibility is a map leading us one step closer to finding ourselves. What happens when you get lost?

772772924	madiquiqley	2015-06-09 04:09:10	@trevzilla09 sometimes sound swims softly sailing so smooth simmering smiling sifting swapping shockingly stopping slightly sealed shut?
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-06-10 05:06:17	The older you get the less inclined you are to deal with the pressure the world brings, weighing you down. You put meaning to your life.
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-06-10 05:08:32	Why do we stress over things we can ignore?
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-06-10 05:10:23	"You only HAVE to die." 
Death is inevitable, but think about it maybe only your outer self dies. Not your soul we don't HAVE to do anything
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-06-10 05:11:07	@NoBootty weird right.
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-06-16 04:11:13	How can you be fulfilled with adolescence when you've lived an infinite amount of years?
772772924	madiquiqley	2015-06-18 04:30:46	My dad and my dog both got mohawks, does this mean I'm next?
