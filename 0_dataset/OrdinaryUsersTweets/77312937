77312937	freddie002	2011-08-30 11:47:15	@xoJakox blimey that's not good. Is a 2nd opinion worth a go? Hope its not something that's going to be a constant thing.

77312937	freddie002	2012-07-15 19:38:46	@thedavidhunter as a voter and viewer my tip is always sing a well known song. If people can't relate or sing along then they won't vote.
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-15 20:21:50	Becky has done herself no favours tonight. Get her out! #bbuk

77312937	freddie002	2012-07-25 08:58:32	@danielboys blimey this tweet took me back to "make some noise for Daniel boys" blast from the past lol
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-25 09:21:06	@GaryLineker obviously thought he is bigger than the Olympics. Silly silly boy!
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-20 11:10:03	@AlyssaJewellery have emailed re an order. Please don't kill me. I'm so  undecisive lol
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-20 17:04:51	@AlyssaJewellery does the clover bracelet come in other colour pearls?
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-21 07:17:46	@AlyssaJewellery happy birthday. Thanks for making people all sparkly lol. Have a lovely day x
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-21 09:29:47	oops another 2 pieces of @AlyssaJewellery will be coming my way. Not sure how that happened lol.  Cant wait.
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-25 20:28:54	@shelleydclarke yes that's why he is leaving radio show. Just can't see him in it lol
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-25 20:31:32	@shelleydclarke it looks shaky. Perhaps the crew have been celebrating already lol
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-25 21:36:16	@shelleydclarke be quick its only on for 2 nights at the O2. Not much time to rehearse.
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-25 20:22:46	@shelleydclarke who do you want to win? Think the show would be great to see
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-25 20:25:49	@shelleydclarke David is my favourite but can see Ben in role too. Interested to see what Chris moyles will be like. You getting tickets?
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-25 21:16:54	@shelleydclarke its at the 02?
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-25 21:45:52	@Emma_Willis Caroline must be the rudest housemate we have had for ages! She should be ashamed of herself. She is rough rough rough! Evict!
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-25 22:05:10	@Emma_Willis bet its strange watching someone else be you on bit on the side.
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-27 21:15:09	@shelleydclarke I don't understand what is going on lol.
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-27 21:23:35	@Emma_Willis totally deserved tho. She has no manners or social skills.
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-27 07:08:59	@AlyssaJewellery but look at the lack of quality. Even the chain is twisted in photo. Not a patch on anything you do! Don't worry x
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-27 21:17:41	@shelleydclarke on and off. I'm not sure how it all represents the Olympics but I'm sure it does! On a bit too long for me. Good music mix.
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-27 21:22:37	@shelleydclarke no very naughty of me but turned over to see who got chucked out of BB. Don't tell anyone lol
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-08 18:11:30	@AlyssaJewellery are they heavy or can be worn all day?
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-30 18:44:02	@67rainey hey at least challenge titchmarsh for a place on love your garden!
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-30 18:54:54	@TomDaley1994 your dad will be shining bright with pride for you and not just for today but forever. x
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-30 20:15:54	@Zoe1858 afraid not. Sorry
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-31 21:29:13	@jonsavage03 totally. Was really worried when he came in but really taken to him. Feels like its always been his role
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-30 18:33:25	@67rainey attractive trelis lol http://t.co/6mBL9z9D
77312937	freddie002	2012-07-30 19:01:49	@Zoe1858 anything I can do to put you back together?
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-09 17:15:24	Why is it always the people you love the most that hurt you the most and don't think twice about doing it?
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-01 15:54:36	@IcedrainbowFanz @AlyssaJewellery No the difference is quality. the "real tweetie" has quality and that speaks volumes.
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-03 17:18:14	@WoodKellie well hello Kellie. You are certainly a modern girl now!

77312937	freddie002	2012-08-05 10:54:27	@67rainey @AlyssaJewellery I am well tempted too! Should we??
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-05 11:02:58	@67rainey @AlyssaJewellery your patience over I don't know how many years for a patio is like training for the Olympics. You will deserve 1
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-04 21:55:31	@AlyssaJewellery stop making things I want lol. This is beautiful and would go with everything.
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-05 20:29:32	@RobbieSavage8 what ever gave me the most money!
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-05 04:44:03	"@AlyssaJewellery: 'ENNIS' - http://t.co/Fm94PU7m" @67rainey  as you are the Olympic oracle this is right up your street!

77312937	freddie002	2012-08-11 19:12:08	@WoodKellie oh I'm sure that won't be for a long time yet x
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-11 19:19:44	@WoodKellie that way you get longer to train and win gold!
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-11 21:08:52	@TomDaley1994 well done. So pleased for you. X
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-11 21:26:26	@jonsavage03 can't I choose Tom Daley? He is a sweetie.
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-11 22:55:22	@officialkeith where you been?

77312937	freddie002	2012-08-07 14:50:59	Starving hungry and having a rubbish day!
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-12 09:35:00	@Iwanrunner was getting worried that there was no coverage. Thought it started Monday.

77312937	freddie002	2012-08-12 22:25:30	@BFairthorne had forgotten about that mistake lol
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-12 22:53:46	@GBarlowOfficial you are a true professional. After your sad news you still put on a show. you deserve a gold medal. X
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-12 23:00:43	Gary Barlow what a star. How hard must that have been? He is a strong strong man.
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-12 23:06:26	@WoodKellie so felt for him. On a different note are you going to put a pic on. Doesn't seem right you being an egg lol
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-16 10:27:25	@JeffroBrazier totally. You loose how to have a real conversation and don't get out to see real people!
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-17 21:46:57	@shelleydclarke jasmine is a total cow. She gives it the big I am and I don't care etc and then cries when nominated. She must go!
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-17 18:00:26	@chantellehought I would say give up, go to someone you trust and ask other salon to pay for it. Hair is too important to muck up.
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-17 19:44:49	@mermhart who cares if repeat, they have me in stitches no matter how many times I watch them. Also Mr Ellis is a sight for sore eyes!
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-22 19:13:17	@KirstieMAllsopp think prince Harry probably loves it. He is just a fun loving bloke. Love that he is just like everyone else.
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-20 15:00:59	How hard can it be to get a doctors appointment. I phone at 12 told call after 3. I call at 3.10 appts all gone!!
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-20 17:04:36	@67rainey how's Ben shoulder? X

77312937	freddie002	2012-08-17 07:28:01	@WoodKellie happy birthday Max. Have a wonderful day xxx
77312937	freddie002	2012-08-26 21:08:13	@JeffroBrazier tell them just to smile sweetly and punters will be putty in their hands. Good luck boys.

77312937	freddie002	2012-08-24 17:45:03	People at the top of mangement have no common sense. As they are climbing the ladder their common sense must drip out of their arses!

77312937	freddie002	2012-09-22 08:13:28	@JohnTorode1 just finished watching. You made correct choice. A deserved winner!
77312937	freddie002	2012-09-26 10:49:47	I'm trying very hard to have patience with my parents today.
77312937	freddie002	2012-09-23 08:55:14	Dear god just incase you have twitter, please let my dad be well today and be my dad again. Thank you very very much.
77312937	freddie002	2012-09-26 19:39:11	Waited so long to go on holiday and now don't want to go and leave dad! Argh.
77312937	freddie002	2012-10-10 10:28:43	@Schofe thank you. Have had so many PPI spam texts. Have just forwarded them all. Worth watching just for that info lol
77312937	freddie002	2012-10-07 22:28:34	Fab holiday but looking forward to seeing my dad tomorrow. Hope he is on the mend properly and not just saying it for my benefit!

77312937	freddie002	2012-10-08 19:59:17	@Mario_Falcone why don't you take the time to house train her?! Not exactly hygenic to have her weeing indoors is it?
77312937	freddie002	2012-10-08 21:06:02	Wow just watched piers Morgan and @ronanofficial. So emotional and made me realise what and who is important and once gone its too late.
77312937	freddie002	2012-10-13 17:43:46	Fancy Nicky like mad but he so can't dance. Looked awkward and dated. Nicky just stand there and smile aka jerry hall lol #SCD
77312937	freddie002	2012-10-16 05:22:55	@ronanofficial watch episode 2. The most tense episode ever I think. Can't believe its only episode 2 felt like end of series cliff hanger!
77312937	freddie002	2012-10-16 05:26:37	@KirstieMAllsopp felt more like a series end cliff hanger than a 2nd episode. How on earth will he wriggle out of that tape confession??
77312937	freddie002	2012-10-16 05:27:37	@mermhart don't you mean such fun! Lol

77312937	freddie002	2012-10-16 19:19:32	10/10 No they said it had caught on the edge. 9/10 Brendan get with it!
77312937	freddie002	2012-10-16 19:54:45	@GaryLineker you perving at Mr Lee Dixon too? Lol
77312937	freddie002	2012-10-17 21:51:07	@lucy_meck did you ever really get engaged or was it just for the show? I'd be devastated if someone was like "were not engaged anymore".
77312937	freddie002	2012-10-18 10:38:37	@micky_norcross they are just jealous. Fame has gone to their heads. You have got where you are today by yourself, not by a TV show. #PMA
77312937	freddie002	2012-10-26 17:23:12	Please Mr administrator split my trust up on Monday. Then I won't have to work with  these knob heads anymore!

77312937	freddie002	2012-10-21 19:52:48	@JohnTorode1 will the tape contain the whole confession. Will Saul pass on what he knows? Too many questions and only episode 3!

77312937	freddie002	2013-02-03 16:38:31	Argh why do I bother.  When will I learn not to care about people that obviously cant be bothered with me? Makes me feel rubbish.
77312937	freddie002	2013-02-03 16:48:58	@Zoe1858 why do I always do it though? Im not stupid but keep hoping things will change and ill become important to them. I give up lol

77312937	freddie002	2013-11-03 19:43:09	@Lord_Sugar totally. If public dont warm to you you will never win. Her pouty wag persona goes before her dancing im afraid.
77312937	freddie002	2013-11-03 19:54:13	@Lord_Sugar they vote for who they like regardless of the dance ability. Public will always vote with their hearts not their heads.

77312937	freddie002	2013-12-01 21:27:52	Tough week starts tomorrow.
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-01 19:01:45	Need a little hug and a pick me up.
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-06 13:10:52	So deflated today. Think its worse to be screwed over by someone you know and confide in.  :(
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-09 19:55:58	@Zoe1858 you having a bad bad day?
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-09 19:59:57	@Zoe1858 oh no. It can only get better?? Bloody life lol
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-09 21:08:11	@Zoe1858 anything I can help with?
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-09 22:14:25	@Zoe1858 feel yr pain Im getting shafted by someone id class as a friend and colleague.  Have you time off over xmas for rock to settle him?
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-08 10:39:32	Miss not going to panto this year.
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-07 17:47:04	In such a foul mood. I dont want to live with me today!
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-10 08:30:20	@Zoe1858 yes me too :-(  oh thats a lovely break.  Good luck today with trainer.  You and rocks will get there.  Dont give up xx
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-10 08:43:55	@Zoe1858 have faith. He will get it. Its like potty training, one day it just clicks.  You can do it Zoe.
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-10 09:13:20	Something is wrong. Have had 2 birthday presents in my lounge for 3 days and not prodded them once.  Please dont say im growing up :-(
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-10 15:27:17	Argh throat is sore all down one side :-(
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-10 19:59:39	@Zoe1858 how was the trainer today?  Any good tips?
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-10 20:49:52	@Zoe1858 we had a dominant dog but once we never let it walk into a room before us she started to see us as her leader rather than her.
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-10 20:50:48	@Zoe1858 hopefully with your time off over xmas you can tackle toilet training. It just needs someone there all day for a while.
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-10 20:58:07	@Zoe1858 it takes a while and it is exhausting to keep walking them out and making them sit till you go through.  Dominate dogs are so hard.
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-10 20:59:02	@Zoe1858 and it never stops as they keep challenging you. We stopped treats as we wanted her to do it cos we said not for a treat.
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-10 21:00:19	@Zoe1858 we just had to get her to respect us as the leader. Once you can devote time to toilet training all day and every day it will be ok
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-10 21:32:46	@67rainey not a sore throat.  Just felt 2 ulcers on roof of mouth to 1 side at the back. Soreness must be inflammation. No antibiotics reqd
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-11 09:09:24	@67rainey thank you and thank you for trying for tweets xxx

77312937	freddie002	2013-12-29 22:28:38	Sometimes you just need a helping hand when you fall. Hard part is knowing the right hand to grasp!
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-30 11:29:34	1 scan down 1 to go. Keeping everything crossed 2014 is not surgery year but am worried as feel different!
77312937	freddie002	2013-12-27 19:28:58	Doesnt matter if you love someone with every inch of your body, you cant make them feel the same. They have to care about u in the 1st place

77312937	freddie002	2014-01-02 19:56:41	Secrets/lies never work they only hurt.  Be honest, even if the truth isnt what people want to hear. Be true to yourself and your upbringing
77312937	freddie002	2014-01-03 19:49:18	When the person you have loved and respected lets you down yet again and doesnt give you a 2nd thought its time to take a big step back.
77312937	freddie002	2014-01-03 20:41:07	@Zoe1858 I am!  Im such a loyal friend and if they cant cherish that then ill take it elsewhere :-)

77312937	freddie002	2014-01-08 22:18:00	Some days you just need a cup of tea and a hug.

77312937	freddie002	2014-06-13 13:03:21	@michelrouxjr @GreggAWallace @MGaletti01 @Marcuswareing will not be the same without you. Always told the truth in a nice way. Never nasty.
77312937	freddie002	2014-06-13 15:53:10	@danjohnson78 have you been on my extra strength pain killers?
77312937	freddie002	2014-06-13 15:58:22	@danjohnson78 I even did a little hand dance.

77312937	freddie002	2014-06-11 06:56:47	@danjohnson78 im just going to blame Pete the spreadsheet man. An indirect link that will still lead to you.
77312937	freddie002	2014-06-11 06:57:23	@danjohnson78 they might think you kill all your office buds lol

  http://t.co/TJ1K6m1uPB"
77312937	freddie002	2014-06-15 14:12:03	@TheBlowfish is it true that big crocodiles can go 6 months without food?
77312937	freddie002	2014-06-15 14:17:01	@TheBlowfish blimey I cant go 6 hours without food lol. Thanks didnt believe the man on tele. He seems a bit wishy washy although nice.
77312937	freddie002	2014-06-15 14:41:59	@TheBlowfish he is steve backshaw I think. Its on bbc1 about giant animals. Just feels like he is reading from a script instead of knowing.
77312937	freddie002	2014-06-15 15:42:39	@TheBlowfish knew it.  When you explain your passionate about the subject. He was boring and not trustworthy. Hence I ask you lol
77312937	freddie002	2014-06-15 15:44:18	@BBCOne you need @TheBlowfish for your nature programmes.  He is so informative and passionate. Get him on and your ratings will fly.
77312937	freddie002	2014-06-19 18:00:30	Need a flipping good night out and a bottle of bubbles.
77312937	freddie002	2014-06-19 10:51:09	Amazing what you find out about someone by talking to a different colleague.  Secrets never stay secrets.
77312937	freddie002	2014-06-19 16:24:26	When your given an opportunity to come clean always take it.  #goodadvice

77312937	freddie002	2014-06-22 20:55:24	@shelleydclarke cant stand toya. She needs to take a look at herself.
77312937	freddie002	2014-06-22 21:16:08	@shelleydclarke as a certain old housemate would say "Who is she? "
77312937	freddie002	2014-06-25 07:20:58	Sooooo tired lately.   Feel like I cant recharge my batteries.

77312937	freddie002	2014-06-29 08:20:09	@Zoe1858 unless its from the lottery headquarters to say your a millionaire then its just wrong.
77312937	freddie002	2014-06-29 09:19:40	@AlanCarr be a devil and have both.

77312937	freddie002	2014-07-20 09:51:16	@Teresa_Maxwell @RockChoir best day ever. Even in the heat it was amazing.
77312937	freddie002	2014-07-20 18:09:50	I need to go on catchphrase.  Im on fire today lol
77312937	freddie002	2014-07-22 12:36:27	Would be so nice if 1 day someone had my back and made an effort for me, just me.
77312937	freddie002	2014-07-26 21:00:05	Oh no think ill wake up with a bad head tomorrow.  So worth it tho. Such a giggle.

77312937	freddie002	2014-08-15 09:01:57	No gym this week only swimming.  Feel very lethargic.
77312937	freddie002	2014-08-17 20:20:30	@Zoe1858 cos your the adult in the family lol
77312937	freddie002	2014-08-17 20:41:41	@Zoe1858 us adults dont get a choice. Its the role your given! It will come good x
77312937	freddie002	2014-08-17 21:18:20	@Zoe1858 it either sorts itself out or you learn to not get involved and stay sat on the fence. Took me a while but im happier now I let go
77312937	freddie002	2014-08-17 21:23:01	@alex_brooker just watched this weeks last leg. You crack me up.  Love your chubaka roar #thelastleg

77312937	freddie002	2014-08-25 14:17:04	The bad thing about a rainy bank holiday is all I have done is watched tele and eaten bad stuff. Oops sorry diet
77312937	freddie002	2014-08-25 11:32:13	Lazy pj day today I think. Only pressing issue is what to have for lunch and dinner.
77312937	freddie002	2014-08-25 19:58:39	Having an extra day off work was fab but going back tomorrow will be hard. Really don't want to go. #workgetsintheway
77312937	freddie002	2014-08-27 20:07:18	What a week. Just want to get to the weekend in 1 piece lol

77312937	freddie002	2014-09-09 19:54:29	3 mile walk done. Good practice for charity walk Saturday night. Surprising how satisfying a good walk is.

77312937	freddie002	2014-09-24 12:20:48	Love holiday life, thinking I could stay here and be someone totally different forever. Only thing is I think I'd miss being me!
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-26 19:58:03	@officialkeith I have 3 months till the dreaded big number birthday. When can we start knocking years off our real age?
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-27 20:28:58	@mattgoss happy birthday.  Have a fab night. See you at the pallidium in Jan.
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-27 22:24:28	This seems to happen every night lol http://t.co/FTZHZTNISZ
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-26 06:58:46	Can't believe it's been a year since I last heard your big laugh and saw that cheeky smile of yours. Miss you uncle John so much. X
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-26 09:28:34	Just love a day off work. Work is so overrated and gets in the way of life!
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-28 06:35:33	@Zoe1858 I hope so.  Have physio in Orpington first. Hopefully quick session so I might get changed there and if traffic ok ill make it.
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-28 06:36:33	@Zoe1858 I need to so get back on it. Not done any real exercise for 2 weeks. Being on holiday has made me real lazy and I feel like a slob.
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-28 06:37:11	@Zoe1858 oops ok?
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-28 06:39:04	@SundayBrunchC4 @sally_lindsay @ActualBenMiller @GorgonCity @timlovejoy @simonrim @Channel4 is the @TheBlowfish not on today???
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-28 08:55:55	@Zoe1858 saw the pilates class and would like to do it but it  makes getting home and eating so late. I never seem to spend any time at home
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-28 08:57:34	@Zoe1858 I want to do something different.  Might get a trainer down the gym for my gym sessions and concentrate on weights to help tone up
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-28 09:00:21	@Zoe1858 I can't be that flexible with my lunch with meetings etc. It's crazy I have a house where I actually only spend about 2 evenings in
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-28 09:01:38	@Zoe1858 think that's what I'll do. I'll talk to someone next week. Just getting a bit bored and need a good push to up my workout.
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-28 09:06:45	@TheBlowfish @AnimalChris have you seen the clip where a chameleon treads on coloured glasses and changes to those colours. Is this true?
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-28 09:08:46	@Zoe1858 by Xmas I want to be 2 dress size smaller.  Let's see if it happens lol. Thinking of possibly seeing if I can find somewhere to box
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-28 16:13:06	@Zoe1858 fake tan will cover them. Have to wear a dress at your own party lol
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-28 16:14:25	@shelleydclarke actually shed a tear when read the article.  Makes me count my blessings and the ones I love blessings.
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-28 16:41:54	@Zoe1858 once that comes you will be in full party mode. How long till oz?
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-28 18:23:55	@Zoe1858 very very nice. How long you away for?
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-30 05:41:59	@Zoe1858 snap. I took painkillers and antihistamines that make you drowsy and it helped. You can't be ill for party.
77312937	freddie002	2014-09-29 20:11:50	@BritishBakeOff cake for my mum's birthday. My god what a mess I made in my kitchen tho lol http://t.co/w5OVX92nYH
