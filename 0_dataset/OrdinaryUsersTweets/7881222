7881222	warwicklibrary	2015-06-18 15:07:07	Though I wouldn't mind being in Berlin, where it's one degree warmer and one hour later - my home time!
7881222	warwicklibrary	2015-06-19 08:09:01	Good morning everyone, Julie here. I was hoping to have the sun riding shotgun, but it seems to have decided to stay in bed. #slacker

7881222	warwicklibrary	2015-06-19 09:05:31	@MarkNeilson @MJRgrs Is it the Koan-worshipping or the dressing up that's most appealing?!
7881222	warwicklibrary	2015-06-19 09:14:40	@iohn I hope you're somewhere exciting instead (and not just stuck in a traffic jam on Gibbet Hill Road).
