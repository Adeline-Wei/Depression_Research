81245318	Crawfornication	2014-04-27 15:13:19	the @BlueJays should just give a #bobblehead to everyone and avoid this line up early BS
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-04-28 23:16:04	So close I can taste it
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-02 03:55:40	My fuckin boy @PKSubban1 comes thru for the good guys tonight #gohabsgo #CanadaCanadiens

81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-09 02:42:51	the @steelers D loves fresh meat #DraftDay #JohnnyFootball
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-09 02:59:04	cant stand Ray Lewis, back to @nflnetwork
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-08 21:13:02	Big sports day, shot an 80 for the first round of the year. Now Habs vs. Bruins and #NFLDraft
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 02:08:43	#TreMason to the #rams .... Why not? #draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 02:11:12	#niners continue to load talent #draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 02:14:43	#rams are taking this #2014draft like I thought they would
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 02:17:23	#ravens only caring about Defense right now ....makes sense I guess #draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 02:22:58	#SteelersDraft lets grab #Nix while he's falling
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 02:28:41	watch out for the #texans D line #draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 03:13:41	don't even know what to make of this pick but the @steelers needed a WR, fastest guy in the @2014draft #SteelersDraft #SteelersNation
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-09 23:22:24	pretty obvious pick coming up for the #browns #MarquiseLee
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-09 23:25:15	#Browns stick to their needs, regardless of what happened today #KushGordon
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-09 23:30:32	great value for the #Raiders without having to move or give up anything #DraftDay2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-08 22:27:20	No idea what the @steelers are going to do tonight. OT, DT, CB, or WR #steelersdraft #draftday
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-08 22:41:11	Anyone else noticing that hardly any of these players on the red carpet have the same last name as their moms? #draftday
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-09 23:33:32	i like the #Falcons to take #hageman
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-09 23:41:51	#bucs basically redoing the offense
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-09 23:45:57	#Jags go offense again, making improvements with #lee
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-09 23:48:51	#lions HAVE to go defense with this pick, but most likely a WR #Draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-09 23:53:58	finally #Lions make a better pick that makes sense
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 00:00:10	this #Rams team is going to be scary good in a couple years.Wait, what division do they play in? #draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 00:01:10	trades are coming at Paul Walker speed #DraftDay2014
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 00:03:00	#Eagles just replaced #Djax
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 00:08:18	tremendous quality pick for the #bills #draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 00:11:03	Building a nice little offense in #buffalo #Draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 00:17:42	figured #Seahawks would be taking WR
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 00:19:52	definitely best value pick for #steelernation, welcome #tuitt
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 00:23:48	surprised #ravens didn't take #Hyde to replace the wifebeater, still quality pick #draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 00:28:03	I don't really care of the cost @steelers need to trade back into the 2nd or 3rd round and take a CB or WR #SteelersDraft #draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 00:30:10	Really? you mean the #jets took an offensive player #bouttime #draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 00:37:24	#NFLDraft2014 is the best example of the direction the league is going....No RB's have been drafted yet. It was a weak class, but still
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 00:47:25	Boooom, #1stRB off the board #recordpick #letsgetsankey #titans #Draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 00:55:00	interesting pick the #bungals another RB? Gio gets a partner again
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 00:57:02	of course #broncos add another wideout. Doesn't matter who Payton throws to, #instantstud #draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 01:02:53	favourite part of the #NFLDraft is watching GMs/teams work the board @theMMQB
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 01:03:58	oh no, another RB talent in #SanFran. Gore's days are numbered #draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 01:13:28	#colts take a very versatile O linemen with their first pick
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 01:16:27	tremendous value in the #kony pick for the #Panthers. No way they were taking back2back WR #Draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 01:18:07	I knew the #niners would be trading all over the place tonight #Draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 01:19:12	surprisingly the #Jags are staking talent at WR for their new QB
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 01:21:03	@jaguars receivers are scary good, just have to deliver #draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 01:24:20	THERE IT IS. #Pats draft a QB #draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 01:27:32	#patriots still haven't really helped their team thru 2 rounds @draftday2
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-09 00:33:41	3 smart picks to start the draft, suprisingly no trades thus far #DraftDay
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 19:36:30	Finally @steelers draft OT #DraftDay3
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-10 23:19:36	guaranteed that gay kiss on ESPN is going to set off a fire storm of hate south of the boarder #gooddayforfootball #Draftday3 #SamsaRam
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-15 01:32:10	Think I'm going to puke #GoHabsGo

81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-17 02:23:16	#Ducksaredinner @LAKings are the craziest playoff team
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-17 21:06:26	I partly blame the NBC timeslot for the disappointment #GoHabsGo #Nexttime
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-17 02:24:19	You can't roll your goalies and expect to win in the #NHLplayoffs
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-23 01:32:20	Make a fuckin breakout pass boys #GoHabsGo #tape2tape
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-05-26 01:25:34	Big goal #GoHabsGo

81245318	Crawfornication	2014-06-26 14:25:18	The new #SIwebsite is absolutely horrible. No organization, its a mess. I think im done with them except for #mmqb and #swimsuitissue
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-06-26 17:47:11	Thanks Nike and @HockeyCanada for slowly ruining the best jersey in sports.
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-06-26 17:49:38	Red, White, and a little black with a big maple leaf on the front... its pretty simple @HockeyCanada  new jerseys are brutal

81245318	Crawfornication	2014-06-28 00:59:36	Why is it that not one website covering the #NHLDraft has a best available ticker with live updates? #TSN #ESPN #nhl.com
81245318	Crawfornication	2014-06-28 01:33:37	Did they stop playing hockey in Quebec or something? #NHLDraft

81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-01 01:58:07	Damn, one less good corner on the board for my @steelers to draft. Looking like another linebacker #SteelersDraft #SteelerNation
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-01 02:12:54	Chip Kelly is going to draft a kicker #NFLDraft
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-01 02:15:51	Dupree, Ray, or maybe even Gregory? to the @steelers #SteelersDraft #NFLDraft
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-01 02:17:48	Two boring but smart picks on the lines for the #Browns tonight. But it's still the Browns #NFLDraft
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-01 02:24:49	Remember when the #NFLDraft was all about left tackles and defensive ends
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-01 02:27:48	Perfect, @steelers need a corner but we can't pass on #BudDupree too much value #SteelersDraft #SteelerNation
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-01 03:32:26	I think the #NFLDraft was set to autodraft tonight with about 10 GMs participating
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-02 19:33:39	Way to be @MikeDavisRB on becoming a niner and a member of the NFL #NFLDraft #GOCOCKS
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-03 03:34:06	Ya'll must of forgot #Royjones
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-07 01:22:32	All effort there boy #GoHabsGo
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-10 21:42:05	WOW! Ricky Fowler just torched the back 9 at the #PlayersChampionship #byebyeSergio
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-12 00:15:06	Once again we get validation of why that prick #Goodell shouldn't be in charge of the NFL #DeflateGate
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-12 03:04:32	Time to start throwing rotten vegetables at #Goodell next #NFLDraft #DeflateGate
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-12 10:54:51	Can @CP24 at least get the #DeflateGate story correct? It wasn't in the Super Bowl
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-15 03:06:24	Pretty sure that the movie #YesMan is based on my life
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-16 03:51:14	I think I've watched 15 min of the #NBAPlayoffs since the @Raptors were eliminated #basketballsucks #NHLPlayoffs are the best
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-21 00:09:34	Every coach in hockey owes #Babcock an expensive bottle of wine after today
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-27 13:58:01	Finally these pieces of shit are getting exposed #FuckFIFA
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-30 00:23:33	After hearing the Prince Shembo story, all I can think about is that scene from #Anchorman
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-05-30 22:20:57	Lakeshore Rd west is washed out before #Clarkson just a heads up #Mississauga
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-06-01 13:46:44	Was it really necessary to kill that bear in Newmarket this morning? I'm pretty sure tranquilizers were invented for this purpose
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-06-02 18:36:57	Anyone who drives in Toronto knows that tearing down any part of the #Gardiner is a stupid idea
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-06-04 01:12:22	Only Don Cherry could pronounce Joel wrong #Grapes #StanleyCupFinal
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-06-04 02:32:08	Is Guy Boucher still coaching Tampa? #Trap #NHLPlayoffs #StanleyCupFinal
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-06-08 20:26:00	@sternshow please have #NicktheNerd on every day, he is the greatest @lucky7bar #wackpack
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-06-11 21:55:47	I know you don't have hockey anymore, but 4 channel's of the same women's soccer game really necessary @TSN_Sports #PTI
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-06-18 22:00:06	I feel bad for the players this week. This course is a piece of garbage, I mean look at those 'greens' #USOpen
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-06-19 01:40:19	Great bababooey on the last @RickieFowler shot @sternshow #USOpen
81245318	Crawfornication	2015-06-20 23:38:27	Awesome #Bababooey right there on the last Spieth shot #USOpen2015
