83107922	Batchala	2012-02-18 01:09:47	@Chrifff she's such an obvious choice though! Be a little less predictable #guuuuh
83107922	Batchala	2012-02-18 01:18:00	@Chrifff Emma stone is such a predictable choice of male fantasy....I thought you were hipster Mannnnn!
83107922	Batchala	2012-02-18 01:20:05	@Chrifff oh please. The rocker is not obscure.

83107922	Batchala	2013-06-15 18:08:36	Feeling pretty murderous #hickey
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-13 13:28:16	I am far too yawny today
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-14 13:23:53	Love going bra shopping with old temp manager Jo! #unexpected #nevertell
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-15 20:55:39	Sorry kids this is gonna be a long one
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-15 20:56:23	I cannot express my girlish joy at finally a superman movie made exactly how I imagined it when I read the comics.
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-15 20:57:26	Outstanding film. Hans zimmer claps again. My opinion. I know there's dissagreement but I FUCKING loved that
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-15 21:04:02	@JackKonEl I literally am relieved. Been so disappointed and I thought cavill was a sublime casting
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-15 21:18:49	@JackKonEl I think the sooner people realise that there's never going to be a "perfect" superman film, they realise that was pretty good
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-18 10:09:59	@OziBatch is the biggest ache of a human
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-18 12:08:45	@Loren_Rickard you have no idea. I'm on a treadmill and it's getting Slippy
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-18 23:23:08	Holy fuuuuck. That was too much #hellish
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-19 00:09:50	@OziBatch @EmmaLouise125 the amount you''ve gone on about employee of the month is making me think you've staged it
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-16 08:21:05	Happy fathers day old man. Gifts given and received. Now for eggs!
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-18 11:44:32	Oh gym, I would say it's a pleasure to be back....
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-18 13:35:17	@Loren_Rickard your secrets safe with me so long as you tell them about mine on the rowing machine
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-21 16:48:18	I would have absolutely destroyed pointless today #stupidcontestants
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-21 22:42:09	@Hodgiemonster I WOULD NEVER BLOCK YOU
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-22 10:56:57	Wine tasting at 9am....oh go on then!

83107922	Batchala	2013-06-26 09:42:13	Old habits are hard to beat
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-26 15:20:05	New tattoo done. If I say I want another, take me out and shoot me.

83107922	Batchala	2013-06-26 08:28:48	Psyching up for pain
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-27 18:21:34	The girl behind me has the absolute WORST loud posh accent #shutupnoonecares!
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-27 18:40:19	@JackKonEl yes. Far more annoying on a woman
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-27 19:25:48	@JackKonEl thankyou. This beautiful wine is helping ease the stress
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-28 10:10:35	So contrary to last night's tweet, it seems that grandma's goodbye parade can wake me
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-28 16:29:19	Getting VERY emotional at finding nemo
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-27 23:19:52	The blitz won't be able to wake me tomorrow #dayoff
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-29 14:10:41	So the westboro church use Yiddish in their official statement on Taylor swift being a whore #idiots
83107922	Batchala	2013-06-28 21:57:40	Arranging done for the night. Now to finish this wine and crack on with the Ben and jerrys and articles monkeys
