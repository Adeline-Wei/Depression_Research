852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-01-27 21:00:31	Looking for a book on food culture and religions. Anyone know any good suggestions? #food #religion
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-01-29 17:54:58	@CharcutierLtd @CharcutiersWife it's winter, that's just the outlet from your boiler!
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-01-28 20:49:29	@CharcutierLtd want to go halves? http://t.co/YJYjKnlZKr
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-01-29 06:58:38	@CharcutierLtd Damn, I can't afford that.
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-03 04:17:34	Stunning fruit de mer platter at the Savoy Hotel. If only I could eat like this everyday!! http://t.co/RK7G5hI1gq
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-01 16:35:54	@CharcutierLtd I've bought you a new office desk. Make room for it. http://t.co/RPgEzeMzQn
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-04 21:09:29	@CharcutierLtd that's some healthy cheese portions there!
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-07 10:08:09	@JamzMurr very true, but @Tesco deliver most items with very short shelf life. @Asda is better for this, but nothing in stock!
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-07 13:10:18	@AsdaServiceTeam why would I shop online only then to have 36% of my shopping not turn up?
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-07 13:26:42	@CharcutierLtd new potential product line? http://t.co/T69NC1ou3j
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-07 18:58:53	@AsdaServiceTeam already did. Spoke to a lady who didn't give a shit. Refund a few quid. Doesn't solve the issue of all the subs.
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-07 19:00:18	@ClarabellClare @AsdaServiceTeam I know, called them yesterday, woman on the other end didn't give a shit.
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-07 19:04:24	@ClarabellClare @AsdaServiceTeam did you get deodorant instead of toothpaste too?!!
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-06 17:13:48	In what world @asda is woman's deodorant and sausage casserole a substitute for toothpaste and baked beans?!! http://t.co/4JqIgIQwYX
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-06 17:15:12	@asda or cotton pads for cotton buds?!
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-06 17:26:22	@asda plus a grand total of 36% of my order substituted!! Awful service, I left @Tesco for this?!
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-06 19:46:38	@AsdaServiceTeam @asda already did. Spoke to a lady who didn't give a shit. Refund a few quid. Doesn't solve the issue of all the subs.
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-11 19:59:52	@AsdaServiceTeam I was told the store manager was going to call me, that was 5 day ago. Needless to say, I will not be shopping with u again
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-12 18:47:23	@AsdaServiceTeam yes by Twitter and phone. All talk. No action.
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-13 16:13:02	@AsdaServiceTeam as I said 3 tweet previous, waiting for a store manager to call.
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-13 18:03:48	Going out in Camden on a Friday night. This could be interesting!
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-13 18:04:44	@CharcutierLtd can I get mates rates?!
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-14 06:01:16	@CharcutierLtd you'd probably charge me more!
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-14 11:38:06	@CharcutierLtd you one of them?
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-14 14:24:13	Nothing says "I love you" like a beef heart steak! #valentineday http://t.co/17GXbBqvap

852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-18 21:51:46	@FGW How the hell can a train to Swansea cost ¬£160 for 2 in middle March?? I just flew x2 people, return to France for a weekend for ¬£70!
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-19 20:52:56	@FGW was looking for ANY late Friday to return Sunday trip in March, london&gt;swansea
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-19 20:55:52	@CharcutierLtd @CharcutiersWife beat her at arm wrestling again?
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-19 20:56:33	@CharcutiersWife @CharcutierLtd self harming to get time of work?
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-19 21:01:16	@FGW nope. I looked at every week in March on trainline, all the same ¬£¬£¬£
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-19 21:06:28	@FGW I've already used your website and all the same as Priceline. Got a discount code I could use instead?üëç
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-20 19:33:01	@FGW wrong way round. London to swansea return
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-20 21:15:19	@FGW so a ¬£100 quid for 2. Goes back to my original tweet of more expensive than my flight to France. I've rented a car for ¬£50 instead.
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-20 21:22:54	@FGW am I not a customer? I've done the london-swansea route for years, never seen prices this high.
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-21 19:25:15	@arcolatheatre tried booking several times and code is not working?
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-22 10:17:10	@CharcutierLtd This needs to be your official uniform. http://t.co/ihm6x8CKsO
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-22 13:15:32	@CharcutierLtd not sure how @CharcutiersWife would feel about that!
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-22 20:40:35	@arcolatheatre was trying to book late sat shows in March for Shrap and April for Clarion.
852582816	CJ_in_London	2015-02-25 19:51:33	@arcolatheatre tried booking again, still not working.
