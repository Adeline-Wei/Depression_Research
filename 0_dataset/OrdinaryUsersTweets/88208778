88208778	ChloeHoughton5	2014-05-12 06:56:57	going into an exam knowing you're going to fail is the most depressing thing

88208778	ChloeHoughton5	2014-05-10 23:02:35	so, you have those friends, that only message you in those group convocations when they need something or to boast about something and
88208778	ChloeHoughton5	2014-05-10 23:03:15	they claim they're your best mate, but they're not, they're people that are only there for their own benefit, not really giving a shit
88208778	ChloeHoughton5	2014-05-10 23:03:43	what you're going through or anything. then you have those other friends that can tell your upset by a simple text, or tone of voice or
88208778	ChloeHoughton5	2014-05-10 23:04:30	even the look you give them. and they know a cup of tea won't fix the world but make it a lot better. they know they're there for them
88208778	ChloeHoughton5	2014-05-10 23:05:34	when they need them the most, even if its just to sit in silence, but you/they know that your there. and vice versa. #youknowwhoyouare
