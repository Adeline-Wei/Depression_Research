909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-07 01:12:21	It's not suppose to be this way
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-07 20:38:22	After a while you just stop giving a fuck
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-08 03:11:45	I was afraid of the dark but now its all that I want.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-08 22:24:47	There's snow way out
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-09 00:03:58	I cant fix all your problems but I can assure you that you are not going through them alone
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-09 00:05:54	I guess its safe to say that all we are and all we will ever be is unfinished buisness.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-09 04:06:22	@aguywithnolife: @justinbieber not buying your new album you son of a bitch. I waited by the fire for HOURS with fondue and you never showed
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-09 15:40:01	reading old messages and seriously wondering how it got like this &lt;&lt;&lt;
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-09 19:10:49	Ironic isn't it? The person that once made you the happiest is now the reason you're so unhappy.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-12 01:01:43	Mixed signals, I hate that shit
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-12 01:05:41	I fell for you, my mistake.

909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-14 20:44:57	Funny how it's fine when you do what you do but once i do it, I'm a piece of shit #reallytho
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-14 22:50:08	Sure nobody can make me smile like you do but nobody ever made me feel like such a piece of shit like you did either #neverendingreality

909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-15 00:06:34	#Thesadpartis I'll always be the one to admit I'm wrong even when I'm not
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-15 04:02:37	It is so easy to believe someone when they tell you exactly what you want to hear.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-22 02:41:10	You can tell a lot about a woman’s mood just by her hands. For an example, if she is holding a gun she’s probably angry #believeitornot
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-22 02:41:40	Smile, your enemies hate it
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-22 02:51:57	Welcome to our society. You will be judged on what you wear, your taste in music, what you look like, and how you act. Enjoy your stay
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-22 02:52:30	That awkward moment when you spell a word so wrong that even auto corrects like "man I got nuthin" #backtoelementary
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-22 02:52:56	I can't help but to wonder where we'd be right now if we never gave up on eachother #bittertweet
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-22 02:53:23	Typing what you really want to say and then deleting it #foreverworried #hewouldntcareanyways
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-22 02:53:49	That moment before you go to bed where your minds consumed of thoughts like what if? Or how come? #gotobedemotions
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-02-22 02:54:30	sometimes it's just hard and i wish i'd never met you.

909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-13 04:54:56	Forever asking myself why I care so much.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-14 22:10:13	Why lie? What's the point, you look worse than you would in the first place.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-15 03:16:14	New day, same old bullshit.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-15 03:25:23	Fuck you.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-17 01:23:37	There's only so much you can take.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-18 03:11:57	The rest is still unwritten
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-17 23:43:30	Cause I don't know if I can take it
I'm so tired of trying to fake it
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-18 03:00:15	Uhmmmm what just happened @cassandratartz 😰😰😰
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-19 03:08:48	There's a whole lot of thing that I will forgive but I just can't take a liar.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-22 02:01:51	I give up.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-19 02:44:24	The feelings got lost in my lungs
They’re burning, I’d rather be numb
And there’s no one else to blame
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-20 03:30:35	All I know is love can make you stupid
And you are just a song on repeat
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-20 20:25:28	New day, same old bullshit.

909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-20 20:41:47	You should really think before you speak.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-21 01:39:00	Sens you disappoint me.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-24 00:36:13	Why do things have to be the way they are😢 #bittertweet
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-24 03:28:49	I wouldn't trade the happiness you've brought into my life for anything

909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-02 02:46:08	If you're lucky enough to get a second chance at something, don't waste it.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-03 13:13:40	It either gets better, or it gets worse, it never just stays the same.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-01 14:23:41	It shouldn't bother me but it does, a lot.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-03 19:12:26	“@SnapchatProbbz: That one asshole that screenshots your ugly snapchat selfies &lt;&lt;&lt;” @cassandratartz
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-03 19:46:01	And some days I just don't know anymore.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-28 02:23:22	Snapchat why are you so addicting?
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-04-28 02:36:54	Making funny faces in pictures because its better to look ugly on purpose
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-03 20:48:56	Days like this I want to drive away
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-03 21:27:56	Every day is worse and the hurt is always bringing me down.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-04 00:38:51	This day needs to just end already #couldntbeworse
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-04 23:59:34	Holy shit... http://t.co/1Xo9yXh5lO

909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-06 22:45:43	Stressed out of my mind😤😥
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-06 22:46:12	Why is happiness so hard to achieve?
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-05 17:18:44	You can take a lot from me, but never everything.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-05 18:00:33	@luke_brooks why are you so odd🙈
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-07 14:08:11	It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep cause everything is never as it seems.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-08 02:06:14	Don't get too close,
It's dark inside,
It's where my demons hide.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-15 22:00:39	But if you never try, you'll never know.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-13 19:13:38	I'm so sick and tired of this never ending game.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-12 15:31:42	Happy Mother's Day to my wonderful mother I couldn't live a day without😍😘💐
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-13 19:16:16	Hypocrites these days.. Do you even realize?
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-13 19:19:38	If only I could just stop time, so I'd actually get a chance to figure things out, instead of being so unsure of what's to come.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-14 01:31:48	Beaten and broken, lost and confused.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-15 22:53:00	@mbriannefleming I love you too&lt;3 thanks for everything love :*
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-14 01:52:01	I guess the best lessons will be learnt through pain
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-15 03:09:47	I hope you're hurting just as much as I am.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-19 02:40:19	I am so blessed to have the friends I do, idk what is do without them😘
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-19 02:46:13	I just hope that you're okay.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-19 22:32:20	Well, that hurts.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-20 02:10:01	I can't help but to wonder what's going through your mind, does it conspire to what's going through mine?
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-20 05:28:34	This mind of mine never sleeps.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-05-21 21:21:06	We all feel lost sometimes.

909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-09-24 17:27:30	Sometimes I can't tell if things are actually better, or I just think they are
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-09-24 21:16:18	People who hide their feelings usually end up caring the most

909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-09-26 20:29:48	When you chase the wrong things, you outrun the right things
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-09-26 23:09:52	Be all in or get all out. There is no halfway.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-09-26 23:18:53	I would live forever if I could, but not like this.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-09-26 23:24:44	I think you outta stay away from here. There are ghosts in the walls &amp; they crawl in your head through your ear.
909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-09-26 23:31:20	I said it before I won't say it again, love is a game to you.

909153198	HayliCarpenter	2013-10-06 09:49:51	But in the end we only regret the chances we never took
