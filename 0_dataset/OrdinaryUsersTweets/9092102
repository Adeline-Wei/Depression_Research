9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-02-18 02:27:01	Getting started with the Nonoba Multiplayer API video tutorial http://tinyurl.com/av8n3y
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-02 19:49:32	We just released a Nonoba.com module that allows users to submit better meta data. Should be interesting  - http://tinyurl.com/bbnryp
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-03 16:02:38	Time to start structuring my twittering, so added the widget to my website and made a twitter schedule. Expect more from me in the future.
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-03 18:04:04	One of the things people ask me most is how to synch users in a multiplayer environment. Some insights and code: http://tinyurl.com/c636bs
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-03 18:05:08	@MatttLloyd People just kept adding me, so I figured I better start talking about what I do.
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-03 18:09:30	I've decided to write a message for each new person that adds me to twitter. This message is a direct result of this :)
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-04 14:06:28	@ripcurlx Guess I have quite a lot of twittering to do ;)
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-05 11:57:22	If you are a flash game developer you should attend flash game summit. Mostly because we are going to be there ;) http://tinyurl.com/c4zw8o

9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-05 12:55:56	@humentech Yea I saw FOM, its pretty great. The engine will use the Nonoba API for multiplayer. But yes the entire project will be OS.
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-05 13:09:28	I'm rather sad I did not see the twitter code competition by @gskinner before now. Go make a new one so I can participate.
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-05 14:21:44	@Seldaek Well it's a new engine in as3. The hope is to make something so simple, that even novices can build games on it.
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-06 09:09:27	Nonoba in Chinese looks rather cool http://5dyouxi.com/
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-06 17:36:38	@mikearauz Funky - Makes you wonder if TweetDeck routes the messages trough their own systems. Would be rather scary.
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-08 19:27:21	@MatttLloyd Makes you happy you signed up ages ago.
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-08 19:58:07	@mrdoob Cool - Reminds me of my efforts to combine my fractal landscape generator http://bit.ly/z05aK and a visualizer http://bit.ly/t1mCL
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-08 20:32:12	@mrdoob Ohh thats great - I love how applying smoothing gives much nicer looking islands.

9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-16 16:04:10	@ferodynamics Congratulations - what sort of eCPM do you get on the site?
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-16 16:18:16	@ferodynamics Makes sense - I never expected to live of my pet projects anyway. Just an interesting subject.
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-16 18:23:10	Old flash particle project + Reddit logo = Reddit frontpage in 20 min!  http://bit.ly/1aq3wj

9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-17 11:35:19	@Nikolaibibo Thanks! Do show what you end up creating..

9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-05 14:19:59	@MatttLloyd You properly did. In the end it's somewhat a good thing that I did not see it. Imagine the hours I would sink into it.
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-06 09:43:54	@MatttLloyd What's preventing you from twittering at home?
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-06 17:05:13	Just enabled directory browsing for the ISO3 engine. http://bit.ly/EeHVF There are some experiments with shadows, but I am not satisfied yet

9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-06 17:29:15	@mikearauz  Works perfectly here.... Does the website itself work for properly for you?
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-08 16:32:42	Revisiting old projects; recoding and optimizing the internals is a great experience. http://bit.ly/1a9Z0S was this afternoons fun.
9092102	Benjaminsen	2009-03-08 20:06:01	@mrdoob Cool - To me it looked as a part of this video http://bit.ly/6tX7X - but not sure the cd cover is the original source.

9092102	Benjaminsen	2010-02-12 10:42:19	@FanOfStomperNet the URL on your twitter profile does not work.
9092102	Benjaminsen	2010-02-12 12:28:40	@elsassph Adobe Social is great, but our aim is to make it easy to auth 3rd party users towards our services which is not possible with fps
9092102	Benjaminsen	2010-02-15 13:53:43	@CloCkWeRX I use a bunch of 3rd party API's to get data. Pretty much all of them does now allow data redistribution - so not just copyright.
9092102	Benjaminsen	2010-02-15 13:56:26	RT @PlayerIO: We just released a small update to the servers with better VB.Net support and forced Culture info. http://bit.ly/au04KB

9092102	Benjaminsen	2010-02-22 10:33:20	What's the thing that annoys you most about ActionScript3?
9092102	Benjaminsen	2010-02-22 11:46:33	@zwetan Personally I think I have a pretty good idea of what AVM2 can do. What would you say is missing?
9092102	Benjaminsen	2010-02-22 14:21:44	@zwetan Pretty interesting, I get the desire to override basic functionality

9092102	Benjaminsen	2010-02-24 08:56:30	@EgoAnt Well tell us why you need MD5 and or SHA1 and we might include it!
9092102	Benjaminsen	2010-02-24 09:11:34	@humentech What parts are the worst? Event based error handlers or  that we don't have global error handlers before 10.1. Try #FlashDevelop!
9092102	Benjaminsen	2010-02-24 09:21:49	I wonder how much of this is spam and retweets http://bit.ly/b2fhyj
9092102	Benjaminsen	2010-02-24 14:17:13	@EgoAnt I seeOliver already replied to your thread - But sounds reasonable!
9092102	Benjaminsen	2010-02-26 11:32:27	@zwetan I found that braking the #flash decompilers are pretty simple. Everybody should have their own, braking decompilers totally!

9092102	Benjaminsen	2010-02-26 16:08:14	@zwetan The same in my case, I found that simple stuff like swapping AVM2 asm instructions will crash pretty much all decompilers.
9092102	Benjaminsen	2010-02-26 16:50:45	@zwetan Loader.loadBytes() I assume?
9092102	Benjaminsen	2010-03-01 23:30:27	I made a small multiplayer platform game where you can edit the world as a test http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/529148

9092102	Benjaminsen	2014-10-02 15:54:57	@Stephen1_Clarke sadly the game went down with the Nonoba backend. I have it on my longterm todo to remake it for phones and tablets.
9092102	Benjaminsen	2014-10-06 14:35:44	@Stephen1_Clarke I don't think a game developer can get better praise than that :)
9092102	Benjaminsen	2014-10-06 14:47:26	@Stephen1_Clarke nomatter what it will not return exactly as you remember it as it was build with Nonoba tech. But I want to remake it.
