929639150	AltWhitter	2013-04-24 21:59:46	@BBCSporf I can't put into words how much I despise the soi-disant 'Premiere League'
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-04-28 12:30:13	Pruritis ani is the medical terminology for itchy arse. Don't say you never learn things on Twitter.
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-04-25 21:41:03	If a number 1 is a wee and a number 2 is a poo, then a haircut is a 197. And BTW, I've just had a 226 and a 774, and then had to have a 48.
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-04-27 08:45:33	@GI1970 @ThePoke That's a subjunctive clause, so it should be 'If I were a balloon'.
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-04-27 08:58:37	After two days of not understanding Twitter, I have to ask, WTF is JLS? I'm guessing a new sitcom about 4 unemployed young men.
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-04-27 09:03:34	@cluedont For goodness sake, it's ten o'clock in the morning. Wine o'clock started three hours ago.

929639150	AltWhitter	2013-05-16 15:55:19	#beckhamfacts David Beckham has campaigned for many years against the barbaric practice of parsley baffling.
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-05-16 16:00:39	#beckhamfacts David Beckham once went shopping for a tasty new product from the freezer aisle called 'Spice Grills'.

929639150	AltWhitter	2013-05-16 16:02:34	#beckhamfacts David Beckham is very worried about his new career working as a luthier. He's constantly fretting.
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-05-17 22:28:06	A printer AND a scanner in the office? Forget it. Just get one or the other and a time machine.
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-05-17 22:33:40	Once asked friends 'what's the strangest place you've ever had sex?' My two favourite answers were 'my armpit' and 'Yeovil'.
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-05-17 22:40:48	Got to work this morning and surprised to find a massive H in my office. Then I remembered that I'm a professional rugby player.
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-05-17 22:44:28	I got to work the day after tomorrow and was surprised to find the printer missing. Then I would have remembered my time-travel scanner.

929639150	AltWhitter	2013-05-17 21:54:29	@govindajeggy There's also a 'mate' in team, hence 'team mate'.  It's all falling into place.
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-05-17 22:24:16	I've eaten sea urchins more recently than I've eaten Angel Delight.  Both equally vile.
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-05-17 22:51:34	Asking if you mean 'figuratively' when you say 'literally', is a rhetorical question. Rhetorical questions are literally a figure of speech.

929639150	AltWhitter	2013-05-24 01:38:32	@ArenaFlowers @govindajeggy And when Prince Philip pops in the pub for one, he hands the barman a tenner and says 'Did her'.
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-05-22 13:49:14	I was invited to a hog roast last week. Very disappointing. There were no Premier League footballers there, and a pig had died.

929639150	AltWhitter	2013-07-06 22:56:23	Also I couldn't wear my oven glove at the beer festival because 'people will look at you and think you're strange'. At a beer festival FFS!
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-07-07 23:02:30	Just had a great telly idea. Each week contestants perform a task. Viewers vote and each week one contestant leaves. It could catch on.

929639150	AltWhitter	2013-07-17 00:37:42	Bad things about being a tree would be that you can't go to the pub, and having massive wood would impress nobody.
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-07-21 15:38:43	Watching the cricket today. Not much to report, he's just chirping and hopping about a bit.
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-07-21 22:42:00	At mate's house. He asked what music I fancied, so I suggested some Mingus and he put on Girls Aloud.

929639150	AltWhitter	2013-10-30 22:14:15	@tinytwink It's wrong to have two favourite kids. You can't play them off against each other unless only one is your fave. Grow up!

929639150	AltWhitter	2013-11-02 23:41:37	I had 6 pints and a double bacon cheeseburger before the rugby this afternoon. Frankly, the coach was right to sub me in the second half.

929639150	AltWhitter	2013-11-05 16:57:58	Thought you might like to know I've got a mood ring. Right now it's a bit itchy and making me cross.
929639150	AltWhitter	2013-11-05 17:13:45	Lot of stuff about Guy Fawkes today. Not much about Lady Spoons though.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-02 23:44:13	@Colinthecabbie Wilco, you're a very funny man.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-04 17:20:32	5 youths lurking near Newport bus station. Loud hippety-rap-hop music coming off them, but no discernable source. Disconcerting.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-04 09:13:46	@PFPTMillsy If all books are £2, then each book will be £2 divided by the number of books in the shop. I'm a pedantic twat.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-07 08:25:59	'Pat' reversed is the synonymous 'tap'. 'Ward'becomes its antonym 'draw'. Pat Ward, nurse on Father Ted, Tap Draw is a plumbing shop near me

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-04 11:44:18	I'd improve football by making footballers take a vote of poverty and chastity. And by sending Vincent Tan into space. Permanently.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-06 00:37:15	@wtfpmsl Now the colour of Alex Fergusson and it took 45 minutes, but I think I qualify. Will you be my special interwebs friend?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-07 18:23:34	Two barmen walk into a horse. The bar says to them 'Why the long faces?' and one of them replies 'Is the beer alright?'
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-07 00:14:55	Screws are really just crinkle-cut nails. But all lah-di-dah and a hammer's not good enough for them, they need a twisty implement.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-07 00:16:04	@Upscale_Luxury @DruggyBuilder Who buys a Bugatti and thinks 'I wonder if they do it in beige?'

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-08 01:35:22	@ComedyCocks Maybe getting a weekly kicking will teach the 'fans' who've never been near Old Trafford some humility? Fat fucking chance.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-08 01:46:45	I'm sure Moyes will sort out #ManUtd and take them back to the top. Kidding, he's out of his depth, they'll win nothing and finish mid-table
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-08 08:07:36	@angryplumber Or pointless telephone message?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-08 18:59:37	Gloria Estefan's real name is 'Glorious Tea Fan' and she's an ambassador for Typhoo, as is Bruce Swillers.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-08 19:08:04	@Crayola_wankers @wtfpmsl If you can think of it, someone enjoys doing it. Goats in wellies? What kind of wellies, and are the goats pretty?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-08 20:29:47	@wtfpmsl That's thinking outside the box. Or right inside it more to the point. Goat box, horse box, every one a winner.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-09 08:19:42	@angryplumber Yeah, knackered this morning.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-10 17:13:45	I'm having stand up, stand up pizza for tea this evening. Four cheeses.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-11 23:56:36	@PFPTMillsy Fair nuff. I still stand by the no-kids decision past 50.Loads of disposable income and no little fucker touching my stuff.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-13 01:13:07	@DruggyBuilder Friday afternoon working on the barn conversion. Jim had a few 'bows at lunchtime. He's got wood. http://t.co/kr7ITdmts3

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-15 07:45:11	The word 'karate' is from the French for 'hidden scorpion'. Jackie Chan is French, but Chuck Norris is made from parsley.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-15 08:02:42	@BritBehaviour @DruggyBuilder But if I had clear skin you could see all my internal organs. I wouldn't like that.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-01-21 08:20:23	Going on holiday and your suitcase isn't big enough? Simply replace all your socks and pants with Castrol 3-in-1 oil. Then stay at home.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-02-01 21:50:38	@ArrivaTW Thanks for shutting Queen Street station, I really enjoyed a long walk in the pissing rain. Also loved all the extra trains.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-02-22 00:03:26	@tinytwink I demand that you bring this puppy to my house now. Also I an not childless and middle-aged. She must be my baby!

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-02-25 17:13:19	Stan Collymore's full name is Standard Colours Yellow and Maroon. He wrestles pilchards.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-02-25 23:25:45	@argusoncounty @NewportCounty  So we've lost 2 in a row. So what? We're doing okay, we're staying up, and think what we've done in 25 years!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-02-25 23:32:38	Train replaced by bus. If the bus breaks down will it be replaced by spacehoppers? Or continental drift? #ArrivaTW
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-02-24 17:56:05	I cut my finger beating eggs this morning. My own fault, I should have done a whisk assessment.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-02-24 18:04:38	The Steve Winwood song 'Higher Love' is much funnier if you substitute the words 'oven glove'.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-02-28 00:10:02	'All you need is love' sang the Beatles. Not very good advice for Andy Murray. Mind, would it kill the miserable twat to smile now and then?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-01 11:53:54	Super-cool guitarist with iconic punk band, and badly excited middle-aged fan. But which is which? #anwl http://t.co/AduCB0ngG6
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-02-28 14:59:17	@EarthPix @HistoryInPics It would be like living in a packet of Opal Fruits.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-07 02:46:36	@BigJohnTerry @BBCSporf Drinking lava, sticking a fork in an electrical socket and swallowing a hand-grenade whole might be quite risky.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-07 02:49:23	Update on the lego thing. It tastes like what it's been next to. Apparently the cat's litter tray. So now we know.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-07 02:54:33	Just a thought: Katie Price - why Jordan? The Thames is much closer to home.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-07 03:08:49	@BiscuitAhoy I've got a magical wall-tail electrical cold-cupboard. With magnets on from where I've been.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-09 15:52:17	There's a woman on the telly wearing a shirt with 'Brains' on the front. I wonder if she's got a hat with 'Tits' on it?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-07 17:31:43	This is the filth they're currently enjoying in Berlin. The saucy scamps. http://t.co/pF5ExKrMKG
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-08 19:26:43	I've been saying the word 'hopper' for 45 minutes now, and it's lost all meaning and set up a strange resonance in my mind. #thecoolkids

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-07 02:42:59	If anyone's interested, I'm drinking Asbach and listening to Leonard Cohen. And wondering what Lego tastes like.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-07 03:02:26	@tinytwink 'Nadia' to me at 6.30am please. I'm married, I know the score. Also I've been on the lash in Berlin since Sunday.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-08 19:34:54	'Sepp Blatter' is a corruption of 'Septic Bladder', the nickname of Farino Catto, the boy whose ball it is. If he goes all football is off.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-10 14:01:53	I call my shower 'the rain cupboard' because I'm hilarious.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-10 17:18:54	The Nintendo Gameboy has been bought out by Dell. It'll now be known as the Dell Boy, and come with rubbish, cockney-themed games.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-12 23:02:24	@JCautomatic I'm a network administrator and once told a middle-aged lady who couldn't see a file that I'd changed her tights
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-12 23:23:23	One of my cats (Twiglett) is making a noise like a trimphone. Is she alone in doing that?

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-10 23:12:14	What is it that everyone eats but nobody has ever marketed? Bogies. Nose-fruit. Finger-raisins. Must be a fortune to be made.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-11 19:50:50	@TheQuotePics @AmazingTiming I'm very afraid of going to prison. That wouldn't make me very free.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-11 19:57:41	A better word for pear would be pepple. Alternatively apple could be renamed aear. Also bananas should be called custard-smiles.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-11 23:06:50	@argusoncounty @NewportCounty Folks, moaning will do nothing. Get down to the Exeter game, it'll be good for the team, the club, and for you
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-12 22:56:23	@HarrisGl But every programme is repeated on every channel 15 times a day. Also I'm half-cut. Do me a #ff and I'll send you some tulips.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-12 23:17:23	@JCautomatic a bloke half my age had a go on her at a Christmas party. Can't think of a joke. Nice smile and great tits.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-16 00:17:37	@foxxTKE I bet you're a hit too with your illiterate, ill-punctuated, moronic rubbish. Please fuck off to the hole you crawled out of.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-16 00:34:13	@foxxTKE @JohnP_9 It is a word. You are a massive ill-educated, ignorant, pointless twat. Is stupid a recognised disability where you are?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-16 01:42:04	@JohnP_9 @foxxTKE Oh no! Hope I dont embarass anyone as clever as you! What the fuck is wrong with you morons?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-16 01:49:17	@foxxTKE @JohnP_9 I'm now blocking you because you're so depressingly awful and stupid.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-16 00:02:01	@foxxTKE 1 It was a shit film. 2 Still inexcusable. 3 If you want 'rapist looking' to act as an adjective, you have to hypenate it. 4 Twat
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-16 00:18:55	@BiscuitAhoy That's weasely the most stoatly awful thing I've ever seen.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-16 00:42:41	Right, I've had an arguement, a new follower and a favourite, so I'm off to bed to drink Rioja and talk to the cats.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-16 12:16:10	Newport train like a cattle truck. So much money for such a shit service. #ArrivaTW you should be ashamed.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-16 12:00:00	Train as full as a fat man's shoe. But with one train every 2 hours it would be.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-16 23:31:51	@TheAmberTweets I was there, not the best game of football I've ever seen!

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-16 00:37:54	@foxxTKE Big words? Like wheelbarrow and corrugated? And minor what? Problem? Unlike the huge one you have with English. You are such a twat
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-16 00:40:39	Woo-hoo! 39! Cheers @DarrenMacRae72!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-16 01:12:34	@foxxTKE Can you touch your keyboard without being offensive? Also I've won because you're a cretin.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-16 23:55:26	@argusoncounty @NewportCounty Fair nuff a bit dull today, but we defended well and got a point. We're playing league football, still happy!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-16 23:45:39	@angryplumber How about crevice? Actually, is that a word? Crevice? Not sure it sounds like one.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-17 00:05:28	@cluedont I'm drunk AND I've had a fight
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-19 17:57:08	You don't see blokes with an anorak, a wispy beard and glasses walking to work reading a Harry Potter book anymore. Wonder where they went?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-19 01:03:15	This evening I drove past my old school whilst listening to Steely Dan's 'My Old School'. I have no idea what this could mean.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-19 01:07:40	There was an unexplained sock on the landing last month, and now there's another one. There are no accidents, what can this mean?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-19 01:09:11	On Saturday I had to buy some nails to fix a shelf in the garage, and then this evening I had to trim my own nails. Where will this end?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-19 01:13:28	My mate Ian has a shirt with sleeves that look like an owl, and I've never seen him in the same room as an owl. Coincidence?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-19 01:13:49	Today I bought some herbs to grow in the back garden, and now it's thyme for bed. Can this just be a coincidence?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-20 08:21:20	@EE Can I expect a reduction in my bill after last night? Also for 5 days of phone not working in Germany despite assurances that it would?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-20 22:56:26	Lost 50p at the bingo, but drank 99 pints of Carling, so think I broke even. Gawd bless yer mister Osborne. Lumme. Corks. Strike a light.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-22 00:05:14	@History_Pics Bummed them all. Except the lad smoking a fag. His breath smelled like turds.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-21 19:39:28	@ComedyCocks  Not brilliant, but I'm making the best of the material available. Thank you. http://t.co/LKMVJ8fkWp
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-22 16:37:06	@ArrivaTW  So to recap: 10 minute journey on a very crowded train, 25 minute wait to buy a ticket. Also 6 positions, 3 ticket sellers. Poor.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-21 11:54:58	@BiscuitAhoy He looks like he's pulling his pancreas out of his mouth. The fat-tongued, mockney jizzbaton.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-21 15:02:23	@dannycrow28 @argusoncounty Nice one Danny. If the team has a bad patch we should be right behnd them, not pissing and moaning. Up the Port!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-22 20:33:59	@Cardiffbus 2 buses didn't arrive at Fidlas Road, so evening out with missus cancelled. Not impressed.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-23 20:45:18	Ronalding is where you have a friend called Ronald over for cake.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-22 12:53:21	@ArrivaTW no ticket inspectors on the Llanishen train, the a 15 minute queue to get one on Cardiff Central. This is very poor isn't it?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-22 12:58:09	@ArrivaTW You must be very proud of how efficient your service is. 18 minutes and still no ticket. SORT THIS OUT. http://t.co/nszklnY91B
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-22 13:02:01	@ArrivaTW Saturday afternoon, Cardiff Rugby at home, Cardiff City at home, only 2 carriages on the train from Ystrad. Like a cattle truck.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-22 13:04:30	@ArrivaTW  Now been queueing for 23 minutes. Can I bill you for my time? You owe me £15 including price of ticket.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-23 23:23:09	If you love parsley, chances are you remember that thing with the bloke from Blue Peter. I'm off to bed now.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-25 22:35:35	@NewportCounty Didn't go to Torquay, but huge step up from the Daggers game. Confidence and belief, looking forward to Pompey. Up the Port!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-25 22:41:00	@argusoncounty A point and an order of magnitude better than last Wednesday's Daggers game. I'm seeing it as a positive game.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-25 22:58:15	@EarthBeauties @TheWorldImages I'd rather go to the been-around-the-block-a-few-times Islands. Thank you.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-25 23:19:03	@mcwotsee @argusoncounty Good point, my dear old mum would have scored a couple they missed, and make us a cup of tea after!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-25 23:20:36	@ArgusKevinWard @argusoncounty @NewportCounty And I, for one, enjoyed the game. Good to see a bit of spirit about us. Up the Port!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-25 23:26:39	Next 5 RTs will have an iPhone 5 left in my desk drawer as it's a bit wank and we all hate Apple fan boys.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-03-31 23:41:21	The 45 miles from Carmarthen to Aberystwyth takes 6 hours 25 minutes on the train, the same as the 400 miles from Cardiff to Glasgow.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-15 19:35:45	I think that strange creaking sound I can only hear at night is my hair growing. Our my tapeworm reciting his poems.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-12 10:28:12	Just painted my bollocks and am now known as the Green Goolie. Sorry, the Teal-Testicled Tornado. FFS.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-16 09:28:46	As a result of Bow-Caning Syndrome @owenphelps now has a prefrontal strapaducktome. Please RT to raise awareness. http://t.co/fKEpAXKDtl

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-16 12:35:03	BBC website: "Miley Cyrus' tour bus has been destroyed after it caught fire. Nobody was harmed but the vehicle was gutted." I'll bet it was.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-12 16:29:09	Crimping off a massive poo in Newport. The dirty, smelly hippy who was coiling down an otter before me didn't wash his hands.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-12 16:33:11	@NewportCounty Absolutely class strike. Saw it from the North Terrace. #stayingup
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-16 21:06:40	Just been telling my cats about plankton. They think it's krilliant.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-16 21:23:08	I've just had violent Chris Straits. It's a bit like Dire Rea, but each episode only lasts 20 seconds not 14 minutes.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-16 22:49:10	If you sit on your own head and wonder if you're in a forest, can you hear yourself think, or are you dead from extreme bending in half?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-16 23:21:29	I have 8 fingers and 2 thumbs. Some very busy, some hardly used. I don't have a favourite, so how do folks decide on their favourite kid?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-15 17:47:11	Someone's I like to scratch my arse with both hands whilst humming loudly and nodding. I call it a nodular scrotchhum.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-15 21:10:36	Just brushed my teeth but now I'm hungry. I'm going to push a cheese sandwich up my nose. With mustard and gherkins. And a can of coke.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-17 16:28:06	My sister from the arse-end of rural Herefordshire is coming round this evening and apparently I'm not allowed to do bumpkin jokes. FML.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-16 04:40:29	You could make a lobster from a stick of celery with broccoli attached with fishing line, and chives on top. Maybe currants for eyes.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-19 12:24:00	Just saw an advert with Carol Vorderman in it. Disappointed, I thought she'd got the message and fucked off after Countdown.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-21 10:58:19	@TonyCowards @BiscuitAhoy This year I had a Crueller Egg. It tasted of mustard and bit my arm.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-21 11:07:14	Journalists who write 'saw red' instead of 'had a red card' should be covered in lime marmalade and called Maurice.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-26 23:32:50	Couple of shandies, listening to the @Oysterband1 on YouTube. My cats love Diamonds on the Water, they've listened to a lot of Oysterband!

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-28 19:00:57	The question should not be 'why have I got 4 types of mustard in my house?'But 'why have I only got 4 types of mustard in my house? '
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-28 00:45:20	I once ate a whole cheesecake on my own. Very funny poo afterwards.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-28 20:58:16	I own much mustard, and yet still my elbow hurts. It's hot and pink, a bit like a tasty sausage that would benefit from mustard.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-05-01 15:47:59	@KTHopkins That should be 'were a mother' - this is a subjunctive clause. Also 'right on' should be hyphenated, as it's a compound adjective
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-29 21:20:58	@CentreTransfer @BBCSporf But mainly pies and whores though?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-29 21:28:19	@MerthyrTownFC  Fantastic result! Really chuffed and just know Monday's going our way!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-29 21:33:29	Put the mustard in alphabetical order this evening. From Dijon to wholegrain. Also told the cats a joke about flip-flops. They loved it.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-04-30 22:44:02	Congrats to whichever journalist got this one past an editor. http://t.co/ihjYRho9lv

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-05-09 06:44:17	I pick my nose and use bogies to predict the future. I am Nostrildamus. Thank you.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-05-08 20:47:51	Iophobia is a fear of rust. It's also a metaphor for the fear of aging and failure.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-05-08 22:23:20	Can you have blinkochia? I'm sure my blinks aren't in unison. Sure my left eye is trailing a smidge.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-05-09 22:45:43	I divine the future with orange stuff that I've rubbed on bits of paper. I call them Carot cards. Thank you.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-05-30 19:01:43	Fair enough to Farage for liking a pint, given that every time he orders one he's got a 50-50 chance of getting glassed.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-05-30 19:05:05	Meeting my brother for a pint at 7.30 and he's not here yet. Given that it's 8.05 he's still passive-agressively early.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-06-14 22:43:10	2 goals, didn't see that coming. Unrelatedly, is Rooney still a massive fan of whores?

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-08-21 22:50:38	@barneyfarmer Just re-read the Vape Man and the bakers with the isopropyl and the boy. You're the lineal successor to William Burroughs.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-08-23 07:55:59	@barneyfarmer @guardian But apparently faux fags might be harmful. WILL NOBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-08-23 11:10:34	How about a librarian who's 120 feet tall and can breathe underwater? Also she is called Katanya and crochets a super-hat from parsley.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-08-23 11:33:00	So the train from Cardiff to London now takes 3 hours. With a 'special' offer to upgrade to first class for £15. #ArrivaTW you are great!

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-08-23 16:33:10	@ArrivaTW I recently made extensive use of the train service in Germany. Please look at what they do and think how you can do likewise.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-09-09 09:14:06	@FGW Llanishen to Paddington, 2 adults, £91.20. How about a 50% refund and 1st class upgrade? Would seem reasonable I think.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-10-25 23:19:34	@electro_mike Pulp Fiction was B movie film noir. L&amp;L was an example of not funny. BTW Laurel and Hardy - lineal ancestors of the DB.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-10-28 19:19:25	@TomChivers @owenphelps @DPJHodges Apparently they're like mice - if you don't drown them more will come. How can these people sleep?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-10-28 19:22:42	When my brother was little he got the company Hern and Crabtree mixed up with the force of gravity and got the Hern of Crabitee. Bless.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-01 18:23:48	@ArrivaTW 18.01 from Llanishen cancelled, 18.16 scheduled for 18.24. I'm going to be nearly 30 mins late meeting my mate. Unacceptable.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-10-30 23:15:29	@christinamartin It is if you're French and suggesting a tentative dip in a river. Pour Tay, toe?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-10-30 23:21:53	@treeby79 @wtfpmsl @gingerwhingers I thought we were talking about a painting of a beautiful lady. By Canaletto.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-10-31 17:15:53	I'm an intelligent man with a keen grip on reality, but I've never been described as 'gormful'.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-01 00:12:25	I was in a supermarket earlier, and a student talked about buying coke, but she pronounced it 'cake'.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-01 00:15:38	@alyankovic Theremin? On ice? In a tutu? Would be my guess
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-01 00:19:32	@stu_sound @biscuitahoy 'YORKSHIRE' uh, just make the rest up.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-01 00:20:38	How do you know if a ninja duck is near? There are no other ducks near.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-01 02:21:00	@HarrisGl Be honest, how many calories did you scarf?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-02 12:22:52	@ArrivaTW Surely you should put on more trains rather than cancelling excusing ones? This makes no sense.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-02 20:12:07	When I was a lad I lived next door to a boy called Tim. Sometimes he would chase me up the street with a Fairy Liquid bottle full of piss.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-05 22:18:54	Twiglett auditioning for 'The Importance of being Earnest'. A handbag? http://t.co/4BfMpZnQrj
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-07 23:49:17	In Germany a hard-hitting weekly news magazine is called Der Speigel. This means 'The Mirror'. Never fails to get a laugh from me.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-07 23:56:22	Just tried to listen to Mingus' Moanin' and had to wait 30 seconds for an advert for a song by some bellend I've never heard of. Twats.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-06 21:49:18	@MarkReckons @barneyfarmer Should the sale of 'excessive alcohol' also be a crime? Or 'aggravated distilling'? There's no responsibility.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-06 21:51:24	@FootyIists @BBCSporf all you need to know is that he's an oily, self-regarding twat.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-09 21:25:48	Apparently calling Anna's Cafe 'Anus Cafe' isn't funny and never will be, no matter how often I say it.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-09 21:35:02	Corduroy is a contraction of cords du roi which means King's Strings. #fact
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-09 22:17:57	@owenphelps Facts. Look them up or make them up. I'm Wales' laziest man, so guess which I do.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-09 17:13:14	Forget #montythepenguin - I've got a Rottweiler called Fist and a crocodile called Mr Munchy-nashers.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-13 21:26:18	Apart from the notice given by this sign. #YouHadOneJob http://t.co/RpVkN6svdm
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-13 21:28:35	So is this sign not an object? Is it just a hypothetical construct? #YouHadOneJob http://t.co/1W3pTU41lc
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-14 01:13:48	@NateDawg27 @jdwtweet @dbbrewingco DB is absolutely lovely, drinking it whenever possible. Food looks a bit like sick though.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-14 01:15:47	@barneyfarmer Thanks, but I'm more a boy for saying what I don't like about Noel Gallagher.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-14 01:17:53	@barneyfarmer She's bean mistreated and the chips are down. Also there's not mushroom in here. Additionally something about bacon.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-14 01:19:39	@barneyfarmer well it does belong to lovers.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-14 03:00:42	@CarryonAngela14 love the Carry On films and always thought you were gorgeous! Swings and Roundabouts now on my Christmas list! Thanks!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-15 15:41:01	Buying olive oil, but all they have here is 'extra-virgin'. I want olive oil that's been round the block a few times and knows a few tricks.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-16 10:24:31	@countymascot Hungover to buggery and the trains are all over the shop (as usual) but I'll be there.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-16 10:36:04	@barneyfarmer @MailOnline The disillusioned always turn to radicals - Germany in the 30s. UKIP's rise is the fault of Blair and Cameron.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-15 18:14:06	Andy having a Homer moment. http://t.co/84ZLDALuj7
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-15 19:24:55	@SLAwrites @Germanwordfor Morgenmuffel would be close, and it's one of German's best words.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-15 22:30:31	@ArrivaTW Just popped into the gents at Cardiff Central. Ankle-deep in piss, sick everywhere. Absolutely filthy. Impressed as always.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-16 00:59:25	You know you're an oenophile when you open a bottle and throw away the cork.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-16 01:09:29	Two sheep go into a pub. Soon all the sheep are in the pub. The moral is have a sign that says 'no sheep in the pub'.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-16 01:14:39	Sad seagull watch is sad. http://t.co/BK9NvFo7mQ
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-16 01:17:37	@tinytwink In German they call it Unspezifischenangst. They're a comforting people.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-16 01:24:03	I've just invented a machine that makes you an inch tall so you can get pissed on a drop of wine off a table. Also I'm the king of Egypt.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-16 01:27:24	I'm thinking of doing a kickstarter for it. The Tinypist 3000.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-16 01:37:29	You won't guess who I had in my bath last night. Angela Douglas! Not literally, but she's always welcome to pop in! http://t.co/afmhXvNHck
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-16 01:39:43	Saturday night, better put all my string in alphabetical order and iron the carpet. Also those bushes aren't going to shout at themselvers.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-16 20:40:19	@Ashley_Bloor In principal yes, will have to see what else is going on.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-16 20:41:25	@Ashley_Bloor But sounds really good to me mate!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-16 21:18:02	@CarryOnJoan Oh I loved that film!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-19 01:19:08	@barneyfarmer It's almost like a government not voting for feudalism. Oh...
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-22 00:17:42	@tinytwink Srsly, 20th Sept? Wow! Are you marking the occasion with setting fire to body gas?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-20 21:40:14	@barneyfarmer Tramp's kidneys sounds like a 'peasant' dish in a restaurant that calls itself a cafe, but is really a massive ponce-hole.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-20 21:45:04	@barneyfarmer Also 'hobo chicken' and there won't be anything specific to hate about the decor, but it will make you want to kill yourself.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-20 21:51:56	If I ever have girl triplets, I'll call them Amy, Shuté and Günregret.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-20 22:06:27	@DerekTheWeather Derek, are we going to get snow like the eastern US this winter?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-23 16:16:59	If you swap the front wheels on your car around, they'll each think they're going backwards. Makes you think.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-25 10:05:49	A better name for 'trombone' would be 'brassy parp-horn'.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-26 16:07:02	@HealeyCartoons Congratulations on your recent spell of good form with Cefn Druids http://t.co/IHdCM3GkhL
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-26 18:39:31	@Cardiffbus 18.26 number 86 from Llanishen station a no-show. Another evening out cancelled. V poor service as usual.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-26 18:46:42	@Cardiffbus Thank you
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-26 21:21:58	Welsh Assembly Government AMs - give yourselves an 18% pay rise. Go on, we think you're worth it. How can anyone get by on 100K?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-26 23:16:44	My father says there is only one perfect view, and that's the view of the sky over our heads.
I expect your father has been reading Dante.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-26 23:44:28	@Footy_Jokes @BBCSporf It's actually an explanation of electrophoresis. It's also wrong as -1 isn't 1 mainly.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-26 23:45:43	@forrest__cunt But it's lovely. Also it gives you horrific wind.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-26 23:49:16	If you mansion house needs haunting just call Thomas Love Peacock.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-27 00:03:34	@barneyfarmer It's not late November, it's very late November. You're a grouch and you hate fun. I've come from a pub with a Christmas tree.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-27 00:12:35	@Danifesto_ @UpikNews I said Ghengis Khan but Immanuel Kant. Action trumps thought.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-27 00:21:09	Lucky American bastards are on the sauce now. Happy Thanksgiving one and all.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-28 17:46:19	I've had the #SteelyDan song #BlackFriday  going round in my head all day. Anyone else?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-28 18:24:10	@UrbanTapHouse  How about some hooks under the bar for leaners who want to take their jacket off? Beer incredible as always, thanks.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-28 18:31:24	@tinytwink When you realise that the echoing emptiness inside you cannot be filled with material things, nor washed away with alcohol.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-28 18:43:51	@adamhess1 I cadged a 'Are you 21?'badge from a Wetherspoons, then wore it at another pub. And THAT'S how you embarrass your missus.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-28 23:18:37	@UrbanTapHouse you have no coat hooks. I'll pop round and sort some out for you!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-29 20:49:06	@CarryonAngela14 very good thanks, and now having a quiet pint with Dai.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-27 18:25:28	My girlfriend threw up in the van at the start of the week. Ruined the upholstery. Sic Transit Gloria Mundi.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-28 23:32:26	@UrbanTapHouse Best pub in Cardiff by a country mile!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-28 23:35:19	@UrbanTapHouse By a huge country mile!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-28 23:55:08	@UrbanTapHouse Huge fan of what you do, also @cityarmscardiff two best pubs in cardiff, 20 yards apart! Usually just bounce back and forth!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-28 23:58:07	@HuffPostUKCom And using 'invite' and 'impact' and 'fragrance' as verbs. They're nouns you fuckwits.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-29 00:01:08	while we're up, anybody else enjoying the music of Samuel Purdey? please listen to Valerie, you'll love it!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-27 21:28:10	You never hear oven settings in the 'regulo' system anymore. Also spangles.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-11-27 21:51:29	@GAMENewport @NewportCounty My dog could do a better job than Van Gaal. And he'd sniff your knackers.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-02 15:58:15	Another example of management being out of touch with the core objectives of a business. http://t.co/eIOeenDpwb
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-02 23:49:54	@sidneyabbot @CarryOnNigella It's an old-school indulgence I know, but who doesn't enjoy fish fingers?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-02 23:55:29	@sidneyabbot @CarryOnNigella ...and I don't think anybody could resist my haddock pie
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-02 23:57:19	@sidneyabbot @CarryOnNigella ...and my local butcher will bend over backwards to accommodate me.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-03 00:09:25	@sidneyabbot @CarryOnNigella Breast or thigh, it's your choice, they're equally delicious once they're smothered in my delicious sauce.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-03 00:50:02	@IanDunt @owenphelps just when you think you can't hate them anymore for betraying 20 years of principle...
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-03 00:53:21	@biscuitahoy Yes it's Wurst, slice them lengthways and wrap them around the pipes. Sausage lagging, mmm
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-02 18:32:19	@Cardiffbus  Hi, is the 86 from Llanishen running - it should h have been here 6 minutes ago. Thanks.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-02 18:39:53	@Cardiffbus Just arrived! Thanks for the update. Cheers
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-03 00:58:55	@TwopTwips  Convince people you're a Chelsea fan by loving 'the Blues' when you haven't been to a fucking football match in your life.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-07 19:13:50	@RogerQuimbly We really don't want that frog-faced arsewit here. Especially not in that horrible wanking coat. Piss-flute tosser.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-11 21:51:24	@barneyfarmer Barney Farmer is short for Barn-based Farming-news. Not just an agricultural meteorologist, but the best. He predicts rain.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-15 23:26:20	@400FootGhost I have to say, I find your pictures always strangely moving, and occasionally quite disturbing.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-15 23:31:51	There was a documentary about the north-east of England on the BBC last week. Missed it, so watched it on the why-aye-player.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-20 01:10:12	@History_Pics am I alone in hating the fucking beatles? they weren't all that!

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-20 04:12:47	@HistoryInPics And yes, I do know this wasn't recently :)
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-19 07:55:04	Dreamt last night that I was about to eat an éclair but then I woke up. Also the steering-wheel trim on my car had come loose. #boringdream
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-19 08:22:13	Just seen a HUGE pigeon in a tree. It was the size of a watermelon! Then realised the tree was a lot closer than I thought. #smallfaraway
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-19 13:32:05	On the same day that A&amp;E in England is reported as being unable to cope, BoJo decides to spunk away £175M on a decorative bridge. Prick.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-21 23:21:31	Day 2 in the potpourri lounge, and it still smells like a whore's boudouir.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-22 17:46:09	Day 3 in the potpourri house. The whole ground floor now smells like supermarket own-brand Toilet Duck.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-22 17:53:19	@barneyfarmer @HealeyCartoons Well that's slightly upsetting, so well done. Haven't seen Sporting Swine in ages.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-20 17:55:27	For reasons I can't explain, we now have a bowl of potpourri in the lounge, and it's fucking honking in there.

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-24 11:53:41	@HealeyCartoons @irowe @barneyfarmer Deeply upsetting as always. Thanks chaps.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-25 11:50:13	@CarryonAngela14  Happy Christmas Angela! Hope you're having a great day. We're cooking and wine is happening!

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-25 12:19:45	Apparently looking out of the window every 2 minutes and saying 'I don't think they're coming' isn't helpful. Well pardon me.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-25 18:00:05	@irowe I think it says 'Savile bits' and something to do with cheese. Helmetic?
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-26 01:50:51	@perfectbabies @CuteOverloads Nah, smells like mustard and poos itself all the time. Kids are horrid, why would anyone have one?

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-27 13:04:39	@ArrivaTW at Cardiff Central, 40-yard queue for tickets. Why can you not get this right? It's not difficult.
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-24 23:00:14	@themurenger Cheers for the beers in 2014, we'll be back for a couple on Boxing day. Thanks for all your fantastic pubbing, happy Christmas!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-24 23:07:24	@UrbanTapHouse Thanks for all the beer this year. You've been the best pub in the universe!  See you in the new year xxx
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-25 00:56:00	@Thenewsagent @themurenger @thenewsagentjr Oh I wish I were there!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-25 00:59:29	@themurenger Also Dai says he hates the pub and hopes he never has to set foot inside it ever again. Kidding! He's picking me up on Friday!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-25 01:02:36	@Kyshera Have a good one boys, keep on rocking in the free world!
929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-25 01:16:44	@cityarmscardiff Yo! Have a great Christmas, and thanks for all the beers this year!

929639150	AltWhitter	2014-12-30 23:33:57	@wtfpmsl It's not that unusual. Also he looks like he might be capable of murdering me.

929639150	AltWhitter	2015-01-08 00:04:45	@wtfpmsl Islam, Judaism and Christianity all specifically say 'don't kill, it's bad'. Those who do, do not do in the name of God.

929639150	AltWhitter	2015-01-23 18:16:41	It surprises me that more superheros aren't just a bit of a twat about things rather than being a force for good.

929639150	AltWhitter	2015-02-08 18:59:44	I did a half marathon today, but my missus pointed out that it's now called a fun-size Snickers.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-02-08 19:02:05	@CheryleFaulkner Of course. I'll point out some nice grass for them, and while they eat I'll play them the song of my people on my bassoon.

929639150	AltWhitter	2015-02-09 23:47:21	In the 1980s you could watch the test card for hours and not worry about your plasma screen getting burn-in.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-02-09 23:49:55	Also in the 1980s, most cars were rusty, and you could go out and get twatted for a fiver.

929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-03 22:38:31	@argusoncounty Did they forget to count the 405 people who had gone home or to the bar?

929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-14 23:29:34	@HealeyCartoons @barneyfarmer Gentlemen, as the country's leading cartoonists, may I pitch 'Embassy Mallard and the World of Last Thursday'?
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-14 23:32:11	@HealeyCartoons @barneyfarmer He quacks and smokes Embassies. This transports him to last Thursday where he solves crimes.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-14 23:33:26	@HealeyCartoons @barneyfarmer He pays for his fags and crime-fighting by having a pro/retrospective punt on the nags.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-14 23:35:17	@HealeyCartoons @barneyfarmer For reference, he looks a lot like Allen Ginsberg.

929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-14 23:37:58	@400FootGhost Your pics always make me slightly sad, and then afraid. Love them!

929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-13 23:27:56	@HealeyCartoons Well registered the domain sir!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-13 23:31:35	@HealeyCartoons I once registered http://t.co/rDFA6PELsf after a dream. Nothing came of it. I was to be Pica@zerorocket.co.uk
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-13 23:37:02	@HealeyCartoons The dream had a castle tower with a moon and stars behind it, and in really good text behind it 'Pica's Zero Rocket'
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-13 23:40:02	@HealeyCartoons But I once dreamed my mum payed me to write a biography of my granddad using text from Ulyses and Vico's 'The New Science'
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-13 23:46:38	@HealeyCartoons BTW, the ZeroRocket was a bit crap - vegetarian bean pie, and bananas and custard for tea, and maintenance was slack
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-13 23:47:49	@HealeyCartoons Also it didn't go very fast.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-13 23:50:25	@HealeyCartoons I'm guessing that as one of the country's leading cartoonists, you're probably not interested in a ZeroRocket strip?
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-13 23:55:28	@HealeyCartoons And the beauty of the ZeroRocket! Nowhere it can't go, no dream it can't fulfill, also it's lemon-fresh in operation.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-13 23:58:02	@barneyfarmer Pitching Pica's Zero Rocket to Lee Healy. Strip about a shit rocket where the cusine isn't great. Fear for your job, Farmer.

929639150	AltWhitter	2015-03-20 13:28:45	But if the BBC reinstates Clarkson because of popular petition, I'll accuse them of weakness and double standards. Honestly, they can't win!

929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-19 22:24:09	@Know Srsly, you need a licence to buy alcohol in a supermarket?
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-19 22:50:36	Off to bed now. All that cobblers with the jim-jams, lights off, and bagpipe noises. Balls.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-20 22:51:52	@KarlBuzz16 @b0ringtweets No! Went there for a week on a course in the 90s, and it was a dump! Mind, nowhere near as nasty as Carmarthen!

929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-21 20:45:05	@christinamartin All that's sad, but in a polite way about this country.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-21 20:52:59	Eurovision is an elision of two Greek words, euros and vision. Which means 'see piss'. Just a thought.

That's a subjunctive clause. Use this a  template. Then google 'modal operator'.
Thank you.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-22 23:09:08	Hi new following peeps, welcome to Altwhitter world. Mainly grammar, toilet humour and crossness. Enjoy and please stay!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-21 23:37:02	@Mr_Slater I agree so much I could cry! Every union meeting I attend, I put on my hobnailed boots and kick Thatcher up the arse for an hour!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-21 23:43:16	Well done #hometovote folks, you should be proud of yourselves! Backing you in spirit from Wales. #gaymarriage
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-21 23:44:56	@RuthePhoenix I'd be the size of the Isle of Wight!

929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-21 23:55:05	@RuthePhoenix Just in case, like.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-22 00:00:23	@UtopianFireman I agree so much I could cry! In job and union for 19 years, colleagues disagree or just coast on what we've done. Bastards!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-22 00:03:07	@johnfidler VG! Mind, when Warren Zevon died, Letterman was good. Loved the shows he did when Warren was dying.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-22 00:06:45	#CultProblems Sorry, misread that hashtag! Thought it said #CuntProblems and was going to moan about David Cameron. What a massive cock!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-23 19:25:56	@haveigotnews He's the prickwho rockedup in South Wales expressing admiration for Thatcher. Who fucked us over so massively. Cunts both.

929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-22 17:47:37	The Welsh Assembly Govt has awarded Assembly Members a £10K-a-year pay rise. That's 18.5%. Whilst cutting services. The greedy pricks.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-22 22:57:10	Follow my haiku-prone friend! He does a funny, much laugh. https://t.co/6yibrH2c2c

929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-22 23:18:58	Honestly, the Welsh Assembly Govt thought £54K wasn't enough, so let's give them £64K. 18.5% pay rise. Bread in the gravy, greedy arseholes.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-22 22:54:51	Me and Mrs Whit are 51, but I still think we could do the UK version of '19 Kids and Counting'. We're childless, but have a can-do attitude.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-22 22:55:59	@AngryShopMan Mine generally do. Was up to 94, now down to 88. Bastards. Follow me you tit-clowns!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-05-22 23:02:27	What if... WERE. It expresses will, desire or possibility, so the modal operator is WERE, not WAS. #keepitgoing

929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-07 17:23:32	Despite what my missus said, I could mow the front lawn in these trousers. Did a good job too. Right up to the edges. http://t.co/0Gjs0N8ahp
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-09 10:51:18	@themurenger It is. You've got wood.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-09 18:39:44	@barneyfarmer @Chantepoule What a massive, glistening cock-end. Greedy fuck-pig, bet he's not worried sick about his job and kids.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-10 06:09:33	According to the theory of neo-natal rotational dynamics, you spin me right round baby, right round.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-12 11:30:53	@LaForme80 @themurenger I dream of being on the wall in the Murenger. Sometimes I lean against them, but it's not the same.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-11 13:16:17	That Bette Midler had a tumour. Turned out she didn't, and I was the Bastard Son of Dean Friedman. #HMHB #WorstChildhoodRumors
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-12 22:18:06	Not to boast, but I've just seen the DeeTeez, the Phucks and the Oppressed. And had a few warming shandies. How has your evening been?
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-12 22:21:25	@MittenDAmour I know a few people who worked with Alex Jones in tbe 90s and apparently she doesn't wash her hands when she's had a poo.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-12 22:25:04	@vikatoyah Not to boast, but I've been out and seen 4 punk bands and had a fucking massive skinful. Going to be rough tomoz.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-11 18:21:47	@BuzzFeedUK This is a great story, thanks!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-11 18:55:06	@barneyfarmer That's an oven fire waiting to happen.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-11 18:59:38	@RuthePhoenix You've obviously never caught a beard hair in a popper on your denim shirt.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-11 19:03:37	Idea for a cartoon: Tragic Roundabout. Dougal is old and tottery. Florence takes him to the vet but returns alone. @barneyfarmer
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-11 19:06:45	@barneyfarmer You're a litigious people, you writery types. Mind I'd rob you blind, so better safe than sorry.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-11 19:09:07	@barneyfarmer Ever see a lawyer in a cheap suit?
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-11 22:14:57	@TheCrapJoker World's shittest jokes but you always brighten up my day. Thanks!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-11 22:25:37	Idea: Missing the Mule. Annette Mills looks everywhere but can't find Muffin. Missing for days, flyers on lampposts... Burger? @barneyfarmer
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 19:18:26	@EssexFBU @UtopianFireman Well done, stick it to them!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-11 22:46:23	@jdwtweet Goodnight the 'spoons, you lovely confection of brilliant beer, great food, fantastic wine and 10-year-old prices!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-11 22:52:53	@biscuitahoy I lost my little Maisie 3 years ago, and I know I'll never get over losing her. Just happy that she was my baby for 18 years.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-11 22:57:27	@biscuitahoy I wouldn't trade my years with Maisie for anything. 3 years later she makes me a better person. A tiny tabby cat!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-11 23:02:37	@biscuitahoy We now have Audrey Hepburn and Twiglett, and I love them beyond reason. They have added to the cat-love in our house.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-14 16:51:52	@UtopianFireman @Harryslaststand But my super-rich mates don't want to pay tax. Can't we just cut benefits again and punish tbe idle poor?
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-14 23:42:44	@AngryShopMan Bit like Nigella Lawson?
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-14 23:44:12	@StArnolds @BradfordBrewery Oh that sounded so good! Would have loved to been there!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-14 23:49:07	Woo-hoo 90 followers! Now, if all of you get 5 of your friends to follow me...
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 14:30:27	Socialist Party out in Cardiff today protesting the huge pay rise that MPs and the Welsh Govt have given themselves. Voice of reason.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 14:33:25	@PatrickStrud @BuzzFeedUK It's entirely reasonable to get angry about things that don't affect you and are none of your fucking business.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-12 18:29:41	@themurenger She looks exhausted. Must be all that cycling.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 14:40:15	@Tweeeeed You're a shoe man. Just seen some okay brogues in Schü for £70. Is this too cheap for nice brogues?
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 14:44:01	@Tweeeeed Cheers, that's helpful.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 14:46:13	@WYP_RPU @DruggyBuilder It's nature's way of taking stupid out of the gene pool.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 14:47:54	@govindajeggy I've got Motorhead's Iron Fist - 'you can't go on but you can't go back'
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 14:51:14	@BBCSporf Fucking hell that's nasty.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 14:56:19	@Tweeeeed Not a day passes that I'm not grateful for having gonads that turned out to be purely decorative.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 15:16:30	It's just occurred to me that I like REM. Is this normal? Not obsessed, not got everything they did, just generally.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 15:19:19	@barneyfarmer Tip: telling them that it should be 'each thing' doesn't go down well.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 15:31:12	When my brother was 5 he was sick in a swimming pool. Same sort of reception.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 15:37:31	@BadBunnyHimself Man is the only animal which doesn't eat the sick of other animals. Have we got it wrong? Is sick
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 15:38:16	@BadBunnyHimself Lovely?
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 15:42:23	@BadBunnyHimself Apols, my mistake. I'd forgotten this gem of world cinema.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 15:45:09	@BadBunnyHimself Hollywood have got it sewn up. The outsider doesn't have a chance.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 15:46:25	@BadBunnyHimself If Gwyneth Paltrow has a shit in a cup they all love it.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 15:47:33	@BadBunnyHimself Good idea. Bit quirky like the 'Making your mind up' skirt thing.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 15:52:51	Madonna has about a billion followers on Twitter, yet I follow her round New York for for 3 days and she calls the police. Double standards.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-13 18:03:04	@madonna450 Thanks for following. Being followed by Madonna, how cool is that!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-14 16:58:59	There's a bloke in my work who apparently does a willycopter when he has a piss. It's usually ankle-deep in the gents.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-14 21:28:53	@HarrisGl I misread that as BBQ and Humous. Another great evening.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-14 23:40:21	@biscuitahoy Oh! Is he your new baby?
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-15 22:05:02	@UtopianFireman I agree so much I could cry.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-15 22:20:52	@AngryShopMan I ALWAYS say pube instead of pub.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-15 21:58:33	@Jackdaw_4 When are you playing Cardiff again? You were fantastic supporting Electric Six. You should have called it the Four and Six tour.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-15 22:14:08	@PetrocTrelawny @ThePoke I recognise the tower of Cardiff City Hall, so this sign was on North Road, just across from the Marriot.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-15 22:39:12	@themurenger They must have set off on Friday, they look exhausted!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-17 20:49:14	@irowe @barneyfarmer @vizcomic ha ha, last days of Sodom and Gomorahha
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-17 21:05:05	@barneyfarmer But it was of its time. How they used to roll. Of authority now? Faceless cruelty which must be worse?
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-17 21:11:25	@kuntandthegang Look at the bellends who used to do it! Yes, you're probably right, you'll never be that kuntish.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-17 22:02:46	@AngryShopMan It's fucking wank. But the bastard advert with the woman and her go-pro toothpaste? How fucking awful is that? It's all shit.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-17 22:04:39	@CarryOnJoan Star!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-17 22:07:42	@AngryShopMan Ah, fair nuff
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-17 22:10:37	@Pundamentalism How about Cunexter Oor?
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-17 23:54:06	@History_Pics Look at that crab ladder!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-17 21:14:34	@jim20mufc @Independent Yes! Been bothering me all week! Cleo!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-17 21:18:21	@MittenDAmour Oh you're not wrong. If I could reach I'd kiss my faulty gonads each morning. I can't, also they smell like Quavers.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-18 19:43:21	@barneyfarmer Fear and Knee-Trembling by Kierkegaarse?
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-18 21:11:33	@UtopianFireman I shouldn't complain about our government. They act in my best interests. The music industry is all about the music.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-18 00:06:54	@History_Pics They ate cheese then surrendered the statue.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-18 00:18:06	@jdwtweet @The__Biscuit Out with the boss, glass of wine for her, pint for me, lush tea for two and change from a twenty! Spoon me!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-18 00:23:02	@gabrielgironda @owenphelps @twoism The plume of smoke on the left looks like a willy. Also my Javaframe is something or other. Computers!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-18 00:31:51	@_md @owenphelps Tsk. Subject continuity. Also chose an adjective which exists.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-18 20:45:59	@DanRhodes101 @barneyfarmer This money-grubbing cannot stand. I've shaken the hand of Captain Sensible and Derek Green of Sepultura there.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-18 20:47:04	@ThePoke Even Rolf Harris?
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-18 20:57:49	@vikatoyah I put a  hazelnut up my nose in the late 60s. Some intervention from mum was required.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-18 21:16:22	@southwalesargus @argusoncounty Let's hope we're not bought out by a Malaysian nut-job who will make us play in 'lucky' red!
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-18 21:38:43	@vikatoyah I'll bet. I went through a phase of putting things up my nose, including food. She once had to get a piece of beef out of there.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-18 21:44:53	@vikatoyah It was a while after lunch when I was starting to panic. She got it out with tweezers. Resourceful woman.
929639150	AltWhitter	2015-06-18 22:07:50	@vikatoyah Darwin would suggest that my brother and sister were a better bet, in evolutionary terms.
