94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-08 12:53:23	Well I had a test today... instead its just a snowday leading into spring break. #Yay
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-08 15:42:28	Yeah this snowday is cool and all, but I'm not leaving until 4:30-5 tonight. Woohoo! #Videogames #ALLDAYLONG
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-13 02:07:43	I like the rustic look of the #CONCACAF logo on tv. That "new world" idea apparently is still floating about.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-13 02:18:51	Why does it seem that there are tigres players everywhere and not as many #sounders? Maybe just me...
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-13 02:30:55	...um im curious is to how the foul against yedlin got ignored...
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-13 02:31:42	i wish i had lemonade right now. this night could be a little more enjoyable with it. #JacknLemonade
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-13 02:33:51	at least play the game tigres, don't pull a spain move... this is why americans dont like watching when all you do is PASS. #PlayFFS
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-13 02:41:38	Come on #Sounders. You have chances, make something out of them.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-13 02:43:07	#ThatAwkwardMoment when someone calls out thats really not them. thats why i was caught off guard @tayobanana
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-13 02:49:07	If you're going to do a bicycle kick, you might as well be good at it. #TheyreSupposedToBeAwesome
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-13 02:49:51	Lets see what all is in the cabinet for alcohol.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-13 02:53:20	So there's coconut rum. I'm sure I can come up with something to go with that.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-13 03:01:12	Well, if i can control how much i pour, this could be a new creation for me. Orange soda, 90 proof coconut rum.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-13 03:04:17	There it is. Tastes good too. #Hooray http://t.co/thA7dfbN4L
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-13 03:18:54	Beautiful goal @yedlinny!

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-13 23:41:29	The picture was finally uploaded. Taken from 'Rum Run" at Okemo http://t.co/HkYHooPF6o
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-14 00:01:11	Watching #TheTallMan. Sounds a lot like #TheSlenderMan mythology. I think it is. But I'll watch anyways. #NothingElseToDo
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-14 00:42:43	#TheTallMan is more or less the casual version of #TheSlenderMan. Dark hoodie, dark jeans, dark everything. And probs a mask. #ILikeThis
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-14 01:40:40	that was an interesting movie, pretty low key and meh. but interesting premise nonetheless #Slenderman
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-14 01:41:57	and that was movie #618 i've seen. #iCheckMovies

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-22 14:59:09	@REM4292 how dare they! #UseYourCrutches
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-23 03:59:26	"You're as subtle as a rhino" #ShitSeanSays
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-22 19:26:09	I will be exercising my abs today. #PreparingForEndlessLaughter
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-23 14:59:04	@jnn28jb you're very welcome :)
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-23 16:04:45	Good to hear that #USMNT played in the snow and WON. #NiceWorkFellas
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-23 17:21:04	When I first came to this island
that I called by own name
I was happy in this fortress,
in my exile I remained...
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-23 17:21:12	But the hours grew so empty
and the ocean sent her waves
In the figure of a woman
and she pulled me out to sea
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-23 18:02:04	Food paper outline. Making sure to do the introduction... #FailedOnThatLastTime
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-23 18:49:19	Learn about null and alternative hypotheses or watch #DCvCLB? Hmm, perhaps both? #Multitasker
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-23 19:50:53	Mommy is buying me girl scout cookies. Mmmm I cant wait #Tagalongs. #nommins
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-23 21:08:35	I keep seeing sports #Fanzones created via @facebook user data... ITS SO COOL! #CartographyGeek
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-23 21:10:29	Beautiful shot! #DCvCLB
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-23 21:24:14	Sooooooo CLOSE! Nice effort #DCU #DCvCLB
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-23 21:56:40	Bodies falling EVERYWHERE. #NERevs #SKC
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-26 02:04:40	Seriously considering going for a run.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-24 15:22:28	I think I might try a new type of tea today. #FeelingSomewhatAdventurous
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-24 16:02:11	Tomorrow Never Dies on tv. Today just got better. #007
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-24 16:36:27	"Oh grow up 007." -Q (Desmond Llewelyn) Another one of those awesome one-liners @jnn28jb
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-25 02:59:22	You carry me places I'd rather be
Well mannered gardens well tempered seas... #BreakingBenjamin
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-28 22:05:34	@jnn28jb There's a hashtag voice?! #PleaseElaborate #AnInquiringMindWantsToKnow
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-28 22:23:23	That's it #stats. You've been defeated once again! I will see you again soon...
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-28 22:34:23	Loud helicopter.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-25 05:21:19	Sleepy time maybe? With a side of S1 #WestWing
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-28 23:10:23	How long should I hold off having dinner? #Decisions
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-29 02:09:45	So tell me tell me, what am I do to? #ImagineDragons

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-29 02:26:44	@REM4292 if only i knew how.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-29 02:33:51	@REM4292 Yes, im a stupid boy...
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-29 02:50:09	@REM4292 i dont know how without hurting people or myself.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-29 02:53:33	@REM4292 i wouldn't know if i needed saving if it hit me in the face.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-29 03:03:17	@REM4292 lost cause or not, i'll still care. that's the truth.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-29 03:16:58	@REM4292 btw, moscato, delicious.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-29 03:19:06	@REM4292 well there's another but im keeping it fridged for jodi. I can buy some for you tomorrow

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-25 01:02:01	Oh you know, just having a feast. Complete with desert. Thanks @jnn28jb :) #YoureAwesome
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-25 13:59:05	Oh #WestWing will never get old. The sarcasm is awesome. #ThisShowIsAWESOME!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-25 14:02:08	Oh Miss Landingham, you're probably the best presidential secretary ever! #WestWing
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-26 15:08:32	My professor is going to have a field day when we finally get into the class. People need to take exams faster. #SheMightBeAngry
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-29 16:11:58	A dog just ran by my window. Hello random dog.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-26 18:35:14	Why can't I sign into @Xbox... my information is correct... #Annoyed
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-26 18:43:29	Found out the problem. If only they put that you need the "parent" email address to update security stuff for @Xbox. #MakesLifeEasier
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-26 21:34:23	just had a nice chat with mommy. Good to hear that things are continuing to look up! #Happy
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-26 21:40:48	Individually I like most of the Spanish squad, together with their tactics I dont like them. Anyone can pass a ball... #ItsWhyTheyreBoring
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-26 23:47:35	@Pres_Bartlet Thanks for the speech, I would applaud for that. #WellDone
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-27 01:25:00	Ready for the #USAvMEX game! Go #USMNT!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-27 01:39:37	I would love to see a win in Mexico, especially in #WCQ. #USAvMEX
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-29 19:23:48	Going for a stroll on this beautiful day.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-29 21:19:03	Watchin' #DoctorWho. Thanks @jnn28jb
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-25 20:31:38	successfully wasted the entire class on #SettlersOfCatan. #ImBadIKnow
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-27 03:45:13	Annnnnnnd here comes EJ! #USMNT #USAvMEX
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-27 03:47:29	Poor Beasley getting run over every two minutes or so. One of these times he'll probably be staying down unfortunately. #USMNT #USAvMEX
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-27 04:15:02	I'll take a tie, but if Brek Shea can score another here I'll take it. #USMNT #USAvMEX
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-27 04:17:09	More bodies in the goal. Same guy too! #USAvMEX
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-27 04:25:49	One of the most exciting 0-0 games I've watched. #USMNT #USAvMEX
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-25 22:58:43	The other twin is hanging out right now. Try again later.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-25 23:31:12	Oh you know, just hanging out at work. I should be working on my paper but we're having a great time! #NotLeavingYet
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-27 17:03:28	To keep me complacent, You knock me down with a smile. #Seether
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-31 16:00:37	Someone gave me alcohol. This will be fun #Mamosas
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-31 19:38:57	Mommy's stuck in the dark corner of animal videos on youtube. #SheSaysThisIsNormal @bcaito14
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-26 01:34:04	#CupOfNoodles then time to write that paper and do stats homework. Oh, I don't like proxies. Just thought I'd throw that out there.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-26 20:58:07	Helping @tayobanana with #Excel because im the #ExcelWhiz. #AllInADaysWork
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-27 05:08:15	Time to finish this paper. Not due til Thursday, but I've gots #Stats to do too. #ExtremeProcrastinator
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-27 05:08:42	Not to mention these I've also had 2-3 weeks to work on... yeah.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-27 05:09:24	And its tweet fifteen hundred.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-30 06:10:21	You got me feeling sublime, I want to yell it from the rooftops down #Seether
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-30 08:18:58	Im going to be quite the nuisance tomorrow if I can't sleep tonight...wait... yup suns not up yet. #MightPullAllNighter
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-01 01:04:56	And...here...we...go #GameOfThrones
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-28 13:05:30	@jnn28jb its okay, it really is. There will be other times
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-27 07:20:03	Its 3:19, I've finished my #GeographyofFood store paper. Time to sleep if at all possible. #MightHaveAHeadache
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-01 02:37:53	I don't know what to think. To say im worried is an understatement.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-30 17:54:01	Oh just being an office slave for the next hour or so. #SonOfAnAccountant #MoneyMoneyMoney
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-27 16:15:15	To be honest, if Mexico played better than the #USMNT, they would've won. Their play was sloppy, especially in the final third.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-27 16:17:06	But on a completely different note, breaking out the shorts today. #ItsBeautifulOutside
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-30 18:29:07	I'm looking at all these forms and I'm thinking "Is this really all necessary?" Seems like there's a form for EVERYTHING! #Madness
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-30 19:32:12	So if you're saying if I was a really good player, captain etc... then took a break where I fell off the radar, first game back id be capt?
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-30 19:35:24	Interesting news: Im probably getting the current #Flagship. Also means #Bear is being handed off to @bcaito14. #Upgrading
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-30 19:40:15	@bcaito14 graduation! #ImExcitedToo
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-27 20:23:17	Drew a new #map today. Complete with physical features, political boundaries, and place names. Just being me unrestrained. #UsedClassWell
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-01 16:43:14	Red Sox #BBTNVOTE
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-01 16:48:06	Best part of today: #RedSox #OpeningDay. Nothing else is too great about it
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-01 16:55:50	@jnn28jb Yeah, didn't even notice the playdoh there
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-01 17:35:35	Didn't realize Gomes is as big as he is... but nice line-drive. #RedSox
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-01 17:39:42	Nice job #RedSox.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-01 17:41:57	40th pitch in 2 innings? Awesome. And 2 more runs. #RedSox 3-0
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-28 01:29:21	Uh oh. I'm hungry... I might go get some noms soon.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-28 04:16:33	@jnn28jb I went back after and got stuff some noms, no worries #NotHungryAnymore
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-28 04:56:03	@jnn28jb you were tired though, i felt bad keeping you
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-28 15:28:51	Forgot my name on the test. Remembered just in time. Might be one of "those" days. #TodayWillBeFun
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-28 16:33:59	James hall seems to always be on the chilly side. #shivering
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-28 17:16:16	@jnn28jb oh well. #JustAStupidBoy
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-28 18:13:26	In my room for the next few hours... I would really wish for a way to get out of this stats homework. #IHateYouStats
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-02 00:10:13	Oh just fooling around with the #TreasureMap mode on #GoogleMaps. Its fascinating... #GeekingOut
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-03 20:11:38	Test: Done. #Stats homework: In progress. #IHateYouStatsHomework

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-04 00:37:37	I turn on the #RedSox game to find them winning 6-0. Good job, but it's early yet. #OneSixtyGamesToGo
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-04 00:45:02	Rachel is having none of this "I'm cold" bullshit. This is while she occasionally looks up at the #RedSox game. #FunnyStuff @REM4292
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-02 18:24:13	I managed to kill my phone's battery during one class. Even participated in class a decent amount. #RomanCiv #Multitasker
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-28 19:48:08	I hate you #stats.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-03-28 19:52:18	Fuck this, im taking a nap.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-04 06:16:06	Walking down main street and we see the traffic cones blocking it off. Interesting... someone had fun. @REM4292
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-05 19:05:42	Now what to do? #bored
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-05 20:49:46	I thought about going for a walk, but a nap sounds better. #lazy
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-03 21:14:43	Oh #stats, you were so easy this week. Time to finish up responses for another class.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-06 02:56:04	@jnn28jb Weird... free orange nonetheless haha
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-06 03:06:46	@jnn28jb free food is free food :)
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-04 23:46:07	Itll be nice if I can walk later. Ankles and knees are killing me. #DamnLooseLigaments
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-05 00:22:36	@REM4292 yeah, ill probably just want to sit and drink.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-06 03:42:08	I think this bag of doritos is going to be gone by the time i go to bed. #noms
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-07 17:20:54	Off to a good start #RedSox. Let's keep it going.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-07 18:20:23	Well looks like its @middlebrooks' day today. Go #RedSox
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-07 18:38:01	Okay #BlueJays, you won 5-0 yesterday. The #RedSox raise you 8-0 and only in the 5th inning.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-06 16:30:38	Oh just workin alone. #bored
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-08 00:28:51	I should be doing homework, but #WhoseLine sounds way more entertaining. #CantFocus
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-08 02:03:29	Missed the first showing of #GameOfThrones. I'm not worried, #HBO does encores.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-08 02:31:21	@jnn28jb Well that too, but I know it plays again immediately after so it works out
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-06 21:18:23	Think I might just sit around for the night. Not much will to do anything else. #ThatMehFeeling
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-06 23:28:02	If people need me, call. Good chance im sleeping #TheTiredHasOvercomeMe
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-08 02:57:40	With every single memory of the good or bad faces of luck, don't lose any sleep tonight, I'm sure everything will end up alright #Audioslave
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-08 03:00:07	If I performed surgery on my lindt white chocolate bunny, i probably could have stuffed it with the other white chocolate bunny. #RandomThot
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-08 03:02:32	Better yet, I could have filled it with the miniature cadbury eggs. #ChocolateDeviant
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-07 01:57:51	My formal drink: Long Island Iced Tea. Informal: Jack and lemonade of some form. #FunFact
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-08 05:00:50	Reading... hard to believe but it's happening. #Bored
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-09 01:28:18	Just went over what escargot is and instantly yelled out: "SNAILS!" I hope this question is on the test. #FingersCrossed
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-09 01:34:09	@REM4292 oh okay. i actually shouldn't say anything because i haven't had snail so... #ImmaBeQuiet
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-07 04:07:18	Yep. I'm treated like a dog. Loyal and there when you call, then dismissed when I do anything wrong. #ThisIsMyLife
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-07 04:58:28	Time for some #WestWing. I think I'll be up for awhile.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-08 15:07:29	To open the geoengineering lecture/discussion my professor played the theme song to bob the builder. #ThatJustHappened
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-08 18:00:44	Its alright, I enjoy pain from my ankles up to my knees. No big deal. #JustAmputateIt
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-09 04:24:04	@jnn28jb just that one time but wasn't exactly in the mood for it so stopped talkin to 'em
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-08 19:02:42	My tolerance for being sworn at is very low today. Good chance I wont want to talk if im going to get sworn at. #kThanks
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-08 22:05:28	That feeling that you'll explode if someone texts/talks to you. #ItsHowImFeeling #YouAreNotPrepared
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-09 20:02:18	Yes, its Tuesday. Yes, I have class tomorrow. Yes, I would like to hang out with people I normally don't. #DrinkingTonight #WhyNot
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-12 02:22:02	Meh. Looks like I'll be bored tonight. #OhWell
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-12 02:30:05	Kinda frustrated. I shouldn't be, but I am. Time to fall into the weekend of stress. #PERFECT
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-13 22:15:54	“@ZodiacAreUs: #Scorpio don't stalk, They investigate.” Is this how you see it @jnn28jb? =)
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-13 22:55:18	Exercising the #ExcelWhiz in me. Only time I enjoy #Stats....
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-14 02:01:34	Oh just hammering out this #Stats paper. Got all my results, just fearing the whole explaining part. #Argh. #TooConciseForThis
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-04-11 00:15:48	Another #stats homework done. And probably finishing the one for this week on friday. Time to work on my project... #Noooo

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-05-18 00:56:47	@REM4292 Yeah... I don't think my phone likes me anymore and called it quits. #Argh
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-05-18 01:03:08	@REM4292 Tell me about it. Anyways, I'm bored. Just about unpacked and dunno what to do. #Bleh

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-05-16 21:47:03	@REM4292 you bet I would. And I think you'd respond "but jose is my friend!"
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-05-16 23:01:46	Hetzel has been abandoned. Only 6 remain. #MoveOut

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-05-19 03:51:31	Must have been a miscommunication on the #SoundersFC behalf, but nice goal for #FCDallas regardless. Its a game 2-1 #SEAvDAL
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-05-19 04:32:30	Okay #SoundersFC you are making your case. You beat the first place team with an exciting match, thank you. #SEAvDAL 4-2

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-05-19 16:32:02	"What do you want to do, send in the cartographers?!" Yes.. please do, it would be excellent. #WestWing
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-05-19 16:35:37	The bond between Bartlet and Charlie was unbelievable in #WestWing, probably one of the best running subplots in the show.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-05-19 19:35:38	I need a teleporter. #FairDemand
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-05-17 23:50:43	If I knew my name wasn't being called I wouldn't have wanted people to go. Hell I wouldn't even be walking if I knew this. #Frustrated
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-05-18 01:05:43	@REM4292 bahaha nice. Bridget comes in my room occasionally and sunshine apparently has been daring and going downstairs! #Daredevil

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-05-20 01:00:23	This is me being a good friend, in order for @REM4292 to watch #GameOfThrones, I'm turning my laptop towards the TV for her to watch.

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-05-23 01:58:26	So I have this broken teleporter, and it's really starting to be aggravating when I want to go somewhere but I can't... #OhWell

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-02 02:39:04	#ChivasUSA, best example for a team to be relocated. Failed experiment in my opinion. #JustSayin'
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-02 03:11:58	Uh...wrong goal? #CHVvSEA
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-01 20:49:00	While I look out upon this magnificent vista... ahem, Downtown Durham, I contemplate a proposal that would be financially good for me. #hmmm
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-03 21:29:11	Today's been pretty low-key. #SimCity for the first half of the day, #WiiFit for a bit, ran with @bcaito14 then got my check. #MyMonday
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-03 01:59:16	Today has been full of surprises. First, #USMNT triumph of #GER. Then #GoT. #NowWhatToDo?

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-18 02:15:52	They still call weekly maintenance "Breaking News"? It should be called a "Reminder" @Warcraft
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-18 04:25:09	On a 7 win streak so far for #ESPN #StreakForTheCash. Being very careful and sure of my picks. For example, no #WCQ, anything can happen.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-18 13:57:54	Oh today is a good day. 2 #RedSox games and #USAvHON in #WCQ. Whoopee! #Excited
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-18 15:29:10	Okay, first 2 are the same, last 3 are well the worst. It's a scramble somewhere in the middle. This is what I do for fun. #ImLame
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-19 00:27:08	Waiting for this NBA stuff to move on. I want #WCQ! I'm ready for #USAvHON. GO #USMNT!

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-19 02:39:15	Good day so far. 6 hours of excel work done, #RedSox win both games today, and #USMNT are winning in #RioT over Honduras. #USAvHON
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-19 03:08:48	#USMNT ranked 28th in #FIFA/Coca-Cola #WorldRanking. Pretty sure that's not including tonights win in #RioT
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-19 03:28:25	Time to watch #Skins. Why? Because its pretty awesome. That's why. #Truth

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-17 05:42:31	Feeling relieved somewhat. Not sure what to do now. Work and save money sounds like a good idea. #GamePlan

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-18 03:23:48	I need to stop thinking. Thinking is bad. Very very bad. #ContagiousThoughts
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-06-18 15:18:00	Comparing the #PowerRankings between @ESPNFC and @MLS. The differences are drastic. #Interesting...

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-02 14:35:33	Sadly, I've enjoyed my self-imposed silence. Right now I think it's best if I only talk if talked to. #ItsHowItsGoingToBe
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-09 01:34:49	I had no idea Mark Hamill was a voice actor for The Joker in one of the newer Batman games. #InterestingTidbit
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-09 01:35:54	One of the best voice acting jobs has got to go to Martin Sheen as #TheIllusiveMan in the #MassEffectTrilogy.

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-10 03:21:34	Nice first goal for the #USMNT from #Wondo. Then again, #Belize is ranked 130 worldwide. #USAvBLZ
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-11 05:56:28	Watched some #Newsroom today. I still sit astounded by genius that is Sorkin. I will occasionally go back to #WestWing episodes. #SorkinFan
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-14 02:54:15	Listening to the commentators...and how can that shot be "nearly magical" when @MGspurning was facing the sun? That was a magical SAVE.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-14 02:58:31	Another MAGICAL save from @MGspurning. I know its home field advantage, but the sun is a major disadvantage. Fix yo shit SJ
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-14 03:08:31	I think I might get a headache from the play-by-play commentator for the @SJEarthquakes. Yikes, reminds me of a squeaky toy a dog has.

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-20 18:40:52	When someone says to me (well @REM4292) cleaning birds, all that comes to mind is a very angry duck being dunked in water #FunnyToThinkAbout
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-18 05:10:50	Uh. Yeah, #BourneSupremacy, sleep eventually. Work 11-close tomorrow. #Wooo #Exhausted
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-21 16:25:39	Now when they say "sold out" do they mean the entire stadium or just the lower bowl? #Hopeful #ButAlsoRealist
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-21 20:17:20	Seems like there is no flow to this game and when there's even a hint some type of whistle is blown. #USAvSLV #USMNT
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-21 20:21:58	Ooooh totally blew that shot. Would've and should've been a beauty of a goal #USMNT #USAvSLV
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-21 20:25:49	On a side note, El Salvador's players fall easily. Prepare yourself for a lot of bogus calls. #USMNT #USAvSLV
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-21 20:32:23	Nice saves rimando! #USMNT
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-21 20:34:05	What? One of their players fell and didn't get a call? Weird. #USMNT

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-07-28 22:04:37	Nice job #USMNT. Little sketchy near the end but the job was done. @BrekShea got the last word in that fiasco. #EnjoyableEnd

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-08-03 19:56:50	@AlexiLalas I'm not huge fan of LD but for what he's done and skill level, they should earn the same but somewhere in the middle of the 2
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-08-04 05:39:00	It is not a step back, it is a step forward for US Soccer. Seeing a major US Soccer star playing in the States is best for the league. #MLS
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-08-05 01:44:32	Not in the mood for #Newsroom tonight. Not really in the mood for anything. Just how its been recently. #ItIsWhatItIs

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-08-07 12:54:50	I mean really? Teheran hit Harper? Give me a break, Big Papi would do the same if he hit a shot like that, get used to it. #BaseballRant

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-08-17 05:21:14	Because sending a tweet to someone is just as sketchy as fb messaging someone. #Yikes #NotThatOutOfIt

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-08-27 01:41:15	Tonight, I was reminded of why people like me. I'm a good person (most of the time) and go out of my way to help my friends. #ItsWhoIAm
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-08-27 01:43:09	I was also reminded that I have an extensive support group standing by my side when things get tough. I extend that belief to my friends.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-08-27 01:44:23	I may not always show that, but I am. I'm lucky to have my family and my friends. #JustAPassingThought #OrTwo

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-08-31 17:11:25	Lemonade and whiskey tonight. #BecauseICan
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-08-31 19:08:30	I usually try to impress, but you've caught me at a bad time. I'm not sure what I should do anymore.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-02 15:51:09	Gong to #Candia with mommy and @bcaito14. Suddenly rain. I love the rain.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-01 03:08:20	Well #SoundersFC won tonight despite being down a man. And this tweet would've been short a few d's if I had a few more drinks. #Facts
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-01 03:11:24	And I bid thee farewell...for now. #StuffToDo #NotReally
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-01 03:47:53	First time in awhile I've laughed for no reason. Im on the edge. #LoveThisFeeling

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-01 04:46:57	So happy I was able to get a second reference. I want three. Next question, Pittsburgh or DC area? #Hmmm #SeeWhatHappens
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-01 14:02:02	@jnn28jb #redsox won big last night and #rays are trying to keep up

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-01 14:28:26	Well Henry sure knows how to pick clubs to buy. Exciting game to watch between #LFC and #ManU. Onto #Arsenal and #Tottenham
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-01 15:04:35	I still laugh when I hear Lloris' (pronounced Loris) name. All I can think about is the slow loris. #ItsFunny
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-01 15:23:29	That was a beautiful goal. Nice job #Arsenal.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-01 16:59:32	And wishing good luck to #Bear, who will be in Keene for a little while. Side note: #TheFlagship/#Legion is mine for the same duration.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-08-29 23:56:41	Here I am watching the last preseason game for the pats.... if I wanted a scoreless game after half an hour of watching, I'd watch soccer...
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-08-29 23:58:15	Wait a second. I'd rather watch a soccer game than this "football." So much for big scores huh? #Facepalm
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-02 20:48:49	PUDDLES!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-08-30 03:19:19	Watching #Suits before bed...whenever that happens. Day off tomorrow!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-08-30 03:25:37	Not scoring many points with the opposite sex this week. Feeling stupid lately so yeah. #WillSpeakWhenSpokenTo
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-01 23:16:23	Off to the movies. And it looks like I'm going to Florida between Christmas and New Years. #Coolio
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-02 02:45:34	I need new pencils. I've lost my pencils! I can't draw my maps without pencils #SadFace

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-02 04:05:29	Catching up night 2. #LowWinterSun is up. Might need to move onto #Netflix next to get #HellOnWheels caught up.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-02 22:14:21	Watching #VForVendetta. Yuppers
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-05 18:02:21	Beat the #Catan campaign again on my #Droid. Last scenario only took 1 attempt. #GreatSuccess

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-06 00:29:40	I want to laugh uncontrollably tonight for no good reason. Whiskey it is.

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-06 03:13:44	Look after yourself, and care for others. Seldom let someone care form you. Don't make it a "you owe me" deal.

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-04 03:38:20	1 of the hairdressers called me a traitor tonight for not going to them to get my hair cut. Id rather drink whiskey during my haircut thanks
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-03 00:19:07	It was nice knowing you green #RedSox hat. Looks like you couldn't survive the washer.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-06 14:14:53	Haha, its 56 out right now. And I'm going to Rye today. Bahaha. I love the cold. #Layers
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-07 01:37:40	As my off day between work, it has seemed like an entire weekend has happened, that's how long it was today. And I'm feeling better.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-07 01:39:23	Better, but still feeling like Ive lost a part of myself. Not how I envisioned these past two weeks to happen but it's how it goes I suppose
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-07 02:13:41	They're running all over you #USMNT. Get your shit together or its going to be 5-0 at half.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-06 15:48:49	I could never imagine what it would be like to live away from the ocean. It soothes me. Makes me feel like nothing matters.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-07 02:14:40	Slow them down. Make them play against you not for them.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-03 02:46:31	Unlike most, when I'm stressed, I don't eat because I feel sick. I also have a severely messed up eating schedule. #OhWell
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-04 15:11:45	Day 2 of musical cars. Today: the #Highlander. #ThereCanOnlyBeOne
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-06 19:03:18	Watching #WCQ ENGvMOL. So far tied at 0-0.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-07 03:38:41	Can't watch anymore. Even with 4 of the #USMNT top goal scoring players on the field. Costa Rica was all over them.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-04 17:32:25	@kato_888 so far just the accord and highlander
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-03 17:13:53	Musical cars this week. Nothing like driving a different car everyday to work. #ItHappens
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-04 19:34:45	There are some people I can read their attitude through their texts. Others its impossible. Pretty sure I can be the same way sometimes.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-04 21:02:10	Auxiliary cord doesn't work. That's okay, I'll use Bluetooth. #FirstWorldProbs
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-08 04:01:29	Damn. Those brunettes!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-08 04:12:09	She reminds me of someone from home.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-08 05:17:38	Definitely had a lot of fun. More than I've had in a while. If only I had acted sooner. #TryToKillMyMoodNow #IDareYou
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-04 23:43:50	Bridges are friendships. And lately I've been burning them down faster than they're being built.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-05 02:01:53	#SoundersFC soon. Wait...now? Maybe?
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-05 02:10:51	Oh, Highlander again tomorrow. Btw, sorry I didn't act sooner. Its more or less habit for me.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-05 03:35:44	My haircut makes me look 'sophisticated' apparently. It is clean but I can style it kinda to be more soccer player-esque #PlannedIt

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-10 02:41:55	Well, here is the end of my rather fantastic weekend. Here's to a good week! #FeelingMuchBetter
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-10 04:11:50	I've got two applications ready to press send. Unfortunately one might need a cover letter and I'll need to look around to see how.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-10 04:34:07	When did #TheBreakfastClub get on @Netflix? Well I know at least someone that would be estatic about that.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-10 04:42:30	Think I need to get out more often. Still can't get over how much fun I had. #3DaysAfter
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-11 02:01:32	#USMNT! awesome finish!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-09 14:08:47	One of my professors said I should take time before I start my career, and do something different. But a career is something different.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-07 22:21:14	After going back and forth on my decision, I'll go have a good time tonight seeing #HarshArmadillo at #TheStoneChurch with friends from work

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-12 00:15:19	Kinda want to get froyo but don't want to go alone. Some other time I guess #wah
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-12 16:22:14	@SSFC_Rumors everyone knows the FIFA rankings are crap
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-12 18:25:09	Nothing like trying out potential foods for the store. #FreeNoms #TastyNoms
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-12 19:00:37	The moment you realize that someone in your guild is an extremely attractive woman. Games belong to everyone!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-13 14:43:04	Oh. Today is the 13th? Well, it is what it is. I miss my black cat.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-12 23:25:35	I suppose "friend hunting" isn't the same as "friend searching" is it? One seems rather forced. #RandomThought
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-13 00:26:01	And they thought the rain was going to stop....naw. it keeps going! #LoveTheRain
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-13 22:16:12	They told us to pick seats but when we tell them which ones they're like "no." @bcaito14 #JustLetItBe
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-11 20:41:05	@ChrisMills66 not alone on that one. It is ridiculously stupid
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-14 15:03:29	Tired and kinda grouchy. Mask on today for the customers. But for those who wish to piss me off, today is not that day.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-15 00:42:14	Settle down and sit with me
Let me tell you how this all came to be

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-14 01:45:59	I would've been happy about a double, but I'll take a #GrandSlam. #RedSox #FearTheBeard

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-15 22:27:56	Stories and such with Aunt Barbara, Mommy, and @bcaito14. #FunTimes
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-14 02:50:01	Did that #RSL player have a seizure on the ground? 25th minute...
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-14 02:51:14	@LIVESounders Thanks for the hillarious play-by-play, I thoroughly enjoy it!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-14 03:02:58	Did @yedlinny and @LamarNeagle just go fishing? Regardless, beautiful cross and a beautiful goal!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-14 03:43:15	#Dempsey Time. Here. We. Go. #SoundersFC
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-17 02:49:35	Just started my #Barbarian on @Diablo. Rend and walk around. Loot. Rinse and repeat
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-16 00:13:21	You know you lost someone important when your family asks if that person has talked to you. If I knew why I would say so but I don't.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-16 00:56:54	If you just meet with me I can explain. I can explain why I am the way I am. Just give me the chance.

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-14 04:53:30	And my knee hurts. Go figure. Woo go loose ligaments. #MyLife
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-17 12:55:44	I woke up and my first thought? "What kind of mess can I get myself into today..." #Yikes
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-18 02:26:27	Yay. Got a quick tutorial on how to look for new tires and looks like I'm going tomorrow to schedule it. #Yay #GottaPassInpection
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-18 18:31:25	@kato_888 well some money but not as much as you...just tires for me #IThink
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-20 02:48:23	Bought Dad dinner and more golf balls. #FeedingHisHabits #PunIntended #HappyBirthdayDad
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-20 14:35:37	So Bear is getting 2 new paws. Its been an expensive week. Going to try not to buy much next week with my card, gotta save. #FrugalMode
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-20 14:38:03	Never mind, make that 4 new paws for #Bear #Yikes
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-20 19:22:06	Just heard that a deep space craft was run over by a comet. #InterplanetaryRoadkill
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-18 19:20:56	@kato_888 yeah. Luckily I only need 2 tires and not all 4. Though 4 new tires would be nice
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-18 19:23:49	Sorry Bale... I still think you aren't worth that ridiculous transfer fee...
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-18 21:43:51	Its awesome to have someone to talk futbol/soccer with. #WorkIsSoMuchEasierNow
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-18 22:02:10	Looks like I might need another paper towel and duct tape bandage! Managed to get myself good with the frialator. #YayBurns #NotReally
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-17 02:01:08	Listening to @STS9 for a change of pace. #MixingItUp #SorryRockGenre
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-21 01:56:53	Batters don't need to be given time. It's their fault they or the runner isn't ready. You want to speed up the game? Stop giving batter time
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-21 01:57:53	and on the flip side, pitchers need to also be speedier so time doesn't need to be asked for... #WishfulThinking #2PartTweet

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-21 04:22:26	16 games is not a long season... please. Try 162 games with the occasional day off...
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-19 00:24:26	So good at this game!

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-19 15:09:09	Oh cool a short day at work today... I got a whole 4 hours off because I wanted to have dinner with Dad for his birthday.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-21 22:28:25	I knew she was a Fosher!

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-22 03:41:34	Well it's been quite a game. #SoundersFC need to see runs better and get on the same page. #LAvSEA
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-24 21:41:46	Well looks like I'll have to avoid looking on twitter when 8pm rolls around. #PremierWeek #1stWorldProblems
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-25 00:12:48	There are some people that are a pillar of happiness and make you smile by just looking at you. One perk of my job is I'm a recipient of it.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-25 01:00:26	I'm not loitering I swear. Just waiting for my ride...

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-25 02:18:09	@kato_888 well the list is decent but just as I finished it he showed up
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-25 20:03:02	@bcaito14 hahaha. Of course it is. #PreTC
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-26 17:53:09	Last day of the weeeeeeek! #WhoopWhoop #BaltimoreTomorrow!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-23 02:38:09	Think it's time to find more people to talk to. Just trying to keep myself occupied more and more
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-26 01:57:33	Mmm. Just got the jeep back and I took a then and now something doesn't sound right. Well this week is certainly getting worse...
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-26 22:02:46	Major burn marks on my left hand/wrist. They aren't self inflicted, I swear!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-26 22:05:37	I guess not major but they're quite numerous and some larger than others.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-23 15:32:28	Well today just got shitty. Good thing I'm not a big spender...
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-23 17:22:02	@kato_888 Looks like #Bear needed more work than anticipated. Go figure. Let's just say I'll be just about broke when its paid for.

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-27 23:15:40	For the record, I didn't consider you "one of the guys" but my closest of friends. There were other times I wish you were more. #Truth
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-27 23:19:23	Actually not just some of the time, but most of the time. But now I miss talking to you and nothing is quite the same.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-27 23:56:28	31st floor? Sure @bcaito14 http://t.co/40Mm9k4nr7
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-27 23:57:47	Yup. Looks and feels like the 31st floor http://t.co/DlzpPoawgF
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-09-28 15:57:12	Part of my people watching experience is to listen to them talk. Then I wonder where they are from. #ItsWhatIDo

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-02 20:01:18	Working alone a whole day sucks. In case you didn't know.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-02 21:44:28	Maybe she'll come back and get her baklava since she forgot it. Plus talking to her again would be nice. #PleaseComeBack
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-03 02:54:08	Well... Unless the #Indians show some muscle and score some runs, looks like my #RedSox will be fighting off those pesky #Rays. #BringIt

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-12 20:28:03	There's not one....but TWO passed out girls at my work right now. #SleepyTime
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-08 22:32:42	Managed to burn myself TWO more times in less than 10 minutes. Left thumb and left wrist (right next to the last couple). #MyLuck
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-10 00:02:15	Ffffff burned myself pretty good this time. Left thumb. Its gunna look pretty tomorrow! #LuckyMe

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-16 18:50:42	I see #Mini Countryman. I want #Mini Countryman. Or a #Subaru XV Crosstrek. #Dreaming
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-16 19:55:41	Unfortunate to see Gomes out of the lineup. Its something about him that gives the extra effect. On the flip side, another S hitter is good.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-16 19:57:23	On a personal note, my thumb looks better! http://t.co/HlZp71htig

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-17 00:03:13	Detroit, you front loaded your batting order. I don't think that was a good idea...
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-14 01:55:12	To whoever said a strikeout doesn't have a chance of failure, it does. The catcher has the same chance any other position player does. #SMH
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-14 03:24:11	Its a tie game #RedSox ! #Bel13ve
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-17 02:42:10	Of course a top-heavy lineup would've only been beneficial to the #RedSox if Peavy pitched more effectively.

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-27 04:20:33	The #RedSox have beat the odds before, they can do it again. Look at it this way, the umpiring is now even footed. And see the closer better

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-28 22:28:58	Welp. #RedSox need to pull off a W tonight. #AC4BlackFlag out tomorrow, getting that before work. Training someone new tomorrow night. #yay
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-29 02:42:22	@kato_888 he thinks jonny gomes looks like a hobbit
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-30 15:25:29	Feeling useful today. I setup the internet at work all by myself! Beats actually working... #ChangeInRoutine
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-31 02:07:06	What's the #Cardinal's mercy call? Wacha...wacha....wacha. @NOTSCMLB
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-31 02:57:04	#RedSox! #RedSox! #RedSox! That's definitely worth 3 hashtags! 6 more outs!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-31 03:02:32	"Something tells me you've already had a lot of candy." #GreatCommercials
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-31 03:24:05	That's 3 #WorldSeries wins in my lifetime for the #RedSox!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-31 03:50:54	And of course he deserved the #WorldSeriesMVP: @davidortiz
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-30 17:42:42	@kato_888 nope. Always stole internets from others
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-03 02:20:59	I'm ready! Go @SoundersFC ! #SEAvPOR http://t.co/wso4gJbZuQ
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-01 05:14:03	Caught my first #GreatWhite in #AC4BlackFlag!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-31 17:37:02	Overtime next week. Yippee! Yay for big orders that require more time! #MoneyMoneyMoney
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-30 22:35:53	Just submitted my first "real" job application. Time to wait. Hopefully I'm not super busy when they call...
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-30 22:44:01	Wacha is the obstacle. But maybe he'll do what Sanchez did and pull a 180. Anyways, go #RedSox! #WorldSeries
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-30 23:57:02	Now that #Jeopardy is over, time for #Game6. Go #RedSox! #WorldSeries
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-31 01:29:16	We own you wacha
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-10-31 01:30:50	Same thing we did to Sanchez
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-01 13:42:03	I like this mentor in #AC4BlackFlag. Native Americans rock!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-01 20:59:58	Haha, Death of a Salesman achievement. Nice tribute. #AC4BlackFlag
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-04 23:16:45	Apparently in order for her to eat her dinner, I have to watch her... #WeirdDog http://t.co/VNppTJTSXk
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-06 01:27:38	I could've taken the easy way out and given up on doing what I want. But I don't want to. I want to make maps and whatnot!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-05 20:30:56	Today is the 5th of November. In tribute, I give you V's introductory speech to Evey from the movie #VforVendetta http://t.co/WQYJO8DwZF
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-07 03:54:52	For a league that doesn't have many good first touches, THAT goal by #SKC was a good first touch. #SKCvNE
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-08 04:23:08	I still don't like the neon blue kits. Sorry, it just doesn't work for me. Rave green or slate are my favs. #SoundersFC
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-08 05:09:47	Yeah, good luck #SoundersFC. You got to the playoffs, but you need some serious work with passing.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-10 14:28:07	Sunderland scores....? #Wow
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-10 15:58:51	Nice job by Sunderland to keep ManCity at bay. #Impressive
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-07 20:41:50	Oh so it's cloudy and not DST? Perfect, it's dark at 3:41p. Just perfect. #ButItsTooEarly
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-07 20:45:20	Curious, so if a potential job description misspells a leading software name, should I spell it the right way or spell it the way they want?
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-07 20:48:44	Or is it a trick to make me notice?! #ContinuedFromLast
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-07 21:08:13	Found this nifty tool for #GTAOnline http://t.co/6hTo1EXGXR #GoogleEarth style!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-07 21:09:13	Whenever #TheKing responds to something on #fb, I think "He has spoken."
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-07 21:52:23	Feeling pretty good about myself right now. 2 more job applications submitted. #Yippee
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-10 21:44:48	@amberglassman like me yesterday!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-08 20:13:14	Totally called the jump from 90-100. This is the end. The last expansion. #JustSaidIt
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-11 16:46:26	To all those who have served and sacrificed in the armed forces of our country, thank you. #VeteransDay
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-09 19:51:16	If play like you did against the #NERevs, you should do well. I'm pulling for you, #SKC. #MLSPlayoffs
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-09 19:53:50	Also a slight grudge against #Dynamo for beating the #NERevs twice in the finals causes me to root for the other team. #MLSPlayoffs
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-12 01:40:32	I have no idea what to do, so I'm sitting here doing nothing. Well other than sending this tweet.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-12 22:39:00	You want to know what I want for presents? I don't even know what I want...that's reasonable.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-13 01:10:57	Vacating Twitter while #AgentsofSHIELD is on. Laters.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-10 00:43:33	I think I just made someone's night by telling them how late work is open tonight. She sounded so happy. #LittleThings
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-10 00:50:24	Oh and I think I know the 4 other MLS expansion clubs. In order of induction: Orlando, Atlanta, San Antonio, Minneapolis. #JustMy2cents
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-13 13:08:56	Nothing like waking up to a headache! #WellThen

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-17 01:11:11	Oh goody, its 8. Did 7 even happen?
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-16 00:35:38	*Bridget growling* #TheKing says "This is why they don't allow dogs in movie theatres" @bcaito14
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-16 02:48:56	I know rumors are rumors, but if Ellsbury goes to the Mariners, I don't think he will see another playoff run in the near future. #Part1
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-16 02:50:07	The Angels will wake up, Texas will put up the usual fight for the playoffs. And plus, the Red Sox have the money. #Part2
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-16 02:51:56	For the Red Sox, bring back Youk on a 1 year for 3rd, Bogaerts to SS, Nap at 1st. Get Salty back w/Ross as backup. BOS has the money. #Part3
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-17 16:45:48	Having breakfast at an Irish themed restaurant and all I can think of the music is #AC4BlackFlag. #GamerProblems

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-19 19:46:36	Congrats to Ozzie Alonso for his promotion of sorts to Designated Player! #SoundersFC
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-19 19:47:26	Go #USMNT! Getting my updates from...well I think 3 sources on Twitter.
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-19 19:57:30	Oh, its #GeographyAwarenessWeek! @Sporcle quizzes here I come!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-19 20:02:48	First up and completed: Matching 2-Word country names. I had 20 seconds left. (No mouse!)
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-19 20:04:22	Hehe, they favorited my tweet. Onwards to the next quiz!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-19 20:49:07	#OCFC 21st team. Totally called it. Next up...Miami. As much as I don't think they can get the fan support...
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-19 20:50:44	From last tweet, that's Orlando City SC. My bad. #OCSC**
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-19 21:58:26	I think it might be time to extend my search. Found 2 in GA looking for what I want to do. Outside ATL? Hmmm....
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-20 00:59:05	I knew they were next after NYCFC. You deserve this @OrlandoCitySC #MLS21
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-20 03:24:27	I need to watch #DavidBlaine more often. This is cool!
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-24 02:58:02	Congrats #SKC on their win. #EastConfChamps
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-20 18:36:42	I don't think it'll happen....MLS in Miami 2.0

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-27 18:06:46	I feel no guilt in talking about the negativity of #TheCrownPrince when making plans. It almost feels like a coup d'etat. #FancyWord

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-11-27 20:24:14	Whoever says they are thankful there isn't snow in the Northeast right now, snow is a wonderful thing that should be embraced with open arms

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-12-03 21:46:32	I haven't impulse bought anything in awhile. But I liked the coat. It was super comfy and had lots of pockets. My gift to myself this year.

94620632	ThomCaito	2013-12-06 17:19:22	Portugal, #USMNT, Ghana, and Germany. It could've been better but it could've also been much much worse. #WorldCupDraw

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-01 19:26:08	Tottenham win? Nice. They're looking better every time under Tim Sherwood. BTW, release the 3rd jersey to other sites, it's beautiful...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-01 19:40:57	I think the Leafs' goalie is wearing a winter hat.... WAIT HE IS! #SillyLooking
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-01 19:43:55	Imagine the amount of pucks lost today. No net + snowing. They'll find it when they clean the field for football.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-01 20:15:40	I forgot how strange Cyrus is in Platinum... maybe not strange, just shows up in the most random places spewing random thoughts
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-12-31 20:52:53	I really like the #Droid commercial with Edward Norton. #RandomThought
94620632	ThomCaito	2013-12-31 22:52:53	Just spent the past 30 minutes looking for a Growlithe in #PokemonPlatinum only to find out you have to have the Nat'l Dex. #bummer
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-03 15:18:35	Exciting morning I guess. #Bear started no problem where the #Flagship did. Going up to Durham for a bit to work?
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-04 00:19:57	Last night @tayobanana definitely made shot drinking into an algebra equation. If you have two liquors, you need to do both to keep em equal
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-04 00:31:19	Every so often the dog will grab a piece of kibble, sprint down the hall to @bcaito14 's room and eat it there. She is a weird one.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-04 01:06:15	@bcaito14 uh random much?
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-05 10:19:57	Get out of my dream. K thanks..
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-07 19:50:36	If you think you're cold, just remember I get to spend 40 minutes in a car with no heat to and from work. #firstworldproblems
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-08 01:28:36	My new goal when I go on vacations is to go see a local pro/semipro soccer team play. Why? Because I want to see the quality of play
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-10 03:50:20	@bcaito14 remember #RedSox tix are tiered now, Sox/Yanks game might be more expensive
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-10 03:53:54	@bcaito14 try a mariners or twins game...maybe a bad NL team
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-10 03:55:52	Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit looks really good
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-10 03:56:49	@bcaito14 I don't have my computer handy
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-09 18:56:26	Call me a bad New Englander, but I want the #Patriots to lose so they can finish the same place in the playoffs the #Revs did.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-09 18:58:04	That way I have a point why Kraft should spend more money on his "other" team...or be a good owner and go to AND wear appropriate attire #P2
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-10 05:59:43	@tayobanana next screenshot coming up!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-10 06:01:57	@tayobanana and this one! http://t.co/x9FyBbau3K
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-10 06:05:06	@tayobanana just kinda? There is no kinda, just awesome!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-10 06:08:12	@tayobanana oh definitely. 3 modes of communicating at once? That's gotta count for something!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-10 06:10:46	@tayobanana which is pretty awesome!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-09 22:13:51	Compliments on the beard are still happening. Wünderbar!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-10 03:31:37	@TotalMLS @thegoalkeeper oh god no. Anyone but FOX...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-10 05:51:41	This definitely happened. @tayobanana http://t.co/BGVqXtitQ9
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-10 03:37:01	Just read a comment about how some bars didn't have #NBCSN... they must not be near a decent #NHL team... I liked #NBC's coverage of @MLS
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-10 03:38:10	But that doesn't matter because its all money money money... and FOX is just outbidding everyone...even on a WC that is changing seasons
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-12 05:06:46	On your left is rolling fog. On your right is probably where the Zombies are lying in wait. #ShitSeanSays
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-12 05:06:47	Maybe the fog is a neurotoxin from another planet? #ShitSeanSays

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-11 01:48:30	@amberglassman I don't even have an instagram...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-13 19:58:10	I'm becoming a busy person. Not sure if I like it yet but I can get used to it.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-14 20:23:40	All of this wheeling and dealing in #MLS, reminds me of how I manage my clubs during transfer clubs in #FIFA14
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-18 04:23:41	Just found the source of the mysterious tapping noise in my room... it was a metal-ish thing above my closet. It is no longer in that locale
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-18 04:25:41	USL PRO announces plan to stream all 2014 games free on YouTube #MLS http://t.co/JqQtHSMPsR
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-19 13:34:20	Woke up early to get some work for #TheKing done...why not put the #SWAvTOT game on. #BPLonNBC
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-19 15:00:24	Well this belongs to #Tottenham. Especially after Adebayor's latest goal
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-15 19:16:48	Mon-Fri 11-7. Not bad. Allows for a social life. Oh and no heat in Bear again. Wonderful...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-16 19:05:07	Yeah... I really don't want to program the register again. Or figure out how this dinosaur fax machine works. But hey, I get paid to do it
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-20 02:14:55	Oh I cannot say in words how much I love the #Seahawks jersey. I think I want one.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-20 02:43:08	I'm trying to find a long sleeve #Revs primary kit... I think this is the sign that they're getting a new one. #MaybeItllBebetter #OrWorse
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-21 19:14:23	@bcaito14 if people actually used Google plus
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-21 22:14:57	@kato_888 his portable battery pack. And that's interesting
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-21 20:52:28	#TheCrownPrince is giving me something? This is strange. No complaints from me!

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-23 03:59:34	For the record, if I had two equally beautiful girls. One blonde, one brunette, the brunette would win. #JustSoYouKnow
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-24 01:11:39	@bcaito14 yes that too

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-26 20:46:34	Just trying to get my hands on a #Hunter #ManOWar  in #AC4BlackFlag. So naturally I'm just pissing everyone off by running/gunning enemies.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-26 21:04:57	Perusing the Caribbean on #AC4BlackFlag, causing mayhem where ever I go.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-28 22:14:39	Oh this is going to be a boring 4 hours. Slow AND two people working? I'd rather work alone thanks.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-28 03:12:57	91% completion on #ac4blackflag. next big hurdle are the "twins" then all of the uncharted shit. #Determined

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-01-30 19:28:30	I totally called San Antonio's interest in joining @MLS... next, Minnesota + Atlanta. Though I've already read about group interest in both
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-02-01 02:08:36	Catching up on TV shows. #WhiteCollar and now starting #BlackSails on #Starz

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-02-04 22:50:25	What happened to rumors being rumors? Twitter, that's what happened. They turn rumors into pseudo fact.

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-02-21 01:03:47	I'm curious, if #ChivasUSA is returning the loaned players back to #Chivas, will the loanees complain about lack of playing time?
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-02-21 01:05:30	Because you know...they want to play and are paid to play. #ChivasUSA
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-02-21 01:08:34	Well maybe its just one guy. And a forward at that, he'll want to play.

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-02-21 17:35:14	wondering if the new primary kit for the #NERevs is the same design as I've seen in the pictures of preseason. Not saying theyre bad..#Part1
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-02-21 17:36:01	but they could do a whole lot better. Like paying someone decent at designing to create a new kit design #part2 #NERevs

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-02-26 03:08:37	So my pro on #fifa14 even reacts the same way to fouls as I do in real life. Kinda creepy...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-02-26 00:58:55	I dont care that hes winning, Im more upset that he doesnt bet more in final jeopardy than he is. If you're going to blow them away, go big.

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-05 01:22:56	@bcaito14 Rowe-your-boat in the new #NERevs kit. Logo is too bulky for my liking. http://t.co/PRvcwJsqFE
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-04 16:30:37	I will completely rely on MLS power rankings the entire season because they do so well at it. #sarcasm
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-05 03:50:21	Probably not a good idea to eat a dinnersized sammich at 11pm. #ohwell
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-05 17:28:17	Just got #WatchESPN on my phone so I can watch the #USMNT take on #UKR. Sounds like a good time.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-05 18:47:49	Gotta find something to do next week. #TheUnexpectedVacation
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-05 03:26:52	Catching up on #TopGear and had to rewind to catch this face. Thanks for the laughs @RichardHammond http://t.co/ujB5caWRvG
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-04 16:31:29	Not like any other power rankings do well either.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-06 03:31:19	#Ressurrection looks like an interesting show...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-05 21:12:46	Last time we'll see Brooks for awhile. Especially after his performance today. I'd say he doesn't make WC roster. #USMNT
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-05 21:57:39	Klinsmann snickered when he mentioned the back 2 never played together. Well duh. Watching the last goal was an obvious sign of it.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-09 14:10:02	That GE commercial is cool yet weird. Trains that are friends with trees? Person responsible for that must've been on something
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-08 15:20:43	Cant help to compare Diablo's invasion of the High Heavens in @Diablo to the Overmind's invasion of Auir in @Starcraft...just about the same
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-08 19:17:31	Spurs lost it real fast. 2-0 is an honorable defeat, 4-0 is not.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-08 19:40:06	#VitaminStringQuartet while I wait for #Sounders game! Can't wait to hear and can't wait for July when I'm going to see them at the clink!

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-08 21:00:37	Note to followers: my tweets will mostly be soccer-related until baseball season, then it will be soccer &gt; baseball &gt; everything else
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-08 21:38:15	Dempsey lurking on the sidelines! #SoundersFC
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-08 21:42:25	so two people should've had second yellows. one for each team...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-08 22:16:29	GOOOOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!! @SoundersFC
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-09 22:46:48	EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!! #LEGOMovie #GreatTime
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-09 01:25:13	Yay for spending money. Officially part of a #SounderFC supporter group, got new music, and trying to pay off a new loan quicker. #Splurge

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-09 02:03:00	When I heard about replacement refs for @MLS I was thinking itd be like the @NFL games. Looking at the list, some are pretty experienced
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-09 02:04:03	#NERevs sucking more air as they let in another goal. 3-0 for #Dynamo

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-10 04:31:28	Patience. Patience with people with busier lives than me. It is a test for me to overcome.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-13 00:20:25	Too bad I can't watch #SKCvCAZ. Sounds like a great matchup! #Shame
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-13 00:26:51	From the twitter feed, I see SKC grabbed a goal!

GO #SKC!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-13 00:34:37	#BreakingBenjamin in orchestra form? Just perfect for calming down. #VitaminStringQuartet
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-11 00:10:13	She's whistling. Its almost as if she wants me to reach uncomfortably just to poke her/pet her. Silly pup, I'm a lazy hooman.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-11 00:11:05	Soccer needs to happen more than once a week. Oh wait, it will! With the help of FOX (unfortunately) I will get to watch more!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-14 21:11:23	I'm on an adventure! With @bcaito14 #ToTheMountains!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-15 01:55:08	Skiing was awesome! Maybe I'll go again before the season's over. #NightSkiingPlease
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-13 23:05:45	I am a #timebender, why is today taking forever to pass by! I must get to the weekend to watch soccer! Meaning Saturday and Sunday...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-13 23:25:20	And I thought the #USMNT were the only ones not to have a designated stadium. The #Azzurri don't have one either. Time to search for others
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-13 23:38:29	Spain, Netherlands, Germany, Brazil, and Australia are the big ones that don't play in official "home" stadiums
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-15 20:37:43	Switching between #SEAvTOR and local broadcast of PHIvNE. Not expecting from second game.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-15 22:14:27	@NBCSports your info gram on goals in SEAvTOR: you used the timbers logo instead of the #SoundersFC logo. Tsk tsk
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-15 22:04:06	Best string of play all day. SEAvTOR 1-2
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-15 12:35:46	Starting #PaulOfDune. Super excited about more back story of the heros transformation to tyrant. While listening/watching soccer. #Wunderbar

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-15 12:59:41	Man down doesn't phase #ManCity. Beautiful goal #HULvMC
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-15 15:18:01	Look at all the shirt pulling and bitching! Its ridiculous! #SUNvCP
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-15 17:32:34	What did Gramme tap Arlo and wanted motioned that he wanted to talk? These two are something else.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-19 02:07:57	Surprise! Part of another wedding party. I didnt want to assume but #TheCrownPrince included me and the other bros. Sweet deal. Tuxs are fun

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-23 18:57:07	Time to watch some #Fleming. Haven't watched in awhile, too busy unfortunately. #AtLeastBusyMinded
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-23 19:08:28	Pretty sure the brunette in #Fleming was Irene Adler in #Sherlock.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-23 19:08:43	Just checked, it is.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-25 01:55:49	@kato_888 @bcaito14 I already knew this, bought the #SEAvTOT tickets today
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-26 21:44:22	Jozy needs to score a goal sometime soon...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-26 21:56:58	I love when customers come in and say "who's playing" when I'm watching soccer on my phone. Am I surprised? Definitely.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-26 15:14:46	Have to risk getting a ticket because people don't know how to park in my work's parking lot. Welcome to Durham NH. #annoyed

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-30 03:13:17	#NERevs technically still haven't scored. Meaning nobody on the #NERevs have a goal tally yet.

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-03-30 04:29:14	#NERevs got their goal finally. Maybe one of the teams im rooting for tonight will win #SJvNE

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-04-03 04:08:08	Excellent first half from the #USMNT. Downside was some questionable defensive play. Germany and Portugal are going to punish for mistakes

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-03 12:31:18	That was a bad wall on so many levels... #WHUvTOT
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-03 12:32:11	Not goal of the week quality IMO... It was bad defending, where it should be the shooter showing quality. #WHUvTOT
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-03 12:42:33	I'm still facepalming at the Tottenham "wall." So bad. The ball if it's hit near you you're supposed to block it... You're the wall...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-03 13:27:17	@kato_888 well the vendor ran out.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-04 00:15:08	Funny how the two teams in #MLS I support are ahead of their respective conferences. Coolio #NERevs #SoundersFC
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-03 12:53:56	Well... Looks like I will have to go buy my #3DS. And here I thought #Amazon would've spared me the pains of dealing with the local dummies
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-03 13:11:50	But I just want my 3DS. And I don't really trust Gamestops refurbished stuff. Last resort I guess.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-03 13:27:02	@kato_888 ran out of stock... and I placed my order 3 days ago. Great timing.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-08 04:07:36	Well done by #SoundersFC! Looking forward to #NEvSEA this weekend at Gillette!

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-23 03:52:07	I can now endlessly twirl my home screen like #TheCrownPrince. Bahahaha
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-22 19:34:41	Not working gives me all this free time. 2 exhausting runs this week. My knees will hate me tomorrow #Yippee
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-24 18:39:24	@kato_888 Yeah lasted for 30 mins bc it still sucked at staying on. I have the software for netgear and the router is OLD.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-24 18:40:00	@kato_888 and we had a PW on it but it crashed so often they took it off
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-24 18:58:52	And here goes the crybaby...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-24 19:24:30	Capitalize on mistakes, cover up your own. That's how you win.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-24 20:21:10	Bale still isn't worth the money. Too much pressure.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-24 20:30:27	Woah. Go Atletico. Hold them off a little longer. Deny them their glory, claim it for yourself
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-24 20:44:40	And extra time starts #UCL
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-24 20:58:54	Dive anyone?
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-24 21:08:12	That ball just cruised on. The ball out rolled the player
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-24 21:19:44	Never make that face again. Please.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-24 01:12:10	Sick of people potentially stealing our WiFi. If we crash the internet, I want to know its us, not the neighbors.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 01:04:28	#USMNT backline looks the way I would have it. Midfield works for the most part. And of course those two up front. Looks promising
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 01:06:39	@NHProblems Seabrook's Unofficial Motto: "Have you taken your Iodine tablets today?"
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 01:08:23	Andddd that's one for #NYRB. Nice goal.  #SKCvNY
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 01:36:20	Bahahaha they're saying football club on national tv #SKCvNY #SayingItRIGHT! #RealFootball
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 02:03:52	Time to get #WheresWondo trending. How bout it @bcaito14 #USMNT #USAvAZE
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 02:13:15	Azerbaijan: "The country better known for sponsoring Atletico Madrid's shirts." #InstantClassicQuote #USAvAZE
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-26 01:11:12	Best weekend I've had in awhile! #estatic
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 02:18:49	Bradley he probably can't understand youd #USAvAZE
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 02:20:22	#Wondo takes a nice foul! #USMNT #USAvAZE
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 02:21:10	Sooo many -ov's. Oh wait, former Soviet republic. Never mind....
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 02:25:00	@bcaito14 he's so upset he's eating cereal #USMNT
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 02:26:32	And that's 2. 3rd times the charm? One more #Wondo
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 02:28:27	Lots of chances early. Here's another corner! #USMNT
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 02:30:48	Uh... Backwards is bad
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 02:31:48	And another corner for #USMNT
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 02:32:41	Funny how they're doing the same thing I've been doing in #FIFA14 for corners
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 02:39:50	Not deliberate but was redirected.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 02:49:16	Altidore looks a little flat
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 03:17:18	No PK. WHAT?! How about a goal here Mr. Davis #USMNT... oh bummer
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 03:43:52	Mix for the gooooaaaaaallllllll! #USMNT #USAvAZE
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 03:49:46	Johansson for a goal! 2-0 #USMNT #USAvAZE
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 04:03:51	Get with it @SportsCenter. Remember there are more sports than the playoff games. Might want to get familiar with the next big sport.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 04:04:53	Mix, so humble. In the end 10 is just a number #USMNT
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 04:07:31	Nice save on that one @SportsCenter. He's just down the hall #FACEPALM its okay, you can do that on the air.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 04:10:06	Summary: #USMNT wins. Thanks for the birthday present #HappyFace
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-26 17:27:15	#ThankYou to all those have served and those still serving in the armed forces. #MemorialDay
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-27 17:20:30	trying to keep my mind busy today. Luckily soccer is on tonight. #Yippee
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 00:00:48	This is a sad story, always enjoyed young teams playing giants http://t.co/fjHUZQAFcK via @ProSoccerTalk
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 00:02:01	Hoping those Rhinos can get a win. Watching from the distance but as a #NERevs affiliate, you've got my support. #USOC2014
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 00:02:54	And dang that was a close one #SKC. Get those finishes to help out the defense a little #SKCvNY
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 00:03:57	And @KaseyKeller18 your glasses were kind of crooked, just lettin' you know
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 00:05:18	Not really sure if that... was a hand ball but okay. #SKCvNY
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 00:06:07	So far its been all #SKC
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 00:10:05	There you go #SKC, there you go.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 00:25:47	That's all chest...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 00:25:56	maybe a shoulder...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 00:33:57	#NYRB's gk position is like SS for the #RedSox. Yep, I compared them.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 00:35:54	Nice to see Collin back for #SKC
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 00:38:48	No worries Dwyer, you'll have more chances. Especially how #NYRB are playing. #SKCvNY
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-05-28 00:57:26	yeah... as much as I like the help.. $8.50/hr @ 40 hours won't pay the bills. Especially if its in Concord. Still gotta get there somehow...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-01 18:01:33	Formalities then #USMNT game. #USAvTUR
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-01 18:33:05	And that's how goals should be scored. One for Fabian Johnson. 1-0 #USMNT USAvTUR
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-01 19:20:17	GOOOOOAAAAALLLLL DEMPSEY! Yes! 2-0 #USMNT #USAvTUR
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-01 19:22:53	There aren't enough accents and umlauts in the Turkish names
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-01 19:23:34	And it was more the referee's as a collective to miss that handball from Brad Davis
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-02 23:05:46	@kato_888 yup I know
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-02 02:45:17	Just watching some #TreehouseMasters gogo #DVR. I'm learning the ways
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-06 15:30:37	Another reason I don't like NBA, the players are big babies. Go play outside for 90+ minutes against the best in the world. Cramps got you?
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-07 18:45:51	On an adventure with @bcaito14. Well he's getting comfortable with a manual and I'm here riding along #ComedicRelief?
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-07 18:47:31	Or #MoralSupport. Happy @bcaito14?
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-07 22:11:50	@kato_888 yeah
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-08 04:21:01	Seattle has the depth, the world cup isn't a distraction. @SoundersFC
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-10 00:30:10	"Time for #Boston fans to take notice of #Revolution http://t.co/c7JZ1BOAQH via @BostonGlobe" Thank you very much for the article @cgasper
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-10 00:32:26	Nice to hear the younger Kraft at a #NERevs game
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-10 06:14:44	Well, looks like all the cool games are coming out for Xbox One now. Next investment will be it. Oh goody. #GamerProblems
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-10 06:25:21	Hurry up Kings and win the Stanley Cup, The World Cup is coming...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-12 00:24:44	And here's my #StanleyCup tweet. Go #Kings. I remember a couple of these guys from the #ManchesterMonarchs
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-12 00:35:46	Watching #MTLvDC and someone got a hatrick. So off comes the hat. It hit the fan then went across the room. The dog looked confused
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-12 02:02:42	Apparently each player on the Brazilian Nat'l team has their own Gatorade made specifically to their needs. #Wow
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-12 20:02:04	And here....we....go.... #WorldCup #BRAvsCRO
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-12 21:32:19	And the goalkeeper almost saved that. Woops #BRAvsCRO #WorldCup2014
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-13 16:29:16	What a mistake! That should've been a goal. 27th minute. #MEXvCMR
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-12 23:46:06	Love watching former foreign players (now analysts) bicker at each other. This is great
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-11 03:12:05	At this point in time, sucks to be Beckham. I've been skeptical since the beginning. Miami's gov't won't even let him build a stadium #lol
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-13 19:46:11	What a PERFECT goal. Well done #RvP #ESPvsNED #WC2014
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-13 20:23:09	So much for Spanish dominance. They're getting out played by the Dutch. #WorldCup2014 #ESPvNED
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-13 20:32:20	Wow. #RvP is on fire! #ESPvNED #WorldCup2014
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-13 20:34:06	After the #UCLFinal performance by Casillas and now this, he doesn't look world class.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-16 05:15:59	Not sure if I'm more annoyed that I'm back tracking or I have no idea who I'm working with tomorrow... Or the whole week. Oh goody.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-16 19:03:47	@amberglassman nope, an old one. Like Pauly's...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-22 23:23:40	Joooooooones! #USMNT
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-22 23:41:20	Dempsssssssssssey! #USMNT
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-22 23:45:28	Someone give Jurgen a hug. #USMNT
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-22 23:54:30	That's pretty depressing
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-24 02:24:53	After watching #EveryStreetUnited, my urge to play soccer is even greater. Though Id probably break an ankle trying to replicate their moves
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-25 23:01:26	I know its the "New England" Revolution, but if you want to eventually play inner city, play in Boston.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-25 23:01:56	**Meaning for US Open Cup games in last tweet
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-26 14:01:59	Well, Suarez got his ban. 4 months plus a fine? I'm satisfied. #SeeYa
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-26 16:01:08	Loving the #USA chants in Recife. #USAvsGermany #IBelieveThatWeWillWin #USMNT
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-24 17:51:17	Luis Suarez should start a Biters Anonymous group. "Hi, I'm Luis and I can't stop biting other players." #facepalm
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-27 16:42:04	If you don't like the sport and most of all don't want to/don't care to understand how it works, DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-29 01:15:56	Lols. Revs are losing it. No excuse for sloppy play.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-29 01:17:27	And #Sounders came out of the break still winning. Even without Dempsey, Yedlin, or Martins. #ShowingDepth
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-27 16:11:50	Almost got hit twice today in Hampton. Can't blame out of staters on this one... ugh summer traffic.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-01 03:29:04	Look mah! No burns! Just some super awesome Italian skin...and maybe some Mohawk in there
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-06-29 12:27:44	Predictions:  Netherlands wins against Mexico. Costa Rica wins against Greece. #WorldCup2014 #RoundOf16
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-01 15:12:07	Sorry but saying "Because we have Messi" is not a legitimate argument. #ItTakes11 #WorldCup2014

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-08 23:01:24	Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha Brazil lost. I'm still wondering how Germany scores 1 against USA but 7 against Brazil. Ranking still means zilch
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-11 16:36:31	@kato_888 Nope. Haven't played since May I think
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-11 16:39:53	@kato_888 Yeah. After TT and going solo for a bit I went. Some of the same people I raided with are there
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-11 16:42:46	@kato_888 Lol I've been in that group for a few months at least. I got an auto invite after leaving TT

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-12 03:51:36	Busch of the #Quakes has the BEST eye rolls of @MLS. @oba_martins goal and now Rolfe's goal. Go check the replays if you don't believe me.

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-10 18:32:48	I think Bruce Arena already reincarnated into Caleb Porter. Just the way they both go about complaining about calls/games.

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-14 03:33:28	First home #SoundersFC game. Wishing for a goal or 3. #SEAvPOR
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-14 00:19:20	Rave Green everywhere! Finally made it out to a march to the match! #SoundersFC
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-14 08:28:01	So @REM4292 compared d my phones battery life to the oil of a Hanukkah story tonight. Too bad the battery didn't last. #JustWait #TheresMore
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-14 08:31:20	She also mentioned that she almost wrote feral position instead of fetal when she was laughing so much. Wait what? @REM4292 #Perfect

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-22 00:19:29	How have I not known about #RayDonovan until today?! Great show!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-22 01:40:04	So called it. The 7 in the Squamish language is a stop. A glottal stop to be precise. Yep, I'm a nerd.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-22 01:42:47	@amberglassman that's always a good idea!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-22 01:53:53	@amberglassman okay, a little more reasonable haha

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-25 00:10:26	Wow, Rev's prez actually conversing with twitter accounts on if there are any transfer talks. No specifics but there are a few #amazed
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-27 04:31:51	Okay, STH's should be asking FO of the @NERevolution if they should get a refund. Gameplay is just BAD. Time for some change. #NERevs
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-27 04:33:52	There's a reason nobody can back this team, they do things like 8 losses in a row. You could put money on them losing. Next? #Rapids

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-29 02:16:50	And its back!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-29 02:28:57	What the hell was Yedlin doing? Can't be ball watching near LD #SEAvLA
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-29 02:33:50	Come on Yedlin, GET ON LD. He will and is sneaking past you. #SEAvLA
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-29 02:37:31	Well deserved yellow. That is a heel, not a ball. #SEAvLA
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-29 02:38:16	And Zardes is getting railroaded left and right. There's going to be a card for that soon.... #SEAvLA
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-29 02:53:21	How do you kick the ball on a REBOUND back at the keeper ON THE GROUND?! #SEAvLA
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-29 03:48:12	What a dive by Robbie Rogers... #SEAvLA
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-07-29 04:07:16	Hey #SoundersFC! Shake it off and go win against the #Quakes. You did the same when the #NERevs beat you 5-0. #YouGotThis
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-02 23:14:15	Still think #NYRB should change their name to New Jersey Red Bulls. They don't play in NY. And another team will be...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-04 23:29:49	I'll keep saying this until the #NERevs get a new 'keeper. Shuttleworth does not have the quality of a starting GK. #Hint: GET A NEW GK.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-04 23:36:34	Rumblings of #MLS switching to FIFA calendar. Tell me, how does grass grow in Toronto mid-February? Or Montreal for that matter...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-06 00:34:35	Watching Bridget eat ice cream is probably one of THE funniest things to witness. She just about threw it across the room
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-06 00:56:05	No soccer on tonight. No work tomorrow. What should I do? Hmmm.... #bored
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-06 22:35:35	Finally got #NHT in #FIFA14 up to the #BPL. Oh yeah, its year 2023. And I accepted the job of the US head coach. Yippee
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-07 02:13:32	@GrantWahl That's the Collin way!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-07 02:35:24	OH MY GOD RIMANDO. You are ridiculous. #MLSAllStar
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-07 02:37:16	Lol Yedlin just ran over someone
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-07 03:06:06	WHAT. A. GOAL! Bradley Wright-Phillips! Das ist wunderbar! #SeeWhatIDidThere #MLSAllStar
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-07 03:24:12	And LD does it. He beat Neuer. Very nice! #MLSAllStar
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-07 03:25:46	And now the guy I want to see score a goal, Dom Dwyer. Yippee! #MLSAllStar
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-07 03:35:21	I'm going to call them the "Poachers"
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-07 03:41:34	Almost Dwyer, almost. #MLSAllStar
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-07 03:45:00	#SanJose think they have the bash brothers? Stick W. Johnson and Alonso on the same team. Hell if there was room Beckerman could join
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-07 03:53:49	Hey, people say @MLS is a physical league. Preseason or not, just showing how we play. Remember, you agreed to play against us. #MLSAllStar
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-05 12:19:34	Lol just saw #ChivasUSA 's attendance. Less than the #NERevs. Still think LA deserves 2 teams? Naw. @MLS
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-10 18:01:11	Still sore from playing soccer on Friday. #Yikes
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-10 18:16:05	Why should work be any different from school. Apparently pens are so expensive people can't get their own.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-10 23:01:55	Found it, kinda. #GTAV #NorthYankton @bcaito14 @PaulCaito http://t.co/Qyzlgoe4In
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-11 02:37:40	God, we have to wait for Arena Football to finish? They should be moved for the #SEAvHOU game. #MoreFans #AndTheySingToo
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-11 03:07:53	If they were consistent with calling GKs being off their line, then yes it should've been retaken. But since its not, get over it.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-11 04:15:57	All of a sudden @SoundersFC are leading 2-0. #SEAvHOU @bcaito14
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-09 22:49:17	"Waiting around for someone to want to play in a football stadium, on turf in a home not bearing the clubs name" is too long... gotta chase.

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-13 16:20:33	A donation is a donation. A person shouldn't be forced to do something they don't want to or donate a certain amount. That defeats the (p1)
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-13 16:22:28	Purpose of goodwill. A donation should reflect what the person who is donating feels is an appropriate amount given current financial status
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-13 16:22:51	and the last tweet was p2 by the way...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-13 16:36:17	@PaulCaito oh definitely
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-13 16:49:24	@PaulCaito And his response?
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-13 17:04:16	@PaulCaito Say no to peer pressure
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-16 00:06:51	You could definitely play Marco Polo in Home Depot at 8pm on a Friday lol. Or a nerf gun battle.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-16 01:35:01	@bcaito14 search and destroy or capture the flag?
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-16 02:01:03	We are now closed..... So get out!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-19 02:04:48	Stop getting forwards. Need a true starting GK and shore up the defense. The US is known for producing good GKs, time to exploit it #NERevs
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-16 14:48:48	Oh just watching some games this morning http://t.co/DMOICdBCeM
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-20 00:11:45	Got my @Diablo #ReaperOfSouls. Ready to romp around as a #Crusader! And the return of another of my Paladin names from @Warcraft
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-21 12:30:18	From what I've been reading... Balotelli to LFC, Di Maria wants out, and J. Jones signed with MLS. #MovingDay
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-21 16:46:36	My goodness this is a mess (#JonesSaga). If he wanted to go to Fire should've just ended it right there
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-22 15:37:50	"You can teach people the rules. You can't teach them to love the game." David Markley in an article about soccer in Austin
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-22 18:36:54	In wise words of Donna-tella Moss: "Exercise cautious optimism." Exactly what I have to do today.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-21 02:13:49	TV + HDMI cable + laptop + internet + @MLS Live subscription = @SoundersFC game on east coast :D #SEAvSJ
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-21 02:15:31	Wow fancy tricks
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-22 20:59:31	Running a 3-4-3 in top flight soccer is audacious and requires confidence in your backline and defensive midfielder(s)/wingers
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-24 22:12:16	Jermaine Jones to #NERevs. FINALLY a move I wanted them to do. Question now is when will he be able to play?
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-24 22:23:36	Timbers are picking tackles and losing the call. And they're also falling quite easily. Good luck winning a game that way. #PORvSEA
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-24 22:25:31	#SorryNotSorry no calls are going your way Urruti. #PORvSEA
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-24 22:27:29	Okay you got a call, now shut it. #PORvSEA
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-24 22:30:46	That's what happens when you mouth off too much, you get a yellow card. #WelcomeToTheClub Urruti. #PORvSEA

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-08-28 21:18:48	@PaulCaito Sean and I have these conversations all the time lol
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-01 04:25:27	My mind is a sponge, just give me something to absorb.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-01 05:31:11	Apparently me being at my friend's enough warranted the idea of having a guest room. Well, more like a place to sleep instead of the couch
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-02 19:25:56	Yeah that looks promising #tstorm http://t.co/23SZgdgtwn

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-02 20:32:36	And its gone #tstorm http://t.co/rt3KXsUuSN
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-04 00:23:44	DEFLECTED! 1-1 #NEvSKC
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-04 00:26:05	Doesn't look like Sinovic can touch a #NERevs player without getting a foul. #NEvSKC
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-04 00:44:43	NGUYEN!!!!! Nice play to get the goal! 2-1 #NEvSKC
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-04 03:01:25	Kasey Keller said it himself: "suicidal defending" while talking about #ChivasUSA lol #CHVvSEA
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-04 03:23:57	Just because one team is beating another thoroughly, does not mean you can't give fouls. I want consistency. #CHVvSEA
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-03 23:14:48	Well its almost time. Time for the #NERevs to show this Jones guy to #SKC. I was hoping to see Jones and Collin be physical on the field...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-06 01:17:13	So Joe's #XboxOne signed me on when I sat down. Creep.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-10 19:08:58	I love how I can use my phone as a remote for YouTube on my #Xbox360. This makes everything easier

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-13 05:14:20	#SoundersFC won with a late thriller over #RSL. Oh and #Destiny is AMAZING! #INeedAXboxOne
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-14 00:46:31	I'm exhausted. Hopefully the last moving I need to help with for awhile
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-16 02:36:10	Wait... reports of Matt Damon coming back to play as Jason Bourne and Paul Greengrass directing? I just hope they're true. #JasonBourne
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-16 23:43:59	What's GolTV? Does anyone actually have that channel? I'll take @RossFletcher1 on the audio any day though #PHIvSEA #USOC2014
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-17 00:41:38	GOOOOOAAAAAAL SEATTLE! #ComebackPros
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-17 00:43:35	#USOC2014 should get a new channel provider for next season's campaign. Especially the final because trophies are well... trophies!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-17 00:44:10	Preferably one that is widely available to everyone. *cough* NBC
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-17 00:44:53	Or leave it to the team to stream it online.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-17 00:50:59	Hahaha @RossFletcher1 describing Conor Casey with the best adjectives possible.

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-18 17:30:27	The new MLS (highly adaptable) crest is really cool! At first I was skeptical about a new logo but now each team has their own! #MLSNEXT
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-21 16:18:38	They call me the gazelle now. Just because I run fast and can run faster when needed. #SoccerPlayerPlayingFootball
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-22 03:48:59	Finally got myself a knee brace. You know its time when you walk away from playing sports limping every time. #EmbraceTheBrace

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-29 02:20:37	Basic synopsis for the #LAvNY game: Keane, Donovan, Zardes and #NYRB barely able to find the other half of the pitch.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-09-30 18:52:17	See ya Chivas USA. No more whipping boy of the west.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-04 21:49:08	This time next week I will be starting my adjustment to my temporary schedule. Yippee...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-04 22:15:58	Any professional team that shares a stadium with another should not have to see their lines/markers on the field when they are playing.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-04 22:20:52	Next weekend is going to be hectic.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-06 00:59:17	HAHA! I CAN STILL SEE WHERE THE LINES WERE!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-08 16:04:51	As LD's farewell to #USMNT, I would want to see him play the 90 minutes. That way at the end it'd be more of a moment than if he got subbed
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-09 02:40:29	Looks like a German club, but hey gotta give credit to a club looking to renew their look. Also like the whole SC thing #NewCrew
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-09 02:42:55	Mmmmm, I know its only the middle of the week but I was looking forward to having plans this weekend other than flipping sleep schedules...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-12 10:25:40	And time to sleep. 1.5 achievements closer to Loremaster. Time to see if these blackout curtains will work. #SleepyTime
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-13 04:43:06	Just reading up on some #WoW changes. Lvl 100 DK's will be a hunch of mini-Lich Kings now. Necrotic Plague/Defile anyone? #Warcraft
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-13 23:58:47	Overnights are going to be an interesting experience. #PlayBeforeWork #AllDayLong
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-14 23:17:29	@Warcraft why can't I fly on my newly boosted to 90 character. I was flying in Northrend before I boosted it. Any help would be appreciated
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-19 01:29:23	@bcaito14 I'm not surprised...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-20 00:45:48	So um... Apparently the #LAGalaxy fans don't know that the 10th minute is during the 9:00 mark and not during the 10:00 mark... #LAvSEA
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-22 19:31:09	Its funny when the ball is being passed like right next to #cr7 he just looks at it. Shame. 100% all the time, not just offense.

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-25 14:19:42	Didn't know #TheKing was in the kitchen. So when his phone was ringing I thought he was calling my phone. #SimilarRingtones
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-10-29 16:34:27	Trying out #TribalWars2. So far so good. Just gotta remember to check in occasionally haha #Distractions
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-02 04:25:48	Watched two very different games tonight. A clash of semi-porous defenses (#NEvCLB) and a goalkeeper showdown (#RSLvLA)
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-01 05:14:22	Fire after some downtown escapades. Good way to end a night. #NERevs game tomorrow!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-04 03:05:22	Though I'm not a huge fan of yellow, those BVB jerseys... nice yet bright. The away is a nice black.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-05 21:24:46	It's one of those days where I'm already in my pajamas. #LazyAfternoon

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-06 23:36:15	Got an alumni call... was this about me or you? #YouTalkTooMuch
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-09 22:15:45	Okay #NERevs, go out and win this one. Cleanest sheet as possible. #NEvCLB... oh and NO gridiron lines! #Progress
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-09 22:17:11	Well...some lines. Faded is better than seemingly fresh painted ones...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-09 22:53:13	GOOOOOOOAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!!! #MVLee #NEvCLB
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-09 23:23:22	And thats TWO! #NERevs #NEvCLB

94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-10 01:54:26	Well, #LAvRSL series is done. Time to watch the season premiere of #Newsroom
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-10 04:24:58	Really helps detail what someone should do to make an effective fantasy world "7 Deadly Sins of Worldbuilding http://t.co/XBgZRnbwPb"
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-10 04:30:57	Issue with having a massive world already created and then making a backstory, how much do you reveal to the supposed reader at a time?
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-10 04:31:41	Just follow one "hero" at a time per chapter? "Hero" in this case being a main character.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-10 04:32:24	So in theory its filling in the gaps. And not release the whole world map until the entire story is finished?
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-10 04:33:01	And your 5 readers are like "That's definitely how I envisioned the world" #HahaJK #NotAtAll
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-10 04:33:38	And the nerd rant has concluded for now, but the mind continues to race.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-10 04:39:45	Oh and #FightForTheAlliance
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-11 15:33:13	Thank you to all those who have served our country, happy Veteran's Day!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-11 15:58:53	Not impressed with Gamestop. If you are releasing a game, you should probably have it on its release day.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-11 03:50:50	Delay of kickoff time? Still won't stop me from watching the #SEAvDAL game. #SoundersFC
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-11 03:57:35	Still like the traditional singing of the national anthem and having the crowd join in on the singing is better. @SoundersFC #SEAvDAL
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-11 04:56:50	That woman just put a pizza in a bag in a bag. #Bagception #PizzaForLater
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-11 05:08:38	SEEEAAAATTLLLEEEE!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-11 05:08:54	SOOOOOUUUNNNNDDDDEEERRRRSSSS!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-12 03:41:02	Sorry #ACRogue, science has you beat on the whole earthquake in Lisbon thing. #PlateTectonics #Science
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-12 03:42:25	But a game is a game. Anyway, coming back to New York is cool. Can't ignore a big city like this.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-13 02:59:47	I was wondering when he was going to appear. Hey there Nathan Haytham #ACRogue
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-14 19:46:20	Don't mind my optimism #USAvCOL #USMNT
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-14 19:47:32	And the @Warcraft servers coming back up. And I have to be at work in less than an hour. Soccer &gt; WoW. #SorryNotSorry #USMNT #USAvCOL
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-14 19:48:25	Finally Altidore isn't up there by himself. He's got a buddy, Rubio Rubin. #USMNT #USAvCOL
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-14 19:51:03	Btw, this stadium is perfect size for #NERevs. Fans right on top of the players, and very tight atmosphere
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-14 19:53:06	PENALTY! FOR THE #USMNT! WOOOHOOOOO!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-14 20:17:52	Gotta take advantage of those set pieces! #USMNT #USAvCOL
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-15 01:56:59	People need to log out of Medivh and let me play. This is obnoxious. #AngryAngryAngry
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-18 19:34:04	After his #WC2014 miss, I don't want to see #Wondo called up to the #usmnt
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-16 04:26:16	FIFA on one room, poker in the other. I'm bored. #What?
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-16 17:09:27	This whole table is a mousepad. It works soooooo well #Yippee
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-22 03:04:28	Oh my goodness! Sneaking in #AlphaSapphire and #OmegaRuby !! Geeking out just a bit here #Yippee
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-23 17:35:53	When in doubt, Dragon Rage it out. #ShitSeanSays
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-24 22:49:41	Why do you do all of these silly little vacations to "relax?" Listening to the planning of it, sounds more of a hassle than relaxation #rant
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-24 23:00:32	Downtown soccer is the future http://t.co/ShQhhBZhep
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-23 16:52:34	We gave that pitch a gable. Pitches love gables. #ShitSeanSays
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-23 00:28:58	"You get Phteel Wing from Phteven!" #ShitSeanSays
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-23 02:07:28	"That's not salmon, that's sick pink." - #ShitSeanSays
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-11-30 03:45:25	Really hoping FOX can turn around their soccer broadcasting, or the coming years of MLS coverage will be "I really hope ESPN has this game"
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-01 02:57:35	GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL BRAD EVANS! #SEAvLA #ebfg
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-01 02:59:16	That mustache though... #SEAvLA @brad_evans3
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-01 03:03:02	GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL DEMPSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY! #SEAvLA #ebfg
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-01 04:34:07	As much as I hate seeing a winning team lose due to away goals, away goals is a good idea. It promotes more scoring. #MoarGoals
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-01 04:36:04	Though now I don't need to pick between the #Sounders going for 3 trophies and the #NERevs going for their elusive #MLSCup
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-01 04:38:10	I remember watching the #NERevs losing to the #Dynamo twice. Gah. Time to grab the #MLSCup!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-03 00:30:18	Time to catch all the pokemons! #AlphaSapphire
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-02 20:19:14	You know you're position is strange when most of your coworkers ask what your actual position/department is. #KeepOnGuessing
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-04 05:37:22	I'm disappointed by the voters in @MLS All-Star voting. I think #NERevs Nyugen (a MID) with his goals and creativity should've won it.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-04 21:35:09	Kraft going to the #MLSCupFinal and might be late to his darling #Patriots? I'll believe it when I see it. http://t.co/1FN6BLjFae #NERevs
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-04 21:47:51	@SMErickson7 I knew that article was going push someone in the ownership to do something
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-05 03:26:27	Hmmm. Thinking of brushing up on some map-making techniques and eventually redoing my world. Everyone needs a hobby...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-04 21:43:41	@SMErickson7 Yeah and I'm glad he is. Its a lot to work back from though. Baby steps?
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-04 21:55:11	@SMErickson7 I would take it personally too. And it's good they changed gears so quickly. Once the renderings came out, it had to be legit.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-04 21:56:47	@SMErickson7 Ownership groups don't waste money on renderings and stuff like that
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-07 22:04:16	Woohooo! Tierney for the goal! #NERevs #MLSCup
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-07 22:07:43	Still think Shuttleworth should be replaced as starting GK next year. A lot of these rebounds shouldn't be happening if you caught the ball.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-07 23:10:52	Overall, sloppy game. Passes were everywhere and no where close to where they were supposed to be. Better quality please.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-08 01:59:27	As my dad mentioned to me about the #NERevs not winning: "The #RedSox didn't win from 1918 to 2004." You'll get the #MLSCup in due time
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-08 02:00:40	Not saying it will take that long, this is a promising, young, dynamic team. Next year's agenda (other than playoffs)...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-08 02:01:44	Finding multiple ways to win a game. #NERevs #Part2Tweet
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-07 15:10:48	The day has come. Time to take the cup! #NERevs #MLSCup
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-09 00:09:58	Well theres a good chance Fagundez won't be on #NERevs next year... http://t.co/MxkFjtyewx
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-09 00:14:09	@robbiemcnicks Tweeted from the site and just checked my feed after. Thanks for the correction.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-09 00:21:20	@robbiemcnicks No worries!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-09 03:15:09	Making narwhals extinct on #ACRogue. They'll be rare as unicorns soon enough bahahaha
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-09 05:21:13	I could go to bed. But I have 12 hours until work. I only need 5-6 hours of sleep to function though... #MOARGAMES
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-16 23:53:36	So here I am playing #FIFA14... apparently I'm not good at playing giant teams, but I am very good at playing as small teams... hmm
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-19 01:10:29	Nice to hear that @Xbox is still the @SoundersFC shirt sponsor. Rave green + Xbox = Awesome. Also wouldn't look right with any other logo...
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-19 01:30:33	Playing #FIFA14 again: going away during FA Cup (2nd leg), 5 back sounds like fun. Absorb and counter!
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-19 01:33:07	That's 2 more defenders I usually play with. I'm a 3-5-2 guy
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-20 01:39:38	Sometimes I like to go onto the #MLS site and read the comments to make myself feel better. #FacepalmCentral
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-19 14:27:57	It's an Italy kind of day today http://t.co/UiXXO8yv75
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-19 15:46:39	Playing chauffeur today. And planning routes to various stores are fun. First stop: #Yummies in Kittery, ME
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-23 20:04:57	Sometimes I think my supervisors keep me around for comedic relief/moral support. #StandingAroundAtWork
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-28 14:55:32	Through the city and over the bridge to Grandma's house we go! @PaulCaito @bcaito14 http://t.co/fTyXE1NFIj
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-27 23:30:21	Apparently my Pro on #FIFA15 is a dirty mouth because I'm not saying anything bad... I think the Kinect is mishearing my words.
94620632	ThomCaito	2014-12-29 18:53:09	Finally getting around to watching #GuardiansOfTheGalaxy!! Yay for @redbox!
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-01 14:04:22	2 reasons I'm watching #STKvMU: 1) a new england player is playing; 2) its my favorite sport
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-01 14:07:35	Too bad I can't watch #Breakaway on @NBCSN. Gotta go to work
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-01 02:00:20	Amid all of this Lampard staying, I'm not all that surprised by the decision. I personally want to hear what Kreis' REAL opinion is.
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-01 02:03:54	He's the one that's supposed to assemble the team on the field to get the best results. I would want to have ALL of the DPs that were signed
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-04 04:50:42	Its almost midnight and I'm having SOUP!
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-06 02:45:55	Oh the hipster conversation on #GTAV between Michael and Trever is so awesome. The Proto-hipster.
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-06 03:04:59	When someone says a football game is going to be physical, I can't help but #facepalm. I've been told that's why a lot of people watch it...
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-09 03:23:38	So the #SoundersFC and #NERevs both have "easier" schedules by the amazing maths that #MLS does. I'll wait til the season is actually going
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-16 02:17:20	Got invited to another group of people to play pickup soccer games, only problem... I can't remember where. #facepalm
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-17 01:39:51	Note: the @Xbox voice command does not know Roman numerals. #GrandTheftAutoVEE
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-18 20:12:39	I read a lot of articles and in most cases they get even better. Why? Comments from readers. Some are good, some are bad. And a few laughs.
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-18 05:02:40	Oh just running maths while sipping my whiskey. This venture might just work.
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-20 05:29:32	Cider, websurfing, and #WestWing on @netflix. Good way to end the day.
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-18 23:11:13	Just saw a tweet how the #MLS and #NFL conference finals were in the same stadia, what if the results were the same too? (GB Win, NE Win)
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-18 23:14:25	That's a nice limp
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-22 21:10:08	I'll definitely feel that run later, like in the middle of work. Oh well
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-28 02:01:36	I've been finding boring fun lately. I like to try to drive vehicles up the bike path on Mt Chilead. Next will be an 18-wheeler. #GTAV
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-30 02:09:51	@NEUltras For those in NH: Seacoast United Phantoms - PDL. They play their home games at Portsmouth HS.
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-31 01:29:35	@tayobanana there's a difference between drinking a lot and drinking heavily a lot, trust me, I know haha
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-29 00:35:35	Need to clean up the passing #USMNT. #USAvCHI
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-29 00:37:02	Watching the game standing, because it just feels right. #USAvCHI
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-29 00:40:36	What is the defense doing?
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-29 00:42:19	Nguyen's sweet spot. Only person I can see that doing better is Rowe... or Jones.
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-01-29 02:57:29	Just driving along in #GTAV and Backstreet Boys comes on the radio bahahaha
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-02 03:19:31	@AlexiLalas GK coming up for the corner, misses it badly, and team couter attacks and wins!
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-01 14:39:21	I love how my Live Extra app is useless now. All I wanted to do was watch soccer on the way to the cape
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-01 17:11:55	Not two seconds that the music was playing #TheCrownPrincess is singing
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-07 04:36:35	Ugh, so tired. Sorry #GTAOnline, it's sleepy time.
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-09 20:15:57	Just checked the CONCACAF Champs League tourney, DC United looks in good shape to get to the top. Traditional heavies from Mexico are absent
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-15 22:14:34	Oh just playing #FIFA15. 3 teams in one career? Sure. I've killed off AC Milan for the near future, onto RC Lens in France. Muahahahaha
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-15 23:39:20	Picture from @ESPNFC 's article on MLS CBA talks puts commissioner in a "I'm not sure if I'm a bad or good guy" light http://t.co/Va21Ed4Iev
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-19 03:03:57	Wooohoooo! @SoundersFC preseason match! http://t.co/1cd4Y4pudO
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-22 00:54:17	Missing Alston's mop of a hairdo. Easy to pick him out then
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-24 01:59:06	Uh, I wish I could put the request day off for the #CrownPrince's wedding now, so I don't need to remember in a week.
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-27 00:20:36	#TheCrownPrince just did one of his trademark death stares.
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-27 00:21:44	And he almost scored too! Still more to be played...
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-27 00:22:53	#TheCrownPrince SCORES!
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-27 00:29:43	And #TheCrownPrince is getting a little feisty out there...
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-27 00:53:28	Tempers flaring on #TheCrownPrince's team, and speaking of which, scores again!
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-02-28 03:07:40	Whelp, I guess #TheCrownPrince hashtag is gone for familial uses. I can just tweet at/about him in a direct way now... @CrownPrinceSC
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-03-08 15:55:56	Curious to know what time #SEAvNE kickoff time is. I'm guessing the TV time listed is for total broadcast (pre-game + game itself).
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-03-08 16:06:28	And all I needed to do was look at my email. Thank goodness I'm an ECS member. Kick-off is at 9:30 EST. FOX is doing something right...
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-03-09 02:56:21	The amoeba is in good form and without Jones or Nyugen, its tough for the Revs to look threatening. Only the first game though... #SEAvNE
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-03-09 03:07:26	"I'm Clint Dempsey, please stand back." -@AlexiLalas #FreeKickConvos
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-03-11 01:00:41	Uh, yeah. #CitiesSkylines is so much fun. Less of a learning curve than another game I know. Single player first was a good call by the way!
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-03-12 22:37:38	Doing my first heist with @PaulCaito. Maybe @bcaito14 will join us when he gets home!? #GTAOnlineHeists
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-03-15 03:02:16	I really want to listen to people talk about movies just because Jaws is on TV. Welp, I might have a headache now due to all the yelling
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-03-25 20:43:21	Jozy and Aron both score goals? Is it Christmas? #USMNT #DENvUSA
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-03-25 20:49:23	Rimando may have great reflexes, but scares me every time he throws/kicks the ball and is deflected immediately by the opposing forward
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-03-25 21:07:50	Whoops. #USMNT
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-04-05 02:39:07	Disappointed I have to listen to the Dynamo broadcast teams. Got around it by downloading #KIRO app and streaming alongside video...
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-04-05 02:40:10	I just don't like listening to non-British accents doing a play-by-play. Yuck. Home team should have #MLSLive broadcast. Or the choice.
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-04-07 23:05:34	That time when you and your online avatar have similar blackeyes. #GTAOnline @bcaito14
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-04-11 15:50:36	Apparently easy passes are hard for Spurs.
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-04-16 02:19:06	...Just getting to the #USMNT game now. Um. Surface? Looks like crap.
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-04-17 00:19:02	Got bored with gta (no heist crew on tonight) so I'm catching up on #BlackSails. Oh and probably some #CitiesSkylines
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-04-26 16:52:34	I'm not sure what's more painful to watch right now... Chelsea sitting around or Arsenal missing near point blank chances... #ARSv CHE
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-04-27 01:09:16	I'm going to need a bigger table/desk soon. Just need the big heli and snowmobile and it'll be complete @LEGO_Group http://t.co/gECBvtoO6P
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-04-27 02:36:47	@FOXSoccer wondering if there's anyway you could move the #CCLfinal to FS1 for those without the channel? #IJustWantToWatchOnTV
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-04-29 14:16:19	Still disappointed I won't be able to watch the #CCLonFOX because it's on #FoxSports2. Bleh
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-05-02 00:48:49	@bcaito14 lol nice!
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-05-02 20:33:44	@RockstarSupport My daily objectives did not reset today, I submitted a ticket... here's my ticket number: #3842300. Thanks!
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-05-03 23:28:00	Classic Clint Dempsey head shake of disapproval. @bcaito14
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-05-03 01:51:22	@bcaito14 guess who has the daily objective problem now... #comeonrockstar
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-05-03 01:53:54	@bcaito14 i haven't checked. but mine are frozen now, even sent in a ticket for it...
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-05-04 01:06:42	Loving the jabs of "a bigger field" from...well everyone. #NYCvSEA
94620632	ThomCaito	2015-05-04 01:08:58	Regarding the New York Derby next weekend... isn't it really NJ v NY? You know...since the #RedBulls play in Harrison, NJ? #JustSayin
