948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-11-28 05:27:09	Still no news on CP3 's exit...was rubbing right hammy on way out, looks like. #Clippers
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-11-28 05:35:49	For the year? Please? RT @Al_Iannazzone: Kenyon returning. If he doesn't pick up two more fouls Ama're might be (should be) done for night.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-11-28 05:37:02	Collison DESTROYING the #Knicks last few minutes. #Clippers
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-11-28 05:44:06	It sounds crazy, but 'Melo needs to take literally every shot. The ball is unsafe with anyone else on this entire roster. #Knicks
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-11-28 05:51:18	The #Knicks wasting 'Melo's great season so far reminds me of the #Lakers blowing Kobe's revival last year...

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-14 23:29:01	Ummm, so yeah, I'm back from hibernation. It's the #Knicks fault...
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-14 23:30:12	Glad to see I missed nothing being gone for a bit. #Knicks still losing...#Lakers still in-fighting...grass still green. #NBA
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-15 00:45:25	JR Smith should really take that blindfold off he's been wearing if he's going to be shooting a basketball... #Knicks

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-15 02:47:04	It feels like so long ago since the team fed Melo because he was feeling it, not out of desperation... #Knicks
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-15 02:48:36	Melo has 35, 6 boards, 4 dimes, 2 steals... #Knicks
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-15 02:49:44	JR Smith could be getting to know that bench better than ever before if Tim Jr, Iman and Pablo keep this up. #Knicks

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 02:03:10	...but then they pissed off LeBron. He is violently aggressive right now on both ends, pulls #Heat with 5. This 4th Q gunna be REAL. #NBA
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 02:28:13	Can we just get the #Heat and #Pacers to play every game the rest of the way? #NBA

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 02:41:38	What a #Heat rally, they take a 97-94 win over #Pacers
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 03:02:12	Thoughts from #Knicks #Bucks : 1) Game is brutal 2) Are Iman and JR shooting 11% this season or is it me 3) Chandler's beard is Harden-esque
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 03:05:45	It's like, even when the #Knicks move the ball it doesn't look right.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 03:10:58	This is ridiculous. How can Woodson keep letting J.R.shoot? He's terrible. If the #Knicks are going to take bad shots, just let Melo take em
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 03:22:02	That's weird, Mike Woodson just took a late timeout... #Knicks #Bucks
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 03:23:42	#Knicks offensive options: 1) Melo 2) JR Smith airballs from arc and Shumpert wild drives where he falls down and throws the ball wherever.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 03:25:18	Melo says that was his last one...RT @ScottCacciola: That was a great play for Udrih. Just couldn't convert.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 03:27:12	OT in #Knicks #Bucks...It's the anti Heat-Pacers in Milwaukee right now... #NBA
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 03:33:40	Great shot by Udrih? Woodson says, "take a seat son, give J.R. some time out there..." #Knicks
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 03:36:20	I laughed hard at this joke. Box score check. Now I'm crying.RT @Al_Iannazzone: JR Smith has scored 17 points and taken 17 three-pointers.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 03:39:49	This #Knicks #Bucks OT is not going to make ESPN Classic I don't think...
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 03:41:40	If they combined these #Knicks and #Bucks rosters into one team, they might actually be worse... #NBA
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 03:55:13	Mike Woodson having trouble knowing when to sit terrible players, take timeouts and now how substitution works... #Knicks #NBA
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-19 04:12:32	You want horror? Peek at JR's stats. RT @AschNBA: Knicks up 7, :26.4 left in 2OT. They're 38 of 101. 'Melo 29 shots for 28 pts. The horror.

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-17 00:14:42	Why is it funny? Because sometimes #NBA teams would like players to not be blind. RT Gay admitted he couldn't legally see before this season

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-17 02:06:35	So here we go with LeBron's headband again, eh? #NBA
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-17 02:15:47	That's eight 3s ... still in the third quarter .. for J-J-J-J-Joe Johnson. #Nets #Sixers
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-17 02:17:57	That's nine 3s for Joe...career high. #Nets
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-17 02:18:59	10 3s for Joe. #Nets
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-17 02:21:53	Nope. 10 threes. RT @NBA: Joe Johnson is video game-hot right now. SEVEN 3-pointers in the 3rdQ alone, 9 for the game, he's got 34pts!
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-17 02:26:04	Looks like Joe's done...on bench for 4th so far #Nets
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-17 02:43:37	Well, it was nice to see the old JR back for at least those two consecutive shots in the middle of the game... #Yikes #Knicks
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-17 02:44:38	On the other hand, man, Melo so sweet. His open 3 pulls #Knicks back too within 92-90 vs. #Wizards...under 4 left
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-17 02:51:14	Spoke too soon? JR hits consecutive 3s for the second time, puts #Knicks back up 98-94...2 min left
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-17 02:59:42	What the hell was that ending by Melo and the #Knicks?!?!
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-17 03:47:18	Here's "take &amp; run with it" quote of night by Melo on Woodson not calling timeout for last shot: "If he says it's his fault, it's his fault"
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-28 05:48:12	Who knew it? Cousins gives out some postgame handshakes. #Kings drop #Heat ... Sactown happy tonight.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-29 00:30:00	This has to be a joke. RT @HerringWSJ: No. 46.7% score rate. RT @peepyiopee: @HerringWSJ is there a tm that finishes less on break than NYK?
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-29 00:41:31	The 46% fastbreak finish rate @HerringWSJ noted about the #Knicks is insane. That's the NBA version of missing half your dunks on a 6' hoop.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-29 00:56:24	Somehow, the #Knicks have five guys back on defense and manage to cover none of the three perimeter shooters or two forwards in the paint.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-29 01:39:35	The Hawks might be (or had been before the Al injury) the 3rd best team in the league, but they might be the most boring team to watch.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-29 01:42:21	Ever notice that none of the former key role players for the #Knicks whove made their way to Toronto ever get on the floor for the #Raptors?
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-29 02:01:23	Why is Mike Woodson even wasting time practicing anymore? His squad looks like a YMCA pickup team come game time. #Knicks
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2013-12-29 02:14:47	You know a teams' season isnt good when a score makes you cringe cause you know it'll only lead to 8 straight ill-advised misses. #JRSmith

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-14 04:28:50	…And Kevin Harlan is definitely ready to be "entertained" for one. #NBA #AllStar #KevinHart

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 00:52:48	LeBron? KD? Who ya got?!?! Up next on #TNTOT on @NBAonTNT #Heat #OKC
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 01:01:27	Oooh gawd, what the hell is this intro music to this #Heat #OKC game?!?!
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 01:17:17	Only thing that could make Kevin Harlan more pumped up for the #Heat vs #OKC game is if Kevin Hart was screeching into  the mic next to him.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 01:21:37	Ok, so LeBron opens the game by scoring all 10 #Heat points?!?! Whoa.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 01:22:55	Bronny might score 50 tonight... #Heat
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 01:31:18	#Heat letting #Thunder know who the champs right now...
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 01:41:46	KD's been invisible so far tonight... #OKC #Heat
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 01:43:37	Durant is 1-for-3 with 2 pts after 1 Q in biggest game of the year. Doesn't exactly scream "MVP" #Heat #OKC
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 01:44:05	LeBron on the other hand, looks like, well LeBron...
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 02:22:53	Russ Wes has pulled #OKC back into this thing at the half...
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 02:31:01	Chuck is right on #TNT right now. LeBron, if it keeps this course, just wiped the MVP floor with KD tonight. #Heat #OKC
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 02:31:09	Still a half left though...
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 02:53:56	D-Wade droppin #OKC bodies all of a sudden... #Heat
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 02:55:44	Wade with the patended Miami Heat move, "get called for foul then streak across court in disbelief"...
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 02:59:37	Is this really goin' be a straight whooping all night? #Heat #OKC
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 03:00:28	That's 30 for LeBron...13 for Durant. #OKC #Heat
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 03:19:26	Talk of the fall of the champs has obviously been misguided misjudgement. #Heat #OKC
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-02-21 03:35:18	How about LeBron got his face smashed and started gushing blood on the drive AND THEN FINISHED THE DUNK!!! #Heat #OKC

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-04-19 00:36:38	Sorry people, the NBA stars of today would score half the points they do now in the 80s, and the guys from the 80s would score twice as many

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-04-20 00:31:51	I love how Roy Hibbert is this beast that's going to finally derail the Heat all year long. Except,by the way, he can't stop Pero Antic. Ha.

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-04-20 04:00:36	Funny when TV pundits talk about how Derek Fisher or Steve Kerr could be the #Knicks next coach. NYK could actually still use them on court.

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-05-20 23:28:53	@boalsr21 Yup. And also the Rockets. Good draft to unload all your picks before...
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-05-20 23:30:05	@boalsr21 Oh, and also, the Nuggets have the KNicks' 2016 first-rounder too...So there's that.

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-05-20 23:44:23	So, @boalsr21 @USFCollin @Eric_Kenny5 ... I know it won't be in the lottery, but where does Victor Rudd end up? #NBADraft #USF
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-05-20 23:48:21	@USFCollin @boalsr21 @Eric_Kenny5 I could see Rudd on simliar path to Dominique Jones. I think he's got way more upside, and so do NBA teams
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-05-20 23:54:59	@USFCollin @boalsr21 @Eric_Kenny5 Those things are true, but Jones never had anything to offer in the potential/athlete dept like Rudd does.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-05-20 23:55:15	@USFCollin @boalsr21 @Eric_Kenny5 And that can at least get a guy a chance...

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2014-11-29 02:50:16	Why hasn't 'Melo thrived in this new Knicks triangle yet? Because he's playing with guys that are good enough to score 40 in 3Q without him.

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-03-29 03:00:50	Hate to blame somebody but Jerian Grant lost that game for the Irish. Never gave the ball away on last 3 ND possessions and took 3 bad shots
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-03-29 03:02:00	Dude looked like Jose Calderon out there...
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-03-29 03:26:54	Back to my school, congrats again to another big win by @USFBaseball
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-03-29 03:44:50	Thunder lost, but BOY, is Russell Westbrook more likely to punch someone than he normally is...
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-03-30 23:36:26	Downtown Atlanta, take care of ya boy @hartzellNBA tonight. Don't sell him those fake tickets for #Hawks vs. #Bucks !!!
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-03-30 23:37:39	@ToughLoveSports Upon video review, Dunston said: "Don't make me pull a muthafuckin Martinez on you in BB golf, bruh!"
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-03-30 23:39:20	@hartzellNBA I know a homeless guy who cooks top burgers out of a shopping cart by the rr tracks if you already blew cash on those "tickets"
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-03-30 23:44:35	To the #MiamiOpen, outside the 7-footedness, the 8-inch high tops &amp; the ball bouncing between the legs, how is Isner not playing basketball?

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-03-31 00:45:46	Hartzell has his pulse on the kids' lingo RT @hartzellNBA: @nm4agoodlife @corydalin very cool, very hip lingo. And the answer is YES. I DID.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-03-31 01:54:49	@hartzellNBA Don't fret, BABs available post-game, too!!!
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-03-31 01:55:49	Can't believe i just hyphenated "postgame"...I'm keeping that up as a lesson in failure.

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-01 02:06:07	Jumping over to the news I'm so late on, too bad Mike White couldn't make it at USF, good kid, and hope things go well for him...
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-01 02:06:58	But, real talk, hopefully this means the end of the "Wave the White Flag" era at USF -- anytime that poor overmatched kid was on the field.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-01 02:39:26	Guy's got a plan, what can I say... RT @35_Fitz: Think I'll make an Email to hear some of these ideas and business plans.

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-02 23:30:12	What a freaking Wednesday night in the NBA, ps...here's to hoping Thursday is a bit chiller. Literally for my sake.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-03 00:12:43	Wow, LeBron actually drove a Kia to the #Cavs #Heat game tonight. The "Darling of Ad Execs Everywhere" ball is in your court, Blake Griffin.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-03 03:15:19	Nice from @Barryathree on @NBAonTNT broadcast about GSW leading so many NBA categories: "The @warriors have more No 1s than The Beatles."
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-03 05:21:31	Seriously, how are you going to beat the Warriors in the playoffs?

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-13 02:31:14	Congrats to @JackSock on 1st ATP title today. Been watching this young gun since I played in his 1st draw in '09 in Mobile, AL Futures event
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:22:29	Knicks vs. Magic just dropped the worst scoring quarter in NBA history...SEASON ALMOST OVER DUDES! http://t.co/nDBU81luxR
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:27:32	@boalsr21 Ouch. I stopped watching the Knicks already, it's brutal. I have to go in person vs. the Hawks on Monday and am dreading it.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:29:22	@boalsr21 The sad things is the Hawks 3rd stringers will mop the floor with the Knicks.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:38:34	@boalsr21 I actually want them to trade them. Despite our awful history, Phil actually knows what he's doing. I want Cousins.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:40:35	@boalsr21 All it would take is Cousins saying, I want out.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:41:01	@boalsr21 We could get him easy, if we take on his whole salary and give them back Hardaway, whoever else and 2 picks or something.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:41:42	@boalsr21 With this year's loaded draft, that pick is worth a lot, even f it ends up being No. 2
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:42:54	@boalsr21 Guys still want to go to the market, and dudes love 'Melo. He's still a top star, so that's attractive for guys.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:43:32	@boalsr21 The KNicks have a ton of money to spend, if Phil does even an OK job, with Melo back they'll make the playoffs in the East...
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:43:52	@boalsr21 Look at the Celtics...they're a freaking college team and they're going to make it.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-13 03:57:30	The Thunder are just a thrill a minute to follow. The playoffs will miss their hijinx...
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:44:07	@boalsr21 Definitely
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:44:41	@boalsr21 I really hope not. But if guys start turning him down we'll overpay for him. That's my nightmare. He's not that good.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:46:35	@boalsr21 Hes going to want more money than he's worth. It's easy to average 17 on a bad team. Freaking Bargnani is averaging like 20 for us
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:48:54	@boalsr21 Nikky V is actually a good player that fits in any system &amp; does things most can't. Harris is a gunslinger-dime a dozen in the NBA
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:50:44	@boalsr21 If they let Harris walk, save that money and end up with Justise you guys will have really won the day.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 00:51:42	@boalsr21 Yessir
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-12 01:29:10	Love your stuff, &amp; he was a nice kid, but no. Not even an AAC level QB. USF needs someone that can actually move. https://t.co/mxVuuMJFJl

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-25 23:20:37	The way the Long Islanders brought it in the 3rd and postgame in that crowd made me proud to be #StrongIsland

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-25 03:26:59	@boalsr21 No way, they owe that dude $50 MILLION if they fire him. He's got a loooong time left to lose 1st round series' in LA.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-04-25 03:28:49	@boalsr21 Oh yeah, their owner gives zero f-words.

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-15 03:02:44	@Eric_Kenny5 You needa make a layover in Waco, Texas before visiting my homeland of Italia. Drink an espresso and a Moretti beer for me!
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-15 03:11:45	We need Ws from every Bull on court right now. Git 'em @USFBullsMTennis. #USF #Tennis https://t.co/0YdOCK4mgn
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-15 03:14:45	@boalsr21 There's a small chance. Honestly, I hate to say this, Cid our top player has been terrible tonight.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-15 03:15:58	@boalsr21 He's still got the singles tourney too. But this is the worst I've ever seen him play. Hitting it like an old man out there.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-15 03:20:42	@boalsr21 We are really in this. Have a great shot to win the other 2 matches. Cid is key. He beat No 1 in nation in '14. Can do it again.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-15 03:22:44	@boalsr21 I think he's hurt or something. Match point Baylor, 6-5 in 2nd, down a set.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-15 03:23:56	@boalsr21 Double faulted on match point. Something wrong. He looked so dead. Hes No 24 in the nation. You don't double fault on match point.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-16 03:26:05	Curry is not a human being
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-15 03:27:19	Great effort. Hope Cid gets rest &amp; is ready for the NCAA singles. Good luck to Pramming/Roberts in dubs tourney too. https://t.co/jtGSqydThV
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-16 01:35:17	OOPS

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-16 01:49:44	I mean, it's still ridiculous that he hit this. Would have easily been the hardest of his big-shot run... #TheTruth https://t.co/KJY2dVVZAy
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-16 02:07:05	@Eric_Kenny5 Dude is a freaking machine.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-16 02:08:49	@Eric_Kenny5 He hates everyone and is just pure evil, which is awesome.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-16 02:09:19	@Eric_Kenny5 YA HEARDDDDD
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-24 01:21:42	...and wait for it...
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-24 01:25:51	For real, that guy... https://t.co/BneqdHfP8X
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-24 02:02:04	...and there it is. Curry with the new postseason 3s record.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-24 02:06:58	The scary thing Rockets fans probably don't want to hear is they probably already played their two best games of this series.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-24 02:09:57	@boalsr21 Before it started...at least it's not as bad as the Hawks situation. Yikes. You'll never see another 1 seed get whooped like this.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-24 02:12:47	@boalsr21 Yeah. The Hawks REALLY never had a chance. Can't beat a LeBron team without one legit consistent scorer.

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-25 04:12:06	Yup, @KennyTheJET comparing LeBron to "Criss Angel" on @NBAonTNT is easily the best thing to come from Game 3.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-25 01:32:55	See ya, Big Al ... #Hawks
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-05-25 01:46:25	It's insane that people are freaking over this. Horford threw a freaking giant elbow. He missed so no big deal?!?! https://t.co/nsd1ucYwyr

948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-06-17 01:11:03	Since the end of Game 5 LeBron has looked like he bout to bring it. We'll see... #NBAFinals
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-06-17 05:08:00	Interesting that after all talk about LeBron's motivation, when he said he's best in the world that motivated the Warriors a lot obviously.
948811094	nm4agoodlife	2015-06-18 03:51:05	In #AllBall, the #Clippers look to change it up, dropping a new logo on the world for '15-16: http://t.co/cosyC4p5i3 http://t.co/DBeuzPsOJi
