94913672	kaieous	2014-04-06 00:40:06	saw a poster that said "all men must die" but i was disappointed to find they meant mankind
94913672	kaieous	2014-04-06 01:31:58	@yourrigisred ALL OF THEM
94913672	kaieous	2014-04-06 01:32:38	@yourrigisred idk i just thought gender eradication would make for a more interesting poster than "everyone dies"
94913672	kaieous	2014-04-06 01:37:19	.@ThisNotName kindly saw off your penis, sautee it in a pan with some butter and fresh garlic, mince into fine pieces and enjoy your meal!
94913672	kaieous	2014-04-06 01:42:31	while "kill all men" is not a reasonable thing to say, @ThisNotName seems to think "kill all feminists" is.
94913672	kaieous	2014-04-06 01:46:43	@ThisNotName Evil? But I just gave you a delicious recipe for pan-fried men's rights! Don't tell me you don't trust a woman's cooking?
94913672	kaieous	2014-04-06 01:53:44	@ThisNotName Yes! Why would men killing each other not fill me with joy when I have you as an example?
94913672	kaieous	2014-04-06 02:01:48	@OMGITSYELENA haha thank you.
94913672	kaieous	2014-04-06 02:06:31	@yourrigisred @_doomsayer_ Irrelevant. All groups have extremists.
94913672	kaieous	2014-04-06 02:12:18	@_doomsayer_ @yourrigisred Women who identify as feminists are labeled as hysterical... you see why it's problematic to abandon the term.

94913672	kaieous	2014-04-08 21:29:52	which you did by typing "fav theirusername" and if they tweeted again you missed it

94913672	kaieous	2014-06-12 22:33:12	@yourrigisred mermaid with legs is the worst thing that happened
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 15:47:06	@yourrigisred dont hide!! cons are a magical chance to meet new people thats why everyone is there :)
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 15:47:40	@yourrigisred youre soo cute, just tidy up a little dont go crazy!
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 15:56:30	@MasterKeyX It's a hoax, the reaction to it is keeping it trending. Saw a screenshot suggesting it started on 4chan.
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 15:58:25	I'm offended at whoever started that End Father's Day "joke" and tried to slap feminist buzzwords on it for attention. #EndBeingAnAsshole
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 15:59:58	It's really pissing me off. "Feminists will love this!" Feminists are nowhere near supporting this. Fuck you. #EndBeingAnAsshole
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 16:02:01	@MasterKeyX for the purpose of being offensive and blaming feminism. It's gross.
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 16:04:15	@MasterKeyX seriously fucking #End4chan
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-10 23:51:03	On a date! :) I think I'll keep him. (@ The @SpottedPigNyc w/ 5 others) http://t.co/YnvyAJvHll

94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 18:22:54	repeat after me kids: marijuana is only a "gateway" drug because you have to go to a drug dealer to get it.
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 18:30:37	I think it's SO funny when I'm talking to customer service and they refer to the account holder - my dad - as a "she" bc his name is Jan.
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 18:31:19	"Well we would have to speak to Jan, can you get her?" Jan is a 6 foot 3, 300lb Norwegian man.
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 01:04:40	So you can just do scary stuff and be fine after?
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 01:44:06	@MasterKeyX tbh i read rhat and immediately assumed they were talking about the geico "so easy" caveman
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 01:49:46	@MasterKeyX i dont really understand how its sexist out of context either though, just seems like meaningless drabble
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-11 03:52:22	practically falling asleep on the toilet. willing myself to move the 10 feet to my bed.

94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 22:07:01	@FEE1DEADD what. I've never heard of that either. My mom goes by Chris (though it is short for Christine) so they're Chris and Jan lol

94913672	kaieous	2014-06-14 04:59:50	@Dojorkan The 9/11 memorial has a gift shop. It's gross and offensive.
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-14 06:11:44	@yourrigisred :( sorry dude.
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-14 06:12:37	I want a @GOPTeens shirt and as a plus I think my parents would be SO confused to see me wearing it.

94913672	kaieous	2014-06-14 06:34:14	@yourrigisred less people more booze sounds a+ to me
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 01:56:07	@MasterKeyX I just dont understand how it is sexism. Rude and kind of silly but how does it further enforce gender roles? does he hunt?
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 02:00:48	@MasterKeyX I didn't see that bc the quote is about a specific guy. If it were "I like my men to be like cavemen" then I'd have gotten it.
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 02:01:16	@MasterKeyX Otherwise I'm just assuming he's hairy but also hot, lol.
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 02:05:04	@MasterKeyX I understand the point, I just didn't see your original quote that way out of context so we disagreed on the example.
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 02:07:51	@MasterKeyX it's not about women at all, so it's def not misogyny. I see how you would argue a caveman as a traditional gender role though.
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 02:32:26	can my tv work tonight bc i dont have my computer so i like really need the tv to work
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-13 02:33:49	ugh smarthub is updating come on this takes 9ever

94913672	kaieous	2014-06-19 05:25:47	@yourrigisred he was actually being positive about it and complaining about going to work at the 9/11 memorial, which is a legit shithole ..
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-19 05:26:28	@yourrigisred but i suppose i do see how you misread the initial tweet. your mistake.

94913672	kaieous	2014-06-19 21:28:54	@emmiesunshine if its not a part of their reality, it cant exist. "I would never say that to a woman, so no men would!"

94913672	kaieous	2014-06-30 22:30:53	if your sale is "select styles only" and "discount taken at register" then fuck you honestly
94913672	kaieous	2014-06-30 22:32:14	what that means is "imma let you fall in love with this in the hopes that it's cheap but it wont be" so you either pay more or leave upset

94913672	kaieous	2014-08-22 04:16:26	@yourrigisred yep, one crazy lady totally represents Feminism. You sure got us there.
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-22 04:19:43	@yourrigisred You should know feminism well enough not to make broad, false statements about it. Feminism is attacked enough as it is.
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-22 04:21:51	@yourrigisred What you needed was to be less specific. She's not a feminist. She's a crazy lady.
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-22 04:22:19	@yourrigisred That was a joke. Your post was serious.
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-22 04:24:14	@yourrigisred But you didn't put "feminist" in quotes at the time. Or make any attempt with your remaining characters to specify.
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-22 04:24:41	@yourrigisred You literally just said "Feminism is a joke." and it isn't.
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-22 04:25:44	@yourrigisred Or you can delete the tweet now and try again. As it stands, it's heinous and reflects poorly on you.

94913672	kaieous	2014-08-23 17:05:45	@manddddddee it's amazing how the best things in beauty are literally ancient. nothing is new that actually works.
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-23 17:26:27	im kinda pissed one of my bosses likes to talk shit. theres no reason to tell other employees im shy and emotional. im sure theyll see it.
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-23 17:27:58	and anyway, i want to work with animals because i am shy and emotional. this isnt sales or the damn military. dogs dont give a shit im shy.

94913672	kaieous	2014-08-26 17:47:35	apparently @taylorswift13 had a "feminist awakening" but i won't believe it until she apologizes for the girl hate in her music

94913672	kaieous	2014-08-26 20:37:47	@BennyD13 definitely look into hypoallergenic breeds - we have westies in my house and theyre great dogs. lotsa spunk. would recommend.
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-26 20:43:21	@BennyD13 hypoallergenic large dogs exist, theyre just rare breeds ($$$) but dogs are different, you may be allergic to some and not others.
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-26 20:49:50	i think it's like a common thing for men to be averted to smaller dog breeds bc they dont realize theyre not all yappy, shaky yorkie types
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-26 20:51:07	we got princess (westie, ~25lb dog) because you could kick her and she wouldnt even fall over. theyre tough. except winston he's a wuss.
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-26 20:52:02	all dogs have their personalities. i think its more important to meet a specific dog before you adopt than it is to choose the right breed.
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-26 20:54:57	i think a lot of people get caught up in the idea of a golden or a lab and do not have the time, space or energy for one. sad for the dog.
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-26 20:56:00	@BennyD13 good idea! whatever you choose, i hope you opt for adoption from a shelter or rescue!
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-26 20:56:40	another thing i dont understand: outdoor cats. but thats a rant for another time.
94913672	kaieous	2014-08-26 21:06:20	one last comment about breeds. dont get trendy dogs. shibas are notoriouslu difficult to care for. dont let a meme decide your pet.

94913672	kaieous	2014-09-02 07:04:25	if you want a teacup pig, get a guinea instead. they're supposed to be that size and still have tiny cute noses.

94913672	kaieous	2014-09-24 02:50:01	@CJdufrene @akileev this just in: clothing determines gender. i wore my dad's sweatshirt today, i am a 50 year old man.
94913672	kaieous	2014-09-24 02:53:33	@akileev I think we are genuinely misunderstanding each other because that made absolutely no sense to me.
94913672	kaieous	2014-09-24 03:00:44	@akileev I disagree, but if you're respecting people, that's ok with me. Unlike @cjdufrene who thinks transwomen are out to get him.

94913672	kaieous	2014-10-28 00:18:28	the idea that women don't want to or shouldn't want to "get bulky" when lifting weights bothers me SO MUCH
94913672	kaieous	2014-10-28 00:19:32	for one, it is incredibly difficult to bulk up. it takes a lot of intentional training and diet work. you will not accidentally gain muscle.
94913672	kaieous	2014-10-28 00:20:47	but even more importantly, WHY THE HELL NOT?! so you can look soft, weak and fragile? because muscles are "manly"? do you hear yourselves???
94913672	kaieous	2014-10-28 00:21:43	"oh i dont want to get stronger men wont like me if they are intimidated by me" THOSE MEN ARE WEAK YOU DO NOT WANT THEM
94913672	kaieous	2014-10-28 00:27:27	@yourrigisred im sure many men are intimidated by her. men who are afraid of a woman they can't push around. (she is hella cute though)
94913672	kaieous	2014-10-28 23:13:42	for some reason reality tv with people living in the wild is a new trend and as contradictory as that is i think its really cool
94913672	kaieous	2014-10-28 23:14:17	possibly even good for us as a society, to integrate a love of nature into our use of technology.

94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 01:55:32	new kid teased me for listening to avenged sevenfold while cleaning...... glad he didnt come upstairs during Babs Seed.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 02:17:05	@yourrigisred @MasterKeyX catcalling is harassment. if you catcalled generally, like yelling "WOMEN HAVE NICE BUTTS," that'd be free speech.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 02:35:22	@yourrigisred @MasterKeyX People don't have a right to harass other people???? They do not.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 02:40:02	@yourrigisred harassment is literally already a crime. it is enforced with restraining orders.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 02:50:46	@yourrigisred you're a white man. you have nothing to fear in confrontation. others need protection. i imagine you've never been catcalled.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 02:51:51	@yourrigisred regardless of whether the system works, no one has a RIGHT to harass other people. Do they? of fucking course they do.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 02:52:31	rlly hate when people's arguments literally just don't consider experiences other than their own
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 02:57:14	@yourrigisred says the person who dismisses MY arguments as cliches. catcalling isnt what freedom of speech is for either, hun.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 02:57:49	@yourrigisred i have a right to not feel threatened and objectified when i walk out of the house, more than anyone has a right to harass me.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 02:58:13	@yourrigisred of course honey it never does :) :) :)
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 03:01:40	@yourrigisred no i have a right to exist without being harassed for it. that trumps anyone else's rights.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 16:27:24	the worst thing about the @MarinasDiamonds preorder is that it's going to take 6 months to get the album. otherwise, rad as hell!
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 03:02:11	@yourrigisred freedom of speech exists to speak out against wrongdoing, not to force your shitty sexist opinions on women.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 03:02:45	@yourrigisred yes and some interactions are fucking wrong like rape and murder and theft and harassment.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 03:06:03	@yourrigisred you do know there are actual parameters to harassment right. or are you exclusively a talking ass.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 03:06:20	@yourrigisred harassment is threatening by definition.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 03:12:06	@yourrigisred no, no it can't. i don't know where the fuck you got your definition of harassment but that isn't it.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 03:12:35	@yourrigisred if you repeatedly, personally, directly attacked him for his views, that os harassment. it's really not subjective.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 03:13:17	@yourrigisred you're operating under a definition of harassment that i'm pretty sure is only shared by horribly insecure teenagers.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 03:13:40	@yourrigisred but of course, that makes sense.....
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 03:29:25	"laws are meaningless but i fully understand an issue that disproportionately affects not me because i looked it up in the dictionary"
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 03:29:57	there's a reason i usually only engage nick in intelligent discussion. he's one of the few people i know who are capable of it.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 04:24:30	yeah i dont think im going to be able to make this work meeting because i have an interview to not work here anymore
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 04:38:07	people who can't form coherent arguments make me cranky..... also coworkers who swear everything is done when it is not.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 04:42:29	eminem is a shitty person but tbh i want to punch lana del ray too.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 04:46:57	@KaylaFollese you're excused.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 04:50:29	@KaylaFollese well since we're correcting people, it's *your. but my negative opinions about her are just as valid as your positive ones.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 04:51:13	@KaylaFollese I didn't reply to you to tell you you're wrong for liking her - though I do believe you are - so maybe you should pls back off
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 04:53:54	@KaylaFollese Right, because the English language is less important than your precious celebrity crush.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 04:55:23	if you're a woman who wants nothing to do with female empowerment, you do not deserve fame.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 04:59:22	.@KaylaFollese correct. also not the end of the world if i hate a celebrity you like! are you finally understanding the futility of it all?
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:02:20	@KaylaFollese Then I apologize that lana del ray means something to you. I can't deny she's talented, but she's an awful role model.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:03:11	@KaylaFollese Lana has a medieval view of a woman's place in society, and I think her fame is damaging to women's empowerment.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:04:02	@KaylaFollese I don't hate artists because I don't care for what they produce, I hate them for their politics.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:04:36	@KaylaFollese Famous people have a platform like no other. It's damaging to socoety as a whole for famous people to be so backwards.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:05:20	@KaylaFollese I'm a person that isn't famous and thinks critically about what I claim as my beliefs. I am thr opposite of her.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:06:20	@MasterKeyX NOPE. An adult got me angry, this teenager is honestly putting up a better fight.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:09:08	@MasterKeyX no I certainly won't.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:11:47	@KaylaFollese she personally thinks of women as useless and needing a man to take care of them. that's how i read her.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:12:30	@KaylaFollese while you won't change my mind, i respect your opinion + your right to enjoy whatever you like. personally i wanna punch her.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:14:08	@KaylaFollese in that case i hope you listen to her with a very selective ear. she is clearly a damaged individual, and you only want to
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:14:24	@KaylaFollese learn from her mistakes, not take on her toxic worldview.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:15:24	@KaylaFollese it may also be important for you to realize that people who are special to you are not infallible. you love her; she is flawed
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:20:54	@KaylaFollese i wish you the best with that. i hope you are/become a strong and independent woman. it's good that you fight for what you
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:21:42	@KaylaFollese believe is right and i have to thank you for being more reasonable than i expected. have a good night.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:23:43	@KaylaFollese ugh, spoke too soon about you being reasonable. but i guess i have to expect some immaturity. still wish you the rest.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:31:38	... do people think i hate fans of the artists i hate? because i don't. unless you like chris brown ill judge you for that.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:34:01	i just really get angry about misused fame. famous people have a responsibility to at LEAST not damage impprtant social movements.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-11 05:49:15	it smells good in my room and i have no idea why

94913672	kaieous	2014-11-12 17:20:13	I don't think I've ever seen a pickup truck signal
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-14 02:51:57	did not think MRAs and other antifeminists could get more heinous, and yet.... here 'meninism' is.

94913672	kaieous	2014-11-15 21:20:41	@MeninistTweet @manddddddee i see that you are following a meninist and kindly request that you think twice about this
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-15 21:50:22	@manddddddee @MeninistTweet good. don't. meninism is a toxic attempt to derail the real concerns of feminism.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-16 00:03:54	anyone have a small dog or a very tolerant cat and want a purple hoodie for them? aspen grew out of it.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-17 16:36:52	i sorta can't believe that peta straightup doesnt think people should have pets. dogs are literally better off with people than other dogs.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-17 16:38:37	i mean, i can believe it, because peta and team plasma are essentially the same thing. lets 'liberate hte pokemans' lets 'kill ppls animals'
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-16 01:24:00	damn maybe i should go back to school for zoology i have so much to learn.

94913672	kaieous	2014-11-21 08:01:36	is it a thing for two different dogs living together to call each other "big dog" and "little dog"?

94913672	kaieous	2014-11-25 02:43:19	@Mikeillus the jury was made up of 75% white people in a city where the majority of the population is black
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-25 02:47:38	@Mikeillus legally, they only needed a 75% decision actually. they purposely stacked it that way. unless a unanimous decision was reported?
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-25 02:48:04	@Mikeillus I am actually not in the country and can't really access much.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-25 02:55:22	@Mikeillus there is so much bullshit going around i don't think we're going to get details :/ either way a big disappointment in general.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-24 02:58:36	got into a heated argument at a hotel bar about how snape is a selfish character and while he explained his actions, did not redeem himself.

94913672	kaieous	2014-11-26 13:42:27	I will listen to opposing opinions. I will follow you and think about what you say. But I won't stand for racism on my feeds.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-26 13:43:49	I think that you can't expect unpunished violence not to beget more violence, but I respect those who argue there is no use in it.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-26 13:44:58	I can't respect the argument that shoplifting should be punishable by death, or that Wilson was intimidated by how "large" Mike Brown was.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-26 13:45:39	You and I both know he wasn't intimidated by the kid's height. Especially when he was on his knees and shot through the top of the skull.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-26 13:47:21	Alternatively, if you want to argue Darren Wilson was doing his job, I hope you really think hard about the words "serve and protect."
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-26 13:47:48	And then think about seeing a teenager's body lying in the street for almost five hours.

94913672	kaieous	2014-11-27 02:58:37	.@JustinBrosen @brandttx @MasterKeyX don't forget to unset your alarms from 5am like i almost did
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-29 20:15:50	making friends with stray animals is the actual worst because when they get adopted you basically never see them again
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-29 20:16:27	it's not like i can still hang out with buck or send texts to stella. their families don't understand that we are friends :(
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-29 20:48:07	one of these days i will get a job where i am paid better, respected and there are still animals. for now i will scrub blood off the floor.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-27 18:10:43	watching the dog show with my dogs. so thankful for puppy love in my life! http://t.co/4Bb6oR6L1X
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-27 18:16:38	say what you want about thanksgiving, but it is an overwhelmingly positive thing to have a day dedicated to the things we are grateful for.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-27 19:28:12	@BuzzFeed actually i think these guys look a lot better than typical guy selfies...
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-27 19:30:58	spoiling the heck out of every animal here because we are family today. extra blankets and treats and attention for all of ya!
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-30 04:49:41	the bad news is i am $28,854 in student debt. the good news is i brought home gifted champagne from my barely-over-minimum-wage job.
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-30 04:52:48	@brandttx what they mean is "career" but what they sound like is a douche
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-30 05:54:36	@tarastrong is being a brony edgy now?
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-29 04:25:56	@animalIife is there more on this story??
94913672	kaieous	2014-11-30 16:55:14	"@Canada: #DYK we exported $280M of maple syrup last year, and most of it was to the US?" canada just tagged us @sweetraritea @OMGITSYELENA

94913672	kaieous	2014-11-29 17:29:25	Has anyone who graduated in student debt in May gotten their first bill? I have no idea how this works but I assume I will get a bill?
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-01 00:01:41	what an annoying glitch @triviacrack "You lost the challenge 5-4!" did i now.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-01 00:24:56	yesterday my mom was like "i think we need another good week or two before we decorate for xmas" ... mom... no...
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-01 01:12:18	if i wanted to work exclusively nights on thursday saturday and sunday maybe i should have been a fucking bartender
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-01 01:59:50	@smicksssmack thank you for your frown
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-01 02:28:42	@smicksssmack no im sorry i understood that! i was thanking you for the support
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-01 03:05:10	NICK HAS NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF GRUMPY CAT WHAT ROCK HAS HE BUILT HIS LIFE UNDER
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-01 18:28:22	apparently my uncle drug tests his children and sent my cousin to group therapy for smoking pot. what on earth.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-01 03:56:04	Coming home after a rough day to find that the movie I DVR-ed and was looking forward to is somehow corrupted is my FAVORITE @VerizonFiOS
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-02 05:44:04	@weeddude if minimum wage workers can be recorded at work, cops sure as fuck should be
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-02 05:44:44	if you think cops shouldnt wear body cameras because of their precious privacy, you probably have no idea how little privacy you have.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-01 04:03:02	@VerizonSupport This time it decided that though the recording is clearly 2 hours long, I only get to see the last 20 minutes.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-01 04:03:41	@VerizonSupport However, my other recording is working - though it was interrupted while I reset the system. My bad.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-01 04:10:15	@VerizonSupport i dont think so. it had the "resume play" option but "play from start" started at the same spot and didnt let me rewind.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-01 04:22:16	in defense of @verizonfios, @verizonsupport got back to me really quickly.

94913672	kaieous	2014-12-02 19:27:33	my parents are yelling because i got upset after they sent me out to buy them bagels with no instruction and they complained abt what i got.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-03 03:32:23	picked up the overnight tonight which i am actually pretty happy about because 8 hours on the overnight differential is nothing to sneeze at
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-03 06:27:47	@ninajaybee only when i watch anime.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-03 06:42:01	@smicksssmack if you have a bong or bubbler i highly recommend hot water when you're sick. steeeeeamy.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-03 19:38:35	i really expected better from new york, especially in the wake of ferguson. this was manslaughter at the least. no indictment is bullshit.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-03 10:17:37	really cool how the dogs all wake up and shit in their cages the moment i begin to get tired.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 01:18:15	so apparently not only can cops not kill people (my dad says it's impossible), my mom is both misinformed and racist...
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 01:19:01	"Katie, they didn't indict that cop. Be safe outside tonight." "Why? I'm white." "Exactly. The blacks are going to go crazy."
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 01:33:52	"Maybe this will teach people to stay out of trouble, and to respect the law enforcement when they do." MOM YOU ARE A FASCIST.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 17:42:47	well, i dropped him off. im worried because he's my baby but he's in the best possible hands and ill be back in a few hours.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 06:03:59	i beat nick at trivia crack so many times he deleted the app ok
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 22:56:13	i know youre 80 and you have lots of experiences, but others have different ones that you cant understand. they always will.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 22:57:15	maybe think about your granddaughter when you say bill cosby's victims should have left him alone + he's "at the end of his career anyway"
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 23:42:11	i just really don't understand. the cop who killed eric garner knew he killed him. he felt guilt and panic over it. how did a jury disagree?
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 23:43:09	this wasnt a murder, it was a routine arrest that got out of hand. an accidental death caused by his actions. that is still a CRIME.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 23:44:55	we can't change the definition of a crime to suit law enforcement. this was manslaughter (as a result of lack of respect for garner ofc)
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 23:49:22	letting cops get away with crime - ANY crime - sends the wrong message. you are not above the law because you enforce it.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-05 01:39:10	.@playdots I HATE YOU AND LEVEL 84 IS IMPOSSIBLE
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 16:31:52	finally got over the exhaustion from doing the overnight and they need me to come in early :\ i was so useless yesterday they should pay me
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 22:53:37	if i hear one more white person tell a story about how they weren't killed by a cop and therefore black people must instigate them imma flip
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-05 04:29:26	anyone have any insights for a new vegetarian? it's been less than a week and im already tired of eggs and cheeee
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 23:45:37	the cops say, "well everyone tells us they can't breathe bc they want us to back off." garner was 600lns you didnt believe he had asthma???
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 23:48:08	if i hit someone with my car and they die, no matter how much i really did not want to kill them, i have committed manslaughter.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 23:51:09	i think that people who carry lethal weapons tend to develop an ego problem, even a god complex, since they have the ability to end a life.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-04 23:52:02	it's worse with the police. they are given authority and a weapon and are coddled by the government. they forget they are public servants.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-05 05:37:18	aspen is dog whining. he doesnt seem to be in actual pain, he's just cranky.

94913672	kaieous	2014-12-11 21:28:48	a remix of the Hanging Tree song from Mockingjay is playing in ihop right now?
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-11 21:30:31	this isnt a cutesy pop song why is it on the radio???
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-12 01:50:36	im really sick of my "potential." been told for my whole life how my personality and emotions are a detriment to my intelligence.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-12 01:54:11	emotion is passion is ambition. i've never really been motivated because no one ever fucking told me that.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-12 01:54:11	if i had a dollar for each time i heard "you're so smart, but..." i wouldn't be in student debt.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-12 01:54:11	no one ever told me - hey, you're emotional, you're a little out there. you can harness that energy for good.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-12 02:09:02	i'm gonna cry a lot and save some animal lives. get ready, new york city.

94913672	kaieous	2014-12-13 17:49:53	21 years old and still having dreams about being late for school
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-13 06:18:03	so i was really set on going to norway in the summer but with my student debt (even fully employed) i don't think i can actually afford it
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-13 06:19:43	however i probably can afford to take my snowy mountain dog to his namesake Aspen for his 1st birthday where we can hike and get high
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-13 06:21:40	aspen being essentially a large ski resort... is probably in its off-season in may/june? as in super cheap?

94913672	kaieous	2014-12-14 00:24:03	apparently this is hotly contested but no i cannot
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-15 00:09:09	i was going to complain that it's 2014 and there's no neopets app but apparently there IS A NEOPETS APP
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-15 05:08:19	@smicksssmack the neoexplorer app is the one im using, its not malware its just people clicking the ads without realizing lol
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-15 05:08:49	@smicksssmack but neopets loads like ahit on mobile, full stop. but itll be kinda nostalgic since the internet was terrible back in the day?
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-15 06:16:48	i love famous animals they have no idea

94913672	kaieous	2014-12-19 00:10:58	i know what i have in common with this girl but one doesnt really start a conversation with "hey so i heard you have panic attacks!"
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-19 22:48:42	"What are you dolled up for? Hot date?" "Well Daniella is coming over." "So yes."
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-19 01:26:28	hey self, being anxious in a social situation doesnt mean you aren't recovered from the worst of your anxiety.

94913672	kaieous	2014-12-20 07:59:05	why would anything come in a package of 9?
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-18 01:24:19	@MittRomney @JosephBarone @SonyPictures @TheInterview that's.... actually a solid idea.....

94913672	kaieous	2014-12-21 01:54:01	"but these cops were killed for NO REASON!!!" you mean like mike brown? interesting.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-21 01:58:02	That is the scariest possible thing. They just announced a militarized police state. Next thing, they'll have a ThoughtPolice division.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-21 23:25:37	some1 who hasnt gotten me an xmas gift should make me a tattoo appointment. you dont have to pay im just 2 nervous to make one and go alone.

94913672	kaieous	2014-12-23 18:34:09	Taylor Swift has come a really long way in terms of her feminism and self-empowerment. I am impressed.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-23 22:21:38	having family christmas today but pretty sure my mom is still mad at me so im hiding until my brother or boyfriend shows up
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-24 00:38:03	thing is, no one said cops' lives didnt matter. they just said that they should stop killing unarmed black people.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-24 16:16:34	The easiest way to make what happened last night in Berkeley not like Ferguson is to bring justice to #AntonioMartin's murderer. Simple.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-24 16:24:04	Really wish Facebook would translate Norwegian. Would be nice to understand my grandma's statuses.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-24 16:24:49	Related: the fuck did my cousin snapchat me? I'm assuming Merry Christmas but again, I don't speak a fucking word of Norwegian.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-23 04:12:57	the grumpy cat christmas movie is exactly what i needed to get into the holiday spirit
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-24 01:45:42	i know that horoscopes are designed to be really vague so people are like "omg thats so true!" but im not very gemini at all.

94913672	kaieous	2014-12-24 02:30:46	@smicksssmack whenever i see you do this on my feed i judge and then realize its you like "it ok she cool she cool"
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-24 02:32:28	i totally love that the jolie-pitt family is respecting their son john's wish to be identified as such (prevoously known as shiloh)
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-24 02:33:21	maybe i read stargirl too many times but i fully believe parents should let kids run their own identities, even if it changes over time.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-24 02:36:32	@borderlinefemme they are really incredible parents. i like to think that for each critic, there's someone out there who learns something.

94913672	kaieous	2014-12-26 14:44:48	have you ever read advice on anxiety that seems like it was written by someone who has never felt nervous?
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-26 14:45:24	"Have an extra cup of coffee before your first day of work so you're extra peppy!" is a panic attack waiting to happen.

94913672	kaieous	2014-12-27 06:52:49	@WeThePlums Nick says he wouldn't because he's a man and doesn't like men. I find it very strange.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-27 07:24:07	@WeThePlums I feel like it should. Though he insists he'd rather talk to himself which I think would be so boring.
94913672	kaieous	2014-12-27 08:34:41	ive been awake for 20 hours but i spent half of them unsuccessfully looking for the ps4 destiny bundle with nick.....

94913672	kaieous	2014-12-27 23:26:37	@AskPlayStation I see you have no ETA, does that mean at least a few hours? Trying to decide if I should wait or go socialize.

94913672	kaieous	2015-01-04 22:06:26	@borderlinefemme she literally said absolutely nothing. "I don't acknowledge oppression in my life and enjoy traditional feminine roles." ok

94913672	kaieous	2015-01-05 03:15:00	@kaieous pun not intended but im pretty happy with myself for it
94913672	kaieous	2015-01-06 22:55:38	so today i was warned that clients will argue that neutering will immasculate their dog or make the dog less macho
94913672	kaieous	2015-01-06 22:56:13	that is ridiculous. gender identity is a human social construct. dogs have no concept of masculinity.

94913672	kaieous	2015-01-08 02:33:58	I have noticed something very interesting about both of my jobs in animal welfare. The organizations are FULL of women.
94913672	kaieous	2015-01-08 02:35:41	every administrative boss i have met at AC&amp;C has been a woman. and most of the ones I have not met are also women.

94913672	kaieous	2015-01-12 04:16:56	@MLGHoNoReD it's kind of sad that you will never appreciate a woman. they are rather great, but bye forever.

94913672	kaieous	2015-01-14 22:32:03	Animal Care and Control is a no-kill organization. We euthanize exclusively for medical and severe behavioral conditions.
94913672	kaieous	2015-01-14 22:33:26	Please do not call our At Risk lost "death row." These animals are at risk for euthanasia for health reasons and we WANT them to be saved.
94913672	kaieous	2015-01-14 22:34:30	@Faustrate what about like a ball of aluminum foil. seriously cheap and reduces static too.
94913672	kaieous	2015-01-14 22:37:13	Moreover, ACC of NYC has possibly the LOWEST euthanasia rate of any city in the country. My job is to keep it that way by placing animals.
94913672	kaieous	2015-01-14 22:38:56	If you want to protest the unfair treatment of animals in shelters, protest PETA. PETA kills something like 93% of the animals.
94913672	kaieous	2015-01-14 22:39:41	The animals PETA does not kill, they use for their sexist and body-shaming vegan propaganda commercials. So there's that.

94913672	kaieous	2015-01-17 01:03:54	@borderlinefemme its law in nyc, animals cant leave unaltered unless they are sick.

94913672	kaieous	2015-01-17 01:16:17	@borderlinefemme luckily we have lots of rescue programs in the area to take the burden off us, but it certainly is. we can only do our best

94913672	kaieous	2015-01-17 00:28:35	protip if you want to save animals from being euthanized, spay/neuter the ones you have. starts with you.
94913672	kaieous	2015-01-17 17:30:56	@kaieous plus even people who are scared of big dogs can find love in a pocket pitty~
94913672	kaieous	2015-01-18 18:32:26	"So how long do you guys keep the animals?" Until they are placed. They don't have time limits. They're animals, not bombs.
94913672	kaieous	2015-01-17 15:01:51	do you ever read a recipe and just know the person who wrote it was broke as fuck?

94913672	kaieous	2015-01-20 00:04:10	"The dogs ate an hour ago." "No one told me." You walked in and commented on it. There's no issue, you can just admit you made a mistake????

94913672	kaieous	2015-01-20 05:19:23	according to my mom aspen pees on things and doesnt know the "sit" command so i think he just put on this angel act when im around?
94913672	kaieous	2015-01-20 15:59:24	it's 2015 can we stop telling people we dont care about their social media posts? they dont care that you dont care.
94913672	kaieous	2015-01-20 15:59:52	idk about you guys but i post things here because i want to say them, not because i particularly think someone will care?

94913672	kaieous	2015-02-17 22:02:05	@dizzy_peach @borderlinefemme yeah, there's a reclamation theme in the movie, though it does definitely lack genuine diversity.
94913672	kaieous	2015-02-18 00:53:52	@borderlinefemme I think she develops a sense of personal style (in the duff) as opposed to having a makeover and becomes self-assured
94913672	kaieous	2015-02-18 00:54:44	@borderlinefemme Like I won't say she ever qualifies as ugly or fat but there is a reclamation of the term "duff" and self-confidence themes

94913672	kaieous	2015-02-17 05:50:18	@pitbull why dont you use your fame to oppose breed-specific legislation
94913672	kaieous	2015-02-17 05:50:49	@pitbull or to fight against the idea that ANY dog, regardless of breed, is inherently bad or violent.

94913672	kaieous	2015-02-19 04:39:30	Kind of hard to imagine pichu being 7. 7 years ago, I had a sister who was an actual semi-sane part of my family. That's wild.
94913672	kaieous	2015-02-19 04:40:35	But obviously, Pichu's birthday isn't about her. It's about everything we've been through together in 7 years (including her several times.)
94913672	kaieous	2015-02-19 04:41:21	Happy birthday, Pichu. I hope your dreams are full of dinosaurs and your birthday wish to meet them comes true.

94913672	kaieous	2015-03-02 22:37:36	@kaieous &amp;refuses to go look for the cat bc he cant go near where the cat was lost from? sounds like u let the cat in the middle of ur shit.

94913672	kaieous	2015-03-02 17:31:32	a woman came in just to thank my coworker for pushing her to take an adult dog when she wanted a puppy, apparently the dog is the best ever.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-04 17:03:10	Had a horrible dream that my boyfriend was dying. Woke up and cried, went back to sleep. Has wonderful dream that he got lotsa job offers.

94913672	kaieous	2015-03-06 18:36:04	staten island people with nothing to do should come down to the shelter, we have some of the sweetest cats right now.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-06 21:02:12	@MySmartPuppy Hi, thanks for the follow! I actually have your book, it's very entertaining and helpful. (ps - Love the Westie header!)
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-06 21:08:20	Look at my new friend Snowball. He's very affectionate and has so many toes (and is available for adoption at SIACC!) http://t.co/hFCuVes4Px
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-06 02:29:59	@altonbrown so i know im behind on ctk but two weeks in a row there is chocolate fish! i am now tempted.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-07 02:29:11	@MasterKeyX I told you I had blue hair....
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-07 02:41:17	is there a way to block a website from coming up in your google searches? seeing "cesarsway" every time I search dog behavior makes me sick.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-07 02:43:08	@Dojorkan thank you!
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-07 05:28:09	@manddddddee your loss, I exclusively send you cats.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-07 05:30:27	@manddddddee oooo ye okay. as long as youre not missin the cats.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-07 18:28:45	... This place didn't just call me about my food order and not leave a message, right?
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-07 21:12:04	read an article by a scientist claiming that dogs clearly do not remember the past because they are excited each time he enters the backyard
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-07 21:13:22	@kaieous have you considered that your dogs like you? and are genuinely excited that you are near them again?
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-08 12:57:33	I had to shoo pigeons off my window AC this morning. It really is spring!
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-08 15:07:57	someone should pull Butter, Blackie Love or Minino from the at-risk list in the next 50 minutes because they are all sweet cats.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-09 18:10:07	@StellaArtois Are there more than just the two?
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-09 02:59:51	@StellaArtois This is relevant to my interests.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-09 21:07:00	If you're charging me an extra $75/night and not providing him with any amenities, are you really a pet-friendly hotel?
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-09 21:08:55	@kaieous Like at least get the boy a chew toy or doggie bed if you're going to charge that kind of fee. It's less to have another person!
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-09 15:37:42	@alliharvard your shoulders look fantastic, have you been working on them? :)
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-09 17:21:18	Note to all landlords, management companies and homeowners assoc.: There is NO SUCH THING as an "aggressive breed dog." That is meaningless.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-10 04:17:17	sometimes i think about how great dogs are and i start shaking so if youre wondering why i have a new handle (besides here), it is that.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-10 03:45:22	Oh hey I have 2000 tumblr followers. When did that happen?
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-11 06:14:50	Me: "I get it's a critique, but sexism in that show makes me cringe."
Man: "What?! It's not sexist at all, the female characters do stuff."
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-11 16:58:54	"Pigs are the smartest barnyard animal." Pigs are the smartest nonhuman animals. Try again.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-11 17:00:37	@kaieous *land animals. Don't let me forget the intelligence of dolphins dammit.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-13 04:11:34	@petewentz does your dog travel with you or just miss you like crazy?

94913672	kaieous	2015-03-14 18:06:16	I never want to do one thing for so long that I become cynical about it.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-14 18:15:24	I think someone came in to look at a cat because of the bio I wrote on him #supermodelcat
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-14 18:19:41	@WeThePlums I write songs about absolutely nothing in my voice memos.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-14 18:21:39	@WeThePlums let's please do that
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-13 17:47:15	Pro tip: if your cat sleeps outside and doesn't have a litterbox, THE CAT IS NOT YOUR CAT. He or she is a stray cat that you feed sometimes.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-13 17:51:15	@kaieous If you want to spay/neuter, vaccinate, feed and protect strays, that's great and wonderful, but they're still not yours.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-14 22:46:08	bouta have a girls' night by myself
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-14 23:16:29	Thank you @barkbox for making today puppy christmas :)
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-15 00:44:43	today is the most accurate pi day ever because it's 3.1415
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-15 00:54:26	@borderlinefemme imo fixing things should be less painful and costly than ending it. if it isn't, then it should end. path of least pain.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-15 00:54:49	@borderlinefemme not that either decision is easy to make.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-15 00:58:54	@borderlinefemme listening is the #1 most important part!

94913672	kaieous	2015-03-16 16:39:06	Hey friends!! If you want to see cute shelter animals, add my Snapchat, puppy-kisser! (I promise, NO sad or guilt posts!)
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-16 17:06:47	Dear body,
It is extremely dumb to be allergic to cats. You work full-time handling cats for a living. Please cease congestion.
Thanks.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-16 19:50:21	ATTENTION WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF KITTENS. LOTS OF KITTENS. http://t.co/14PrRCbWZf
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-15 13:14:08	@HereBeHuskies almost entirely certain there's no wolf in those pups.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-16 20:20:54	I think I want to bleach out one big chunk of my hair and dye it to match my work shirt. I would look hella coordinated.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-16 21:14:05	@manddddddee come play if you're free :)
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-16 21:53:35	@manddddddee we close at 8 tonight and i dont work here again until friday but there will be kittens until they each get adopted!
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-15 15:22:32	attention people we have kittens. kitten alert. i repeat, kittens.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-17 01:11:03	WE'RE NOT GETTING FERRETS BUT WE'RE GETTING A FUCKING CHICK-FIL-A. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE DISAPPOINTED, NEW YORK.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-17 02:56:10	sometimes aspen cries at me and begs for nothing and i realize he is just begging for attention and it makes me sad.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-18 16:02:25	people keep trying to compliment me but i turn out to be a dirtbag like "oh did you do something to your hair?" "i washed it."
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-19 14:17:09	I am doing adoptions in my sleep now apparently. Have a nice life, dream cat.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-19 02:20:00	At Jose Tejas for the first time!
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-19 16:21:31	Look what I found~ http://t.co/InEHKUY6hO
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-17 20:05:23	hi if you cant afford a $50 adoption fee you cannot afford to have a cat goodbye
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-19 23:09:55	Calling 911 like, "Are you hiring? Can I speak to a manager?"
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-20 01:24:47	I'm very concerned about country music. What does "You be Louisiana, I'll be your Mississippi" mean? What does that MEAN?!
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-21 22:55:48	Just catcalled someone's dog from my car. In my defense, dog was beautiful.

94913672	kaieous	2015-03-21 15:01:26	A cat gave birth here today in the shelter. I am in the presence of kittens that are only hours old.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-22 16:02:12	Rolling my eyes forever at people who think 6 month old kittens are too big.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-21 18:44:02	Last time I bought food I shared my fruit but not my soda and they drank my soda anyway. So now I'm buying lots of snacks for only me.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-21 18:46:28	@kaieous AGGRESSIVELY LABELING MY SNACKS
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-20 18:32:55	@CuteEmergency This dog looks really frightened.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-20 21:28:56	Trying makes things harder but it doesn't always make them end better. Consider what is and is not worth trying.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-22 19:53:23	@MadisonDDuPree @SDuPreeBemis wow she got so big..!
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-23 16:00:03	Have to do evals on 5 ringworm cats today so they can get out of here so I am probably about to get ringworm.

94913672	kaieous	2015-03-23 23:39:16	@smicksssmack i think people sometimes really believe a pit bull puppy playing with them is life-threatening
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-25 03:21:28	"@NYCACC: SPIDEY is ready for a forever home. @NYCACC http://t.co/XhPBCRlsJc http://t.co/rKbWFr0r0J" He is as silly as he looks.

94913672	kaieous	2015-03-26 02:29:04	.@BarackObama WHY DIDN'T YOU ADOPT A SHELTER DOG
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-26 03:31:48	I'm upset that I set up my @CamioCam in my bedroom but my dog never went in there today..... I miss him.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-27 15:16:49	@AgitatedFalcon If you're part of a group that's being criticized but the criticism doesn't apply to you, why be offended?
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-27 15:17:20	@AgitatedFalcon I find it ignorant and hurtful when women voice their struggles and men make it about them :/
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-27 15:19:29	@AgitatedFalcon Correcting a woman as she voices her struggle is making it about you. Which it isn't.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-27 15:21:07	@AgitatedFalcon now you're mansplaining. You made this about you and then got offended it was about you.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-27 15:21:27	@AgitatedFalcon That's not a real struggle. Instead of correcting women, correct your male peers.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-27 15:22:10	@AgitatedFalcon But you're not doing that. You're fighting for yourself and silencing women.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-27 15:23:10	Dear men,

It is never your place to tell women what hurts the feminist movement. Thanks.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-27 15:24:16	@AgitatedFalcon No, you're trying to talk over me on women's issues.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-27 15:26:05	@AgitatedFalcon Can't teach someone who isn't listening :)

94913672	kaieous	2015-03-28 21:03:26	literally am ignoring people who claim any breed of dog is fine except a pit bull. there is nothing wrong with our pit bulls.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-28 21:05:16	if you're refusing to adopt a pit because of their breed name, i don't even want you to be the person who adopts a non-pit from us.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-28 21:09:01	if you want something specific, something small, something mellow, or cannot have pits per your landlord, i will do my best to help.
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-28 21:11:19	@kaieous but if you're telling me mastiffs and shepherds are good with you and pits aren't "because you have kids" get a fucking grip!
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-28 21:13:41	&amp; if you are the kind of person who emails our adoptions account with some rescue pit story saying we're murderers maybe u should adopt one?

*regularly misses hanging out with their dogs*
94913672	kaieous	2015-03-30 03:20:59	@kaieous This applies to more than one person, but that's because dogs are perfect even if their humans are assholes.

94913672	kaieous	2015-04-11 19:13:15	@MasterKeyX @TheOnion @hypnoticmermaid the best. Cons: you have to go to a place.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-12 16:42:21	i wish people's birthdays happened when i had good ideas for their gifts. there is a good chance i will lose these.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-12 17:07:37	Today's theme is My Little Pony which means I just named this pretty stray cat Fluttershy~
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-12 17:55:08	My supervisor the dog behaviorist did not question or challenge my assertion that my dog has a favorite color.

94913672	kaieous	2015-04-11 21:27:50	@xdarkling this breed was literally bred to look like a sheep.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-11 21:31:45	@xdarkling interestingly, this dog is not any form of a Sheepdog or Shepherd and is in fact, a Beddlington Terrier
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-11 21:46:11	There are people who do not care enough &amp; there are people who care too much about the wrong things &amp; they are both exhausting customers.

94913672	kaieous	2015-04-12 13:25:02	It took 3 months for the honeymoon phase of this job to wear off, but here it is.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-14 04:31:55	Had to call 311 today because of road kill that wasn't cleaned up for three days and then was joined by a friend. :( Maybe we need a fence.

94913672	kaieous	2015-04-15 01:17:57	You know how they say if you are attracted to/love someone you like their smell? Have you ever sniffed puppy paws?
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-15 01:19:28	@kaieous Dogs only sweat through their paws, and LET ME TELL YOU they smell awesome.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-15 01:26:27	I visited Joe today. He has the cutest lil stubbly tail, and it just waggles when you talk to him! https://t.co/4i0ZntbdoK
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-15 04:21:53	Just realized my entire outfit today is made up of clothes that were technically pajamas but that I bought to wear in public.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-16 06:12:06	That was enlightening. Large group dynamic is stupid.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-18 13:58:16	Can't wait to have that left arm driving tan 💪

94913672	kaieous	2015-04-17 16:48:01	Why do bad things happen to nice cats? 😿
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-19 03:56:31	Making a few commitments. First and foremost to my hair, which has always been good to me and deserves the satin pillowcase I ordered it.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-19 03:57:46	Committing to my dogs who deserve daily walks beyond the backyard and dedicated playtime when it rains.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-19 03:59:07	Committing to my environment. It's a symptom of stress to live in squalor, but it wears on me. Simple as picking clothes up.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-19 04:01:17	@kaieous I have realized that increased indigo makes hair brown, so instead I bought Special Effects. Feel like a teenager again.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-18 01:50:07	@theBlueBennu @ninajaybee you probably just need an adult hoop :)

94913672	kaieous	2015-04-23 04:50:20	Realizing that a bad day for my mom is a few snappy comments and not intentionally hurtful screaming like it was. Big improvement!
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-23 16:09:45	Meant to get up an hour ago but my dog is lying on my foot.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-23 00:33:51	http://t.co/foRUhZ9lKl Ran into this guy today on our wall through the Mount Loretto Forest. He rattled away at Aspen!
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-24 18:28:10	me: "do a proper introduction and do not assume your pet will immediately get along with a new pet"
adopters, apparently: "no"
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-26 02:47:20	I would just like everyone to know that there are dozens of solutions to every pet problem. No pet medical/behavioral issue is unique.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-26 02:48:45	There are even solutions to most personal problems that affect your pet. Ask a professional for help before giving up. It's usually free.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-26 02:50:11	That's exactly what your local shelter and SPCA are for - primarily, to help YOU with your animal, not to take them from you.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-26 02:50:57	I feel like there are so many people who have "tried and given up" by the time they get to the shelter - why haven't we heard from you?
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-26 03:20:12	.@cesarmillan is a violent misogynist with dangerous views of dog training, and I flinch whenever I hear pet parents reference him.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-25 01:18:33	@falloutboy I'm still mourning hydrafest is that ever going to happen.

94913672	kaieous	2015-04-25 14:54:28	I'm putting together a kitten mailing list. If you want to be informed when we have a new litter of kittens please send me your email :)

94913672	kaieous	2015-04-26 22:20:32	@borderlinefemme It feels like he's implying that feminist women are ugly, he isn't ugly because he isn't a woman. gross.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-28 16:25:02	I darkened my hair and started wearing lipstick and all the guys working in brooklyn are like "... nice."
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-27 00:23:44	When I was a little girl I genuinely believed that I could understand what neighborhood dogs were saying when they barked.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-27 00:28:23	I taught my friend across the street to do it. One day I heard a dog yell for help, and my friend called to ask if I had heard it.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-27 00:30:46	It's really a wonder I ever thought I would want to do anything other than help animals.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-28 19:43:52	@jk_rowling @gallantgranger you have WESTIES
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-27 14:00:04	It upsets me when I see apartments listed "no pets." 60+% of US households have at least one pet. 60+% of apartments don't allow them.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-27 14:01:36	Further, it is absolutely absurd that in NYC, 90% of the dogs in the shelter are pit mixes, and city housing doesn't allow them.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-27 14:02:43	I thought New Yorkers worked together. @NYCHA is abandoning the city's animals for no actual good reason.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-27 16:39:47	@Annalphabette @grlforce @borderlinefemme I see that, as the point of the hashtag, but it makes the "not all feminists" comment irrelevant.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-28 23:40:47	@Soyacide They are certainly all offensive, but I don't believe they are equal, at least not here in the US, due to current race relations.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-28 23:42:44	@borderlinefemme Vegan activists, at least. It's almost hard to believe, but quiet vegans do exist, and I feel sorry for them.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-28 23:49:06	@borderlinefemme it's frustrating! my condolences to your friends for the actions of the representing vegans.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-27 19:53:46	@mysmartpuppy my dog loves chewing on metal (jewelry, zippers, etc). I try to redirect him, but rubber doesn't seem to cut it - suggestions?

94913672	kaieous	2015-05-02 00:05:36	Somehow turned what was going to be a customer service nightmare into a beautiful adoption. My favorite dog has a home now.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-02 00:09:40	Admittedly, this is her FIFTH home. I don't want to say it's forever, but it's pretty much her last shot, and this person can make it work.
94913672	kaieous	2015-04-30 17:58:35	The guy that runs this parking lot tried to steal my car. "I need your key bc there are no spaces" while I am staring at one.

94913672	kaieous	2015-05-02 21:18:15	Our name theme for today is "Olympic Sports" and I named a cat Trampoline.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-02 21:23:43	@kaieous I actually named 3 kittens after gymnastics: Artistic, Rhythmic and Trampoline.

94913672	kaieous	2015-05-03 01:03:51	Got out of work late, so the dogs got baths instead of walks - very, very needed baths. Did you know Westies were white?
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-03 01:58:15	who is she ? http://t.co/nEjEKV3BHT
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-04 17:08:58	I would complain that the shelter doesn't have wifi until I remember that taxpayers would be paying for me to browse pinterest on my phone.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-04 04:49:41	do wealthy philanthropic people watch anime on hulu? why are there so many charity ads?
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-03 16:02:43	@MySmartPuppy 
Aspen rolls over
He wants a belly rubbing,
What a good puppy.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-03 22:05:56	Someone apparently left a very friendly squirrel right outside the shelter who is eating peanuts out of hands and hiding in people's hair.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-04 16:32:21	@altonbrown what's the best way to prepare cold-brewed coffee?
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-05 15:39:30	I'm honestly shaken up that the Hess on New Dorp/Hylan is a Speedway now. That place is like a cornerstone of my life.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-05 15:59:50	@MariaPianelli I noticed this morning so within the past like 2 days.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-05 16:06:12	@MariaPianelli I know :( I feel the urge to move far away now.

94913672	kaieous	2015-05-07 02:05:11	@Soyacide Better be some amazing pizza.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-07 02:10:04	Debate is monumentally different from a fight. Even an argument is worthwhile if something of substance is said.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-05 17:24:25	@MariaPianelli yes please :D
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-06 16:20:05	I really need to work on my dog's brand. He's almost a year old and he's only seen 3 snowy mountains.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-06 16:48:00	I'm throwing crap out that I no longer want or need. I'm holding onto it for a week in case anyone wants it: follow @katupurge.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-06 16:55:25	I am giving this stuff away free. I'll drop off on Staten Island. If you want it shipped we'll cut a deal.

94913672	kaieous	2015-05-07 01:18:37	Sometimes it still psychs me out to think I was in Italy once? Europe is so far.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-08 20:18:10	@hulu_support The one where a man removes his tooth with pliers is really disrupting my viewing experience of a friendly adventure anime.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-08 20:18:56	@hulu_support I mostly watch TV to relax before bed and watching that commercial gave me heartburn that kept me up for an hour.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-08 20:19:44	@hulu_support Like, I don't want to see it enough times to say it isn't relevant to me, and I doubt I can even do that on my Smart TV.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-08 20:49:01	I hate when I stop hydrating well for a few days and then get back on it and my body decides to piss out my hard work.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-08 02:24:11	Yes, everything in my life DOES revolve around my dog - including what we did for mother's day :) @thepaintplaceny http://t.co/3uRcASipA4
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-08 14:20:57	@hulu @huluplus @hulu_support One of the commercials that airs makes me VERY uncomfortable, is there a way I can have it stop appearing?

94913672	kaieous	2015-05-11 19:02:30	@kaieous i know im serious serious but she'll be available tomorrow - she's spayed, vaccinated, 10 months old and a GSD/terrier mix.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-12 00:19:09	Part of my job training was "Does this dog want a belly rub?"

94913672	kaieous	2015-05-18 15:05:37	Was scheduled for training in Brooklyn today 2 hours before we open and the person who was supposed to run it forgot.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-18 15:06:18	It's cool and all that I'm here today, but she better not expect me to get up early to do this again. Come to Staten Island, you fucked up.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-19 15:41:21	I literally cannot think of a single appropriate reason to return a dog 12 hours after you take her home.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-19 15:42:24	Even seriously aggressive behavior is likely the result of the stress of a new environment, new family, plus being achey from surgery.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-19 15:45:21	"IN REASON: PERS PROB"

It's not really as if any animal comes here for any reason other than the owner's personal problems...

94913672	kaieous	2015-05-22 21:36:31	it's really hard not to blame people for the euthanasia of their pets in the shelter, but it's not really any more their fault than ours

94913672	kaieous	2015-05-27 00:09:04	I actually hate this post  even though it's horrible to make your s/o choose between you and a pet. https://t.co/VUtjW7Bjr6
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-27 00:12:39	Simply because the opposite-gendered version is nice. "Ginger and named Tom. Friendly. Comes when called. Works in IT."
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-27 03:05:26	the only good thing about Pitch Perfect was @RebelWilson. i like @AnnaKendrick47.. i do.. but her character was so "special snowflake"

94913672	kaieous	2015-05-26 01:20:05	@kaieous maybe i can make it that he's laying on a pillow?
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-26 01:27:58	people say that i am very opinionated but i just do not speak unless i have something to say. you'll notice i'm present but quiet often.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-26 02:22:23	@borderlinefemme The more I think about "a cool girl, not a chill girl" the more relatable it is.
94913672	kaieous	2015-05-26 02:24:24	being forced to multitask because neither of your dogs will let you pay attention to the other

94913672	kaieous	2015-05-29 15:26:34	Nothing is more distracting to education than sweltering heat. If you want people to show less skin, make school colder.

94913672	kaieous	2015-05-31 14:55:33	@MasterKeyX That party was in your timehop too? Seriously... that guy was an asshole.

94913672	kaieous	2015-06-01 02:38:26	@ny1desk The Staten Island Animal Shelter in Tottenville also flooded.. animals out safe, but no services until further notice.
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-03 01:18:49	@smicksssmack Oh my god, I'm so sorry for your loss :(
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-03 02:14:26	.Ordered @Mangia_Healthy from grubhub today and not a SINGLE thing came as described - no dressing for salad, no toppings on sandwich.
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-03 14:01:17	@borderlinefemme this is so exciting!!
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-04 17:04:28	@xdarkling I think I'm taking them here: http://t.co/bjGDkgNYr0 Seems like they just help needy people, no politics involved.
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-02 18:32:28	@WeThePlums @MariaPianelli @MasterKeyX Was thinking the same - new place, new experiences, but not the same as having a moment at home.

94913672	kaieous	2015-06-05 00:33:27	@bitchesaboutmen People like that are certainly out there. They are rare, but you'll find one.
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-04 04:04:39	i have some very cute very wearable clothing i want to donate but obviously salvation army and goodwill both suck please help
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-04 00:19:54	Ordered a very good kitty friend a @KitNipBox and I think he likes it! Loved the sensitive tummy option too :) http://t.co/ljPMiQRgHq
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-05 16:52:56	This woman is very insistent that her dog is "not a shelter dog." Okay, but you lost your dog, and he is at the shelter now.
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-05 16:54:16	I would normally be annoyed at statements like "The cute one is adopted" but HE IS AN 8 MONTH OLD JACK RUSSELL EEK HE IS TOO CUTE
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-04 14:28:32	@MasterKeyX @WeThePlums lol quality lipstick shouldnt be.
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-05 18:35:20	Hey if y'all have NY1 one of my adopters is going to be on, interviewed about her new dog and our current promotion!
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-07 14:34:39	Love when people trap ear-tipped cats because they "make a mess" bc those cats are going to be released back where you found them.
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-07 01:29:20	Since when is this score even possible? http://t.co/KiJgE91fKn
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-08 00:14:38	Why is it SO HARD for some people to stay quiet when their point of view is irrelevant to the discussion? https://t.co/zVxpjLv3UP
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-08 02:40:39	i'm watching the 9/11 anime and i still can't believe this was created.
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-09 01:15:30	So many people say "It was hard learning about sexism/racism/homophobia/transphobia/etc. - I see it everywhere." But isn't it better?
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-09 01:16:20	I'm not saying everyone should pick every fight. Or any fights, even. But don't resist what you know is progress because it's inconvenient.
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-09 01:21:35	@borderlinefemme if "all men" is not specified, why do people assume it refers to that? men. some men.
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-09 02:09:40	@MasterKeyX i love that you'll be with me to call me on my shit
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-09 02:41:18	@Dojorkan absolutely, but it seems many people get angry at where the knowledge came from, not the problem itself.
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-09 02:47:47	@Dojorkan My tweets refer to this. It's the fault of the young because they are aware and speak out. http://t.co/8Sv4oWVYo8
94913672	kaieous	2015-06-09 03:32:07	Interesting that I'm in such a demographic that acne medicine and hard cider are being advertised to me.
