987827204	austin_okoren	2014-03-06 04:10:06	People say things get better but it's really like rolling down a steep hill

987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-05 05:54:04	I really don't think you want my honest opinion...
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-06 23:28:38	Blowing things way out of proportion
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-06 23:36:39	Why would you go telling stories to everyone that aren't true? I never once spoke a bad word about you...but I guess you feel your own way
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-07 01:06:55	Pretty fucked up... I'm a 17 year old that needs to take medicine just so I can sleep. I need to turn things around and start over

987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-06 01:38:02	Can't even count the number of people I curse off in my head
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-06 04:23:29	Words are powerful... Once you say them that's it you can't take them back. Even if you didn't mean it you still felt it and said it...
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-06 09:02:24	I can never sleep anymore... Up all hours of the night 😣😣

987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-06 09:31:49	We live in a world where people only view things from their own prospective
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-08 01:59:43	What I choose as a career is up to me... I'll hear your opinion but you think everything I say is a bad idea...
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-08 02:17:39	In my house if we want someone else to do something you have to threaten them that you're going to hide their stuff on them 😂😂

987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-08 19:25:51	The first time it happens it's your fault. The second time it's my fault because I would have allowed it to happen again...

987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-12 15:54:05	So far today's been a day from hell and it's not even 12 o'clock yet
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-12 15:57:09	This guy must be at least 60 years old and he's earring a lunchables on his break... MY LIFE IS A JOKE 🙌🙌

987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-13 06:40:27	Watch me wake up tomorrow 10 minutes before work then realize I don't have a clean uniform. Then I will curse off everyone in this house 😃😃
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-14 00:31:45	You need to show respect to other people and not just your self
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-14 02:55:16	Gotta go with your gut 👌👌
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-14 02:56:10	Today was a really shitty day, hopefully tomorrow's better
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-14 02:57:28	It's not good to keep everything bottled up inside....
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-14 02:58:47	Sometimes people don't want to hear what you have to say because they're too afraid to face the truth...
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-14 03:07:01	It's really time for some change
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-14 03:13:25	Why do I care so much? I let some of the stupidest things fuck with my mind...
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-14 17:43:43	Nothing better then shopping for clothes for Florida 😝😝
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-14 18:04:10	@FrankDapillow31 okay I'll try not to. Thanks 👌👌
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-14 23:55:16	I can't even eat my dinner without someone at this table fuckin starting shit with me
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-15 02:05:39	Hmmm...I wonder when I should start doing my summer reading considering I leave for vacation soon and come back the day before school starts
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-15 03:13:55	I'm not even going to ask 😡😡
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-15 03:19:02	All I have to say is what the fuck is wrong with you.... Like seriously what are you thinking...??
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-15 15:23:23	@yenttirbd I need another cup! Lol
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-15 15:24:08	Don't bring me down with you...
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-18 21:06:23	@kmcircle97 "did you just land off of mars?" Lol
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-19 01:32:12	Like I said.... I work at a pre school, where I get paid to babysit five year olds...
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-19 01:34:20	I feel like there's something you're not telling me 😁😁
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-19 01:36:02	Tomorrow's going to be another long ass day, then I'm off for two days, work another three, then VACATION for almost two weeks 🙌🙌🙌
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-19 01:57:10	Sometimes saying no words gets the point across better then saying everything that comes to mind...
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-19 02:05:33	Try being your own person for once...
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-17 01:30:30	@melissabelle21 MY RESPONSE WAS 10x better 😂😂
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-17 02:20:01	I will never forgive myself for this...
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-17 02:20:30	This isn't who I am... I need to learn to talk about what's bothering me...
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-17 02:24:21	A part of me died today... I might have acted like it's not bothering me but the truth is it's eating me away...
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-17 02:26:22	I wasn't raised like this... I need to get it together and fix things...
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-17 14:47:04	I blame myself for everything... Who am I? How did I let all of this happen?
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-17 14:53:16	Don't act on what's bothering you at that exact moment because all it's going to do is make you make a huge mistake.... Trust me
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-19 12:40:18	@yenttirbd not even coffees going to help me lol. I need something stronger 😬😬
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-19 20:58:41	Well this should be fun 😑😑
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-20 04:53:02	I will never have to do this again in my entire life 🙌🙌
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-21 16:26:46	Suitcase packed for vacation ✅

987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-23 03:32:51	Watch who you let influence your life because sometimes not all advice is good advice....
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-23 11:34:49	Idk what shift I hate more 11-7 or 12-8.... Watch with my luck I'm going to have to flip shit on one of these rude ass people today...

987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-24 02:21:18	People fuckin judge when they don't even know what the fucks goin on
987827204	austin_okoren	2014-08-24 02:26:55	I feel like an old man that has to take medicine for everything... 👴👴
