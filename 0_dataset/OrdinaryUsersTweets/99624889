99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-03 11:05:40	Thought someone had a load of tattoos on their back. Nope... It's their matted chest hair 😩
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-01 10:12:54	I've discovered a clever trick with my sunburn and tan line I've put loads of sun cream on my burnt bits and then on my tan lines I haven't
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-01 10:13:36	I don't care if I'm burnt all over as long as I haven't got tan lines
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 08:50:44	It's a rainbow bruise🌈 http://t.co/bTbCHGPRMf
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 08:54:59	People with fringes need to stay away from me because the temptation to cut one back in is ridic
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 09:06:21	Nice coffee and mug ☕️ http://t.co/GiQKq75wvt
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-01 13:35:37	Off to the beach :-) http://t.co/PTp4WdGbCe
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 11:25:49	I'm not so red any more! It kind of looks a bit like a tan now yay
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 12:19:25	As people may know I'm not a ranty/angry person...
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 12:20:09	but... There's one thing that pisses me off more than anything!
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 12:20:50	FUCKING GERMANS RESERVING SEATS AT THE POOL! EVERY FUCKING MORNING THEY SAVE THEM AND IM SAT ON THE FUCKING FLOOR.
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 12:22:01	That is all. And if I see you do it I will not be afraid to set your fucking German towels on fire you fucking reserving knob jockeys
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 12:30:47	Think the Germans heard me because I got sun lounger. I'm happy. http://t.co/Mp9dFsbqqg
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 12:38:13	So many northern people here. Jesus their accents are annoying me.
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 12:40:20	Old guy, looks a bit like Rolf Harris lurking around the pool, currently under a bridge. Think I'll keep an eye out for him.
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 12:40:39	Don't think I'll be quite trusting swimming under the bridge.
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 12:42:14	He's playing with some kids now. I don't know if he knows them or not.
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 12:45:53	So glad it's hot because the sun is bleaching my chest hair. May have to go to a nudist beach and do my nipple hair too.
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 12:47:01	My parents have gonna back for lunch. But I'm doing my bit for the community and keeping an eye on Rolf.
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 12:49:17	That's Rolf lurking under the bridge. http://t.co/I9b6wJXD4h
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 12:54:42	What I like to do is slowly get ready to leave and watch all the Germans ready to pounce on my sun lounger. It brings me great joy.
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2014-08-02 12:55:21	Some last has sat behind me on the floor because I'm folding my towel. Back off bitch

99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2015-01-20 20:40:14	She can shut up, she's had KFC while on a diet, 29 calories per chocolate treat ain't bad. #weighinguptheenemy
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2015-01-20 20:43:08	I'm just generally shocked at this lady crying over veg #weighinguptheenemy
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2015-01-20 20:44:36	Of course you're stopping for chocolate you fat fuck #weighinguptheenemy

99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2015-01-20 20:50:56	"Did it all go to plan"
No it fucking didn't, she had KFC and in the last two weeks joined a gym. Big woop. #weighinguptheenemy
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2015-01-20 20:53:33	Yay, the hard worker actually won, #weighinguptheenemy

99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2015-01-20 21:21:27	@pdpickard @tommyfleet @peggymay_x yes but you became confrontational.
99624889	Alicemalaxoxo	2015-01-20 21:23:13	@pdpickard @tommyfleet @peggymay_x well you can carry on living wrong then.
